By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a download page where the clients for the installation can be downloaded. The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp When an attacker download a client for Windows and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Kaseya\\XXXXXXXXXX\\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent_Guid and AgentPassword This Agent_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9) This request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues discovered --- * Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials * Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie) that can be used for services not intended for use by agents * dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request * Access to KaseyaD.ini gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the Kaseya installation and its clients. Impact --- Via the page /dl.asp enough information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated) attacks against the system.", "datePublished": "2021-07-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-21T23:25:41", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/04/Kaseya-Case-Update-2/", "https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689-Important-Notice-July-2nd-2021", "https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/07/Kaseya-Limited-Disclosure/", "https://www.secpod.com/blog/kaseya-vsa-zero-day-by-revil/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30116", "https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2021-30116"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-30116"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 49.84, "exploitedSince": "2021-11-03T00:00:00", "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7601398e-14d6-3826-8fe7-af23a584823a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0151ab8c-4590-3e47-bf2e-c974f6806564", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": true}
