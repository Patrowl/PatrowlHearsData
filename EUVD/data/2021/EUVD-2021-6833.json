This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system.", "datePublished": "2021-02-17T16:55:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:40:40", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-dll-hijac-JrcTOQMC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1366"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.8, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "121ec73b-cf0d-3f2d-90e4-5b4a22afef8c", "product": {"name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83a4a2a1-bf8c-3354-af9f-e10a04ebfd43", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
