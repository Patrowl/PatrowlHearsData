Prior to version 2.4.13, there exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse. If one has a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header, then sending a request with a certain Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request is sent. In this case, the backend does not see the request header. A patch is available in version 2.4.13. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "datePublished": "2021-08-03T22:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/traefik/traefik/security/advisories/GHSA-m697-4v8f-55qg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32813", "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/8319/commits/cbaf86a93014a969b8accf39301932c17d0d73f9", "https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.13", "github.com/traefik/traefik", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32813.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32813"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32813", "GHSA-m697-4v8f-55qg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "96f2cfb4-652e-3d7c-ae1c-a55261a5c1a0", "product": {"name": "traefik"}, "product_version": "< 2.4.13"}, {"id": "bcca7587-be35-3c45-8797-d8effbef0db6", "product": {"name": "traefik"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.7.30"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9708bb7a-dc41-3d44-be4b-10157b5d2ab8", "vendor": {"name": "traefik"}}], "isExploited": false}
