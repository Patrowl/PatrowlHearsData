When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.", "datePublished": "2021-03-18T13:59:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:33:17", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2021-28133", "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2020-044.txt", "https://zoom.us/trust/security/security-bulletin", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SonmmgQlLzg", "https://www.syss.de/pentest-blog/syss-2020-044-sicherheitsproblem-in-screen-sharing-funktionalitaet-von-zoom-cve-2021-28133", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Mar/48", "https://thehackernews.com/2021/03/new-zoom-screen-sharing-bug-lets-other.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/161897/Zoom-5.4.3-54779.1115-5.5.4-13142.0301-Information-Disclosure.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28133"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "da3e00fa-d05a-3361-b632-ecc8e9a53d3b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c6d5b0a4-52c1-3850-af99-1f51056f46d2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
