In the current implementation in Xen, asynchronous notification of the completion of such commands is not used. Instead, the issuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of the most recently issued command(s). Some of these waiting loops try to apply a timeout to fail overly-slow commands. The course of action upon a perceived timeout actually being detected is inappropriate: - on Intel hardware guests which did not originally cause the timeout may be marked as crashed, - on AMD hardware higher layer callers would not be notified of the issue, making them continue as if the IOMMU operation succeeded.", "datePublished": "2021-06-30T10:27:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28692.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4931", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-28692.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-373.txt", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28692"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0004dd31-538b-3f8f-b7e8-de86d252b5f1", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.12.x"}, {"id": "0d9e2d23-0a25-31aa-abe0-2ae0c0790167", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.13.x"}, {"id": "2250c9a7-e4bd-38c4-8e98-cb23df6aa551", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.14.x"}, {"id": "2738ea44-d93a-3c49-8637-ba7faea71cdc", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.15.x"}, {"id": "8d591956-a4d9-3ae3-ad4f-9b9be81e760d", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.11.x"}, {"id": "f7b15ed1-411e-365c-9439-233c306c859a", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "xen-unstable"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "572660e5-d335-3f82-b8a2-fb9a00bfea84", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
