The RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite implementations in the Contiki-NG operating system versions prior to 4.6 do not validate the address pointer in the RPL source routing header This makes it possible for an attacker to cause out-of-bounds writes with packets injected into the network stack. Specifically, the problem lies in the rpl_ext_header_srh_update function in the two rpl-ext-header.c modules for RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite respectively. The addr_ptr variable is calculated using an unvalidated CMPR field value from the source routing header. An out-of-bounds write can be triggered on line 151 in os/net/routing/rpl-lite/rpl-ext-header.c and line 261 in os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-ext-header.c, which contain the following memcpy call with addr_ptr as destination. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.6. Users can apply a patch out-of-band as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2021-06-18T20:55:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-mvc7-9p4q-c5cm", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1431"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21257"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6be21ae3-c66f-3bcc-855e-46eb80064e29", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b771fe8a-9f59-3447-b10f-68a83a757885", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
