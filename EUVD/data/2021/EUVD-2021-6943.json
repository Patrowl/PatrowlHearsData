The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands that are supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input for specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying OS with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid administrator-level credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T17:30:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:23:34", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-cmd-inj-SELprvG"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1476"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4026fd42-ad9a-319a-92e2-6fb49210a1b9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53bb2ea5-8cc1-3438-ae3c-ffa403189a2a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
