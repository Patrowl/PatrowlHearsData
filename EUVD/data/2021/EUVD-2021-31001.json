As the session cookies are small, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.", "datePublished": "2021-12-13T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:17:23", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2021-44151", "https://reprisesoftware.com/admin/rlm-admin-download.php?&euagree=yes", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165191/Reprise-License-Manager-14.2-Session-Hijacking.html", "https://www.reprisesoftware.com/RELEASE_NOTES"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-44151"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "daa5ff1b-6965-3d6a-bab0-82abda8a9223", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f842169a-9868-3d89-9a71-05bf5e8c59ed", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
