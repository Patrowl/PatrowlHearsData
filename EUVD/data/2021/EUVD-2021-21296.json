This allows attackers to impersonate users and trigger an email address verification for arbitrary accounts, including administrative accounts, and automatically be logged in as that user, including any site administrators. This requires the Email Verification module to be active in the plugin and the Login User After Successful Verification setting to be enabled, which it is by default.", "datePublished": "2021-08-30T18:03:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T20:32:56", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/08/critical-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-patched-in-booster-for-woocommerce/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2581212%40woocommerce-jetpack&new=2581212%40woocommerce-jetpack&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34646"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 22.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c1ebabc-62a7-38f4-856e-95e7c6c4dcc5", "product": {"name": "Booster for WooCommcerce"}, "product_version": "5.4.3 \u22645.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b3cd7543-6d0c-3e6b-aec3-c5ed850cae52", "vendor": {"name": "Pluggabl LLC"}}], "isExploited": false}
