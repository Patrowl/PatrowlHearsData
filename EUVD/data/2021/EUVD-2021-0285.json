An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L162-L163) does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In turn, this results in the tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.h#L295-L306). However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 as this is the only other affected version.", "datePublished": "2021-05-14T20:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:29", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/20431e9044cf2ad3c0323c34888b192f3289af6b", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-6g85-3hm8-83f9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29544", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2021-472.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2021-670.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2021-181.yaml", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L162-L163", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.h#L295-L306", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29544.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29544"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29544", "GHSA-6g85-3hm8-83f9", "PYSEC-2021-472"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e5aea91d-a6bf-399f-bcc9-4fc8feb55711", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.4.0, < 2.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ca7ceaf1-bc46-35f0-b61b-273673d675ac", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
