This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a partial DoS condition on an affected system. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-05-06T12:51:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:16:00", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bwms-xxe-uSLrZgKs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1530"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cb57e916-7698-32e3-8aee-5b13e153ed73", "product": {"name": "Cisco BroadWorks"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "058b4ee7-1098-33f7-a50d-d96151577515", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
