OnlineVotingSystem before version 1.1.2 hashes user passwords without a salt, which is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Therefore there is a threat of security breach in the voting system. Without a salt, it is much easier for attackers to pre-compute the hash value using dictionary attack techniques such as rainbow tables to crack passwords. This problem is fixed and published in version 1.1.2. A long randomly generated salt is added to the password hash function to better protect passwords stored in the voting system.", "datePublished": "2021-01-21T14:20:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:14", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/security/advisories/GHSA-wwg8-372v-v332", "https://github.com/dbijaya/OnlineVotingSystem/commit/0181cb0272857696c8eb3e44fcf6cb014ff90f09"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21253"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c7ebfd3f-c54d-346e-ba6d-1e573b1266c6", "product": {"name": "OnlineVotingSystem"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94d19fa4-cbe1-3d7a-b011-17118b080231", "vendor": {"name": "dbijaya"}}], "isExploited": false}
