This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process for shared library files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid account on the system.", "datePublished": "2021-10-06T19:40:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:51:09", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-lib-hija-cAFB7x4q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34788"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f74e3cd7-69ac-3a12-8d7b-a589fac439d1", "product": {"name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1f89b690-083a-397d-b1b8-ea721af6d037", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
