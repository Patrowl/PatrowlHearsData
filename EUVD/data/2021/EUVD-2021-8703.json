This is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for \"prismaFmtBinPath\". That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is malicious and delete it.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T16:50:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:16", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/security/advisories/GHSA-4rf9-43m7-x828", "https://github.com/prisma/language-tools/pull/750", "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma", "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma-insider"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21415"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35c0b1fd-09ab-39fd-bf42-6e0dda24fd9b", "product": {"name": "language-tools"}, "product_version": "< 20.0.27"}, {"id": "a9cffa27-8bb5-3b11-82c3-8d5a6bbdfdeb", "product": {"name": "language-tools"}, "product_version": "2.1.0, < 2.20.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16e34445-4c4c-3535-8f45-b1c050afc493", "vendor": {"name": "prisma"}}], "isExploited": false}
