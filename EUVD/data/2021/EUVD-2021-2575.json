Versions of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email addresses that are no longer valid that will print information about any affected orders that exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option, a workaround is available. It is possible to edit the file `config/application.rb` manually (with code provided by the maintainers in the GitHub Security Advisory) to check email validity.", "datePublished": "2021-12-07T17:25:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:03:08", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/security/advisories/GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43805", "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/6be174c955fad84017ca67589c676526bc5ade71", "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/commit/9867153e01e3c3b898cdbcedd7b43375ea922401", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/solidus_core/CVE-2021-43805.yml", "https://github.com/solidusio/solidus"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43805", "GHSA-qxmr-qxh6-2cc9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "500baee3-1db8-301e-bf2f-c1b0ba5fb0d4", "product": {"name": "solidus"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.0.4"}, {"id": "8796cd46-0659-3aa2-af24-1a73032b3381", "product": {"name": "solidus"}, "product_version": "3.1.0, < 3.1.4"}, {"id": "cacf923b-4d6e-3644-8f2d-77be822b8475", "product": {"name": "solidus"}, "product_version": "< 2.11.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "93b937b4-ac35-3a1d-b852-c41ee13f099f", "vendor": {"name": "solidusio"}}], "isExploited": false}
