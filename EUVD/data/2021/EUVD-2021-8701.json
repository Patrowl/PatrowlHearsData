An out-of-bounds read can be triggered by 6LoWPAN packets sent to devices running Contiki-NG 4.6 and prior. The IPv6 header decompression function (<code>uncompress_hdr_iphc</code>) does not perform proper boundary checks when reading from the packet buffer. Hence, it is possible to construct a compressed 6LoWPAN packet that will read more bytes than what is available from the packet buffer. As of time of publication, there is not a release with a patch available. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-band as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2021-06-18T21:00:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:16", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-hhwj-2p59-v8p9", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1482"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21410"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6aa7d89a-7070-3970-8451-ccf377bd648f", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87282022-7297-3ec3-abcb-cbd60df53d27", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
