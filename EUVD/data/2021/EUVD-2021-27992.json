When user clicks on a specially crafted a malicious URL, if user does not carefully pay attention to url, user may be tricked to think content may be coming from a valid domain, while it comes from another. This is performed by using a very long username part of the url so that user cannot see the domain name. A remote attacker can leverage this to perform url address bar spoofing attack. The fix is, browser no longer shows the user name part in address bar.", "datePublished": "2021-12-16T10:58:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:51:07", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.f-secure.com/en/business/programs/vulnerability-reward-program/hall-of-fame", "https://www.f-secure.com/en/business/support-and-downloads/security-advisories"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40835"], "assigner": "F-SecureUS", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e43aa142-ea16-300c-8203-c4cb16e54a08", "product": {"name": "F-Secure Mobile Security"}, "product_version": "18.3 <18.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1695cf04-1bcd-3675-9b84-1eba64f22b5b", "vendor": {"name": "F-Secure"}}], "isExploited": false}
