This vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against brute forcing of the host key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit would require the attacker to have access to join a Webex meeting, including applicable meeting join links and passwords. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire or take over the host role for a meeting.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:46:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:39:39", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-brutef-hostkey-FWRMxVF"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1311"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7cca3410-0d1e-3f35-a9ae-f641b22a123e", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8a22abe-c683-362d-8461-b7f739e2040e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
