Such kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free in Linux netback when the backend is destroyed, as the kernel thread associated with queue 0 will have already exited and thus the call to kthread_stop will be performed against a stale pointer.", "datePublished": "2021-06-29T11:30:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28691.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-28691", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-28691.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-374.txt", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210805-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28691"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3263797c-fecc-3ef7-8d71-5c2b06291ad9", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.5.0 <unspecified"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94350fa9-db62-340a-911b-77031a54cbfd", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
