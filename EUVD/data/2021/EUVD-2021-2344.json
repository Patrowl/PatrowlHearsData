They are stored in a directory with a random name, but it's possible to stall the uploads and brute force the directory name. You have to be an admin with the ability to upload files, but this bug gives you the ability to upload restricted file types and execute them depending on server configuration.To fix this, a check for allowed file extensions was added before downloading files to a tmp directory.Concrete CMS Security Team gave this a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.4 AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:NThis fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0", "datePublished": "2021-11-19T18:11:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:58:25", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22968", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1350444", "https://documentation.concretecms.org/developers/introduction/version-history/857-release-notes", "https://github.com/olsgreen/concrete5-core"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22968", "GHSA-g3p2-hfqr-9m25"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 2.66, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f21c0d7a-da0e-3c98-856c-aa5278b236d6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
