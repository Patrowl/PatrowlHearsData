On start-up, the Enterprise Vault application starts several services that listen on random .NET Remoting TCP ports for possible commands from client applications. These TCP services can be exploited due to deserialization behavior that is inherent to the .NET Remoting service. A malicious attacker can exploit both TCP remoting services and local IPC services on the Enterprise Vault Server. This vulnerability is mitigated by properly configuring the servers and firewall as described in the vendor's security alert for this vulnerability (VTS21-003, ZDI-CAN-14079).", "datePublished": "2021-12-06T21:56:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:25:16", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:U/UI:N", "references": ["https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS21-003", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-1593/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-44682"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d052c015-8493-3463-aa58-621a39076f49", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ab73bf55-193a-38be-ba3f-13535483d7d1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
