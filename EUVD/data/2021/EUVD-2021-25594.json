The Nextcloud Contacts application prior to version 4.0.3 was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Contacts application is upgraded to 4.0.3. As a workaround, one may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.", "datePublished": "2021-10-25T19:05:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-j6cx-mxqf-f9vc", "https://github.com/nextcloud/contacts/pull/2407"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39221"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "86fc7184-1c8c-3f5f-b784-f7fd2cdaf4fa", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7074951b-b9cb-369c-b346-ab5f77c262ed", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
