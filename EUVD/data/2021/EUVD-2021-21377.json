This vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when an affected device processes traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges, or cause the device to reload, which could result in a denial of service condition.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:26:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:58:32", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxesdwan-rbuffover-vE2OB6tp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34727"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "80a6b030-50a1-3319-b99c-6d64615f76ca", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a334a0a-76f6-3de3-b167-7588a6efac81", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
