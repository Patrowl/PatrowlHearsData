This vulnerability is due to incorrect LPTS programming when using SNMP with management plane protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using SNMP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect to the device on the configured SNMP ports. Valid credentials are required to execute any of the SNMP requests.", "datePublished": "2021-02-04T16:35:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:53:36", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snmp-7MKrW7Nq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1243"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5452b998-5d03-3fa8-a261-2cb17754466f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "280fc53b-f107-3c86-adad-a50e68480ec0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
