This design is vulnerable to being exploited remotely through a DNS rebinding attack or a drive-by download of a carefully crafted exploit.", "datePublished": "2020-03-10T14:30:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:47:13", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17636", "https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/7205", "https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/commit/b212d07f915df1509180944ee3132714bc2636bf", "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=551747"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-17636", "GHSA-f7vx-j8mp-3h2x"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07c20bf8-033a-3247-9eb7-dd94493fd626", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Theia"}, "product_version": "0.3.9 to 0.15.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71a0ee7c-0522-3eff-9242-e92810a2983d", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
