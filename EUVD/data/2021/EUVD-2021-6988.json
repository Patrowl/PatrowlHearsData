This vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected IP camera to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2021-05-06T12:51:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:16:10", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcameras-dos-fc3F6LzT"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1521"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aaedefb6-01b7-312f-973a-114622fc6120", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af1b5c3f-03a7-380c-8015-a36a409b1bc1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
