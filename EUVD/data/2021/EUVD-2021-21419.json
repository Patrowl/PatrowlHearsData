These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:26:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:52:41", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-capwap-dos-gmNjdKOY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34769"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ea8eb5e-0021-3e65-ba0c-332120819953", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bf430c69-fac9-38ef-a95e-303813063488", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
