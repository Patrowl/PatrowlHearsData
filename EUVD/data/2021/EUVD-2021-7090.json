This vulnerability is due to the punt path being overwhelmed by large quantities of SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of SNMP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overload the device punt path, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:25:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:59:51", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cbr8snmp-zGjkZ9Fc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1623"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cdbc6aa4-6c72-3dfe-bcda-00ef5d911ea1", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70438a57-5ed1-3e08-a3b4-42f016873054", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
