The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-03-18T18:35:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:36:46", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-132w134w-overflow-Pptt4H2p"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1287"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a7b0d01d-b7d8-3383-84dd-85b6f0dec873", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d18b6143-ea6e-39ac-bfde-a8229dc55725", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
