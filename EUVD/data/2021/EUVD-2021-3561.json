The end result is that via an ioctl an untrusted app can control the ui32PageIndex offset in the expression:sPA.uiAddr = page_to_phys(psOSPageArrayData->pagearray[ui32PageIndex]);With the current PoC this crashes as an OOB read. However, given that the OOB read value is ending up as the address field of a struct I think i seems plausible that this could lead to an OOB write if the attacker is able to cause the OOB read to pull an interesting kernel address. Regardless if this is a read or write, it is a High severity issue in the kernel.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID: A-238904312", "datePublished": "2022-09-13T19:13:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T15:55:17", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2022-09-01"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-0942"], "assigner": "google_android", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c2cc67a4-c17a-34b6-9127-7c36efb9491f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
