This vulnerability occurs because the device does not properly validate URIs in IOx API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:07:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T17:54:50", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-pt-hWGcPf7g", "https://github.com/orangecertcc/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-hhfw-6cm2-v3w5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1385"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b76a22ce-61e9-30f5-ae16-7b331e26de38", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d47f2855-91b8-3774-a79e-4809606c59d8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
