An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the image ICC profile, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p C`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.", "datePublished": "2021-08-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:23:01", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-37618.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4319", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4173", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-37618", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-37618.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-37618", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-37618.html", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-583f-w9pm-99r2", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1759", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMDT4PJB7P43WSOM3TRQIY3J33BAFVVE/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UYGDELIFFJWKUU7SO3QATCIXCZJERGAC/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37618"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "803ad7b5-7c31-3332-b6b5-609547ac40ec", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.27.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "24ffc615-02ab-3b0e-8c6c-eb2a30007f79", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
