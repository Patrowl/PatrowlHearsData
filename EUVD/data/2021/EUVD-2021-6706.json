The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:17:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:47:56", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-stored-xss-djKfCzf2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1239"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dccea2c3-602d-3a0e-a0b7-bb61ad58d758", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8244762c-317c-34e5-b008-f172f1e0286e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
