In crossbeam-channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.", "datePublished": "2020-10-16T17:05:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:23", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/security/advisories/GHSA-v5m7-53cv-f3hx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15254", "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/539", "https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/pull/425", "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/533", "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2020-0052.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15254.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-15254", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-15254"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15254", "GHSA-v5m7-53cv-f3hx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6ab8a2df-cbd1-3cd6-a78f-0c724924f1d9", "product": {"name": "crossbeam"}, "product_version": "< 0.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8017bf17-5f77-3ff4-bb44-2f57b4ad7222", "vendor": {"name": "crossbeam-rs"}}], "isExploited": false}
