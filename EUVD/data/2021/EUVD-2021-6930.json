This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-04-08T04:06:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:27:11", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cuic-xss-U2WTsUg6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1463"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "37884c22-2f3f-385d-a1d3-a1d029373361", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd086f90-6beb-35e8-86ba-073d3fe6267a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
