This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input on specific REST API commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid low-privileged user credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-07-22T15:20:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:05:16", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fdm-rce-Rx6vVurq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1518"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "37c46e86-eacc-368b-8942-3d7b05e8c997", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7370fef6-e594-38fc-a966-26a9351efdd6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
