This will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken. In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger, then heap overflow will occur.", "datePublished": "2021-07-19T14:24:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:30:07", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-30"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20109"], "assigner": "tenable", "epss": 2.79, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "91a341d9-bec9-3d11-a9e8-592a7ac19cc1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
