In `evm` crate `< 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However, according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the destination validity check. This is a **high** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum mainnet. In this case, you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after `0.31.0`. This is a **low** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate in Frontier or in a standalone blockchain, because there's no security exploit possible with this advisory. It is **not** recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal chain upgrade preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain, please ensure to update your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains, please make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this.", "datePublished": "2021-10-18T21:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-pvh2-pj76-4m96", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41153", "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/67", "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41153", "GHSA-pvh2-pj76-4m96"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b0dd7d18-2d2e-34c8-8633-649a9c722511", "product": {"name": "evm"}, "product_version": "< 0.31.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "24cec777-ff26-33ec-a48a-39c429b6a687", "vendor": {"name": "rust-blockchain"}}], "isExploited": false}
