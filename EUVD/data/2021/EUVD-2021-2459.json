This may happen naturally if you start a network, have it run for some time and restart it (**without changing chainID**). A malicious block proposer (even with a minimal amount of stake) can use this vulnerability to completely halt the network. This issue is fixed in Tendermint 0.33.6 which checks all the signatures are for the block with 2/3+ majority before creating a commit.", "datePublished": "2020-07-02T17:05:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:21", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-6jqj-f58p-mrw3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15091", "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/4926", "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/pull/5426", "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/480b995a31727593f58b361af979054d17d84340", "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint", "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0336", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0090"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15091", "GHSA-6jqj-f58p-mrw3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc281206-3ce2-31a3-80e2-8b10d3718bd3", "product": {"name": "tendermint"}, "product_version": "0.33.0, < 0.33.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ca92b9a-7a7f-31b8-b958-864861b84e13", "vendor": {"name": "tendermint"}}], "isExploited": false}
