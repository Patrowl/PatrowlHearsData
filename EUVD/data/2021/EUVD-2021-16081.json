An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Please see our security policy for information about Exiv2 security.", "datePublished": "2021-04-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29473.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4958", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4173", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-29473", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-29473.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29473", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-7569-phvm-vwc2", "https://github.com/github/advisory-review/pull/1587", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2XQT5F5IINTDYDAFGVGQZ7PMMLG7I5ZZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JWZLDECIXXW3CCZ3RS4A3NG5X5VE4WZM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBKWLTXM7IKZ4PVGKLUQVAVFAYGGF7QR/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2A5GMJEXQ5Q76JK6F6VKK5JYCLVFGKN/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/08/msg00028.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29473"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6ecb1825-80e5-36cc-b5cf-bae4169c6cfe", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "< 0.27.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7e8753bd-7217-395f-9252-38459193afe0", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
