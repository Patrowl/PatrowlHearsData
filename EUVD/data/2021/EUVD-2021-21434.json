This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T15:40:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:42:48", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pi-epnm-xss-U2JK537j"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34784"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a6f0329b-ba78-3a4b-aca8-06af7a79831d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6037a8eb-8df2-3ee2-adcd-469f4dd1c10d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
