In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2<sup>n</sup> states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually.", "datePublished": "2021-07-20T16:50:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-qqvp-j6gm-q56f", "https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9447.patch"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32763"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7eb5e3cb-2cac-39d3-8538-e27f5547a149", "product": {"name": "openproject"}, "product_version": "< 11.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ca76842-90fe-3031-bffe-56217ddbd4b9", "vendor": {"name": "opf"}}], "isExploited": false}
