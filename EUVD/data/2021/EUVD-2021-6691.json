The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:16:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:48:38", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5354", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-tfo-bypass-MmzZrtes", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00011.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1224"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e6d90695-dad7-39a0-92d6-3106ab922280", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f1423eb4-18df-324d-888f-47edcaceba4e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
