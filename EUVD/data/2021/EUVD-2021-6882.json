These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device.", "datePublished": "2021-04-08T04:06:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:27:45", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv34x-rce-8bfG2h6b", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-560/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1415"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d5a619c5-31e3-3839-9323-e2eebf66aa24", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ba88af4b-74b5-3737-9658-a5398695568d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
