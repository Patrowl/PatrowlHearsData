These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient error handling in the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web UI software to become unresponsive and consume all available vty lines, preventing new session establishment and resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention would be required to regain web UI and vty session functionality. Note: These vulnerabilities do not affect the console connection.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:16:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T03:43:34", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xe-webui-dos-z9yqYQAn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1220"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c182118b-96c2-3d83-8e50-ccbd4ea8fa1a", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b04fb6d-5c65-3870-9383-245730a4628a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
