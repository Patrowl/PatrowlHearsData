The tough library, prior to 0.12.0, does not properly sanitize delegated role names when caching a repository, or when loading a repository from the filesystem. When the repository is cached or loaded, files ending with the .json extension could be overwritten with role metadata anywhere on the system. A fix is available in version 0.12.0. No workarounds to this issue are known.", "datePublished": "2021-10-19T19:55:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/awslabs/tough/security/advisories/GHSA-r56q-vv3c-6g9c", "https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjw6-2cqr-j4qr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41150", "https://github.com/awslabs/tough/commit/1809b9bd1106d78a51fbea3071aa97a3530bac9a", "https://github.com/awslabs/tough"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41150", "GHSA-r56q-vv3c-6g9c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2f9ab7c1-ab5a-322b-96f3-dac5b6b36381", "product": {"name": "tough"}, "product_version": "< 0.12.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bad11f44-aec1-3f57-a6f2-b8b21dacf937", "vendor": {"name": "awslabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
