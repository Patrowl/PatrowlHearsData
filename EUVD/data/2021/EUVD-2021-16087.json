A vulnerability was discovered in SABnzbd that could trick the `filesystem.renamer()` function into writing downloaded files outside the configured Download Folder via malicious PAR2 files. A patch was released as part of SABnzbd 3.2.1RC1. As a workaround, limit downloads to NZBs without PAR2 files, deny write permissions to the SABnzbd process outside areas it must access to perform its job, or update to a fixed version.", "datePublished": "2021-05-07T15:00:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/sabnzbd/sabnzbd/security/advisories/GHSA-jwj3-wrvf-v3rp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29488"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b9397fe1-579f-3799-a91c-a198bcc8c050", "product": {"name": "sabnzbd"}, "product_version": "< 3.2.1"}, {"id": "e9ec03a7-162d-3596-a846-090035e8ff08", "product": {"name": "sabnzbd"}, "product_version": "< 3.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bbdd6f78-2df2-3df8-873a-65c9154b392c", "vendor": {"name": "sabnzbd"}}], "isExploited": false}
