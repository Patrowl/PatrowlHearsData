These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading an interface user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-04-08T04:06:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:28:29", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-xss-Q4PZcNzJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1408"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a109394a-6eb9-39a7-b253-f152bac76358", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "028be5c4-25f1-3f09-8c81-952ab83ad73b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
