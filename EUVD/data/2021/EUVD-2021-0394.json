In affected versions an attacker can cause denial of service in applications serving models using `tf.raw_ops.UnravelIndex` by triggering a division by 0. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/unravel_index_op.cc#L36) does not check that the tensor subsumed by `dims` is not empty. Hence, if one element of `dims` is 0, the implementation does a division by 0. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit a776040a5e7ebf76eeb7eb923bf1ae417dd4d233. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "datePublished": "2021-08-12T23:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:45", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a776040a5e7ebf76eeb7eb923bf1ae417dd4d233", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-2wmv-37vq-52g5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37668", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2021-581.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2021-779.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2021-290.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-37668.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-37668"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37668", "GHSA-2wmv-37vq-52g5", "PYSEC-2021-581"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3c748196-4efa-3a38-a013-e7956deced07", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.4.0, < 2.4.3"}, {"id": "5c3357df-40d0-3dcf-a094-628ba0dd0d6f", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.5.0, < 2.5.1"}, {"id": "899bb2ca-f626-32ae-9dcb-17f58212f055", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.3.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2d461d4f-8020-3fad-ad31-810b44b61821", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
