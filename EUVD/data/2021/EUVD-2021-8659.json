In Wire for iOS (iPhone and iPad) before version 3.75 there is a vulnerability where the video capture isn't stopped in a scenario where a user first has their camera enabled and then disables it. It's a privacy issue because video is streamed to the call when the user believes it is disabled. It impacts all users in video calls. This is fixed in version 3.75.", "datePublished": "2021-02-11T18:05:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-7fg4-x8vj-qvxf", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/pull/4879", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios/commit/7e3c30120066c9b10e50cc0d20012d0849c33a40"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21301"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8535530e-263b-32d2-acb0-ebb8dc5283c4", "product": {"name": "wire-ios"}, "product_version": "< 3.75"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d956d303-d7f6-374b-a004-a6ed2857afae", "vendor": {"name": "wireapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
