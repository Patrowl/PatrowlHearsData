This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to an API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific API request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application.", "datePublished": "2021-08-04T17:20:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:04:19", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-epnm-info-disc-PjTZ5r6C"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34707"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ce2cbeb5-c8ec-35f7-83b1-b091fa3c6575", "product": {"name": "Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6b93b043-bf3c-3ae6-adc8-26b595526edd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
