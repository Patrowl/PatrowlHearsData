In affected versions it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying an IPv6 address prefix in the RPL-Classic implementation in Contiki-NG. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the Contiki-NG system must have joined an RPL DODAG. After that, an attacker can send a DAO packet with a Target option that contains a prefix length larger than 128 bits. The problem was fixed after the release of Contiki-NG 4.7. Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1615.", "datePublished": "2022-08-04T20:25:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:53:33", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-jqjf-v7v9-xp6w", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1615", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1615/commits/587ae59956e00316fd44fd7072ac3a6a07b4b20f", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/releases/tag/release%2Fv4.8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32771"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f7c0320e-340c-380a-982e-cbc514303a8d", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7910078c-5fc2-3a47-8a30-b10bbb1b0966", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
