Example of different renders: image, audio, video, etc. As an example of type 1 attack, an unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field of a document may use a payload with embedded javascript. This could send an export of a collection to the attacker without even an admin knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping a database\\collection are possible.", "datePublished": "2021-06-21T18:45:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:16", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8h-86p5-wv3p", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21422", "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577", "https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/commit/f5e0d4931f856f032f22664b5e5901d5950cfd4b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21422", "GHSA-7p8h-86p5-wv3p"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "508292c4-5c95-3c0b-a776-9d401a0c8d29", "product": {"name": "mongo-express"}, "product_version": "< v1.0.0-alpha.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7e119875-565d-3035-a862-9c5195569db7", "vendor": {"name": "mongo-express"}}], "isExploited": false}
