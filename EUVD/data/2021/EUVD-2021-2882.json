{"id": "EUVD-2021-2882", "enisaUuid": "d1632ec5-ce39-3ddd-b332-4926e318bf4b", "description": "A Data Processing vulnerability in the Multi-Service process (multi-svcs) on the FPC of Juniper Networks Junos OS on the PTX Series routers may lead to the process becoming unresponsive, ultimately affecting traffic forwarding, allowing an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition . The Multi-Service Process running on the FPC is responsible for handling sampling-related operations when a J-Flow configuration is activated. This can occur during periods of heavy route churn, causing the Multi-Service Process to stop processing updates, without consuming any further updates from kernel. This back pressure towards the kernel affects further dynamic updates from other processes in the system, including RPD, causing a KRT-STUCK condition and traffic forwarding issues. An administrator can monitor the following command to check if there is the KRT queue is stuck: user@device > show krt state ... Number of async queue entries: 65007 <--- this value keep on increasing. The following logs/alarms will be observed when this condition exists: user@junos> show chassis alarms 2 alarms currently active Alarm time Class Description 2020-10-11 04:33:45 PDT Minor Potential slow peers are: MSP(FPC1-PIC0) MSP(FPC3-PIC0) MSP(FPC4-PIC0) Logs: Oct 11 04:33:44.672 2020 test /kernel: rts_peer_cp_recv_timeout : Bit set for msp8 as it is stuck Oct 11 04:35:56.000 2020 test-lab fpc4 user.err gldfpc-multi-svcs.elf: Error in parsing composite nexthop Oct 11 04:35:56.000 2020 test-lab fpc4 user.err gldfpc-multi-svcs.elf: composite nexthop parsing error Oct 11 04:43:05 2020 test /kernel: rt_pfe_veto: Possible slowest client is msp38.
