During installation of OpenShift Container Platform 4 clusters, bootstrap nodes are provisioned with anonymous authentication enabled on kubelet port 10250. A remote attacker able to reach this port during installation can make unauthenticated `/exec` requests to execute arbitrary commands within running containers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.", "datePublished": "2021-02-23T17:45:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:30:07", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0313", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0308", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1920764"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20198"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "43e54137-f74b-34f2-a22b-ef61c882f636", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
