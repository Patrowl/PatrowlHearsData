There is a persistent XSS vulnerability in the file-upload functionality for uploading icons when attempting to create new Apps. An attacker with minimal privileges in the application can build their own App and upload a malicious file containing an XSS payload, by uploading an arbitrary file and modifying the MIME type in a subsequent HTTP request. This then allows the file to be stored and retrieved from the server by other users in the same organization.", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T17:50:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:10:17", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/uipath-assistant", "https://docs.uipath.com/apps/v2021.10/docs/2021-10-1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-44043"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f286e7a1-bfef-3e23-91c3-f8ab912985e4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "79530182-d3cb-3d8a-abdd-4e219b86b7f9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
