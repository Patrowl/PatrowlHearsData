These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into the web-based management interface and persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. An attacker needs valid administrator credentials to inject the malicious script code.", "datePublished": "2021-05-22T06:40:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:15:25", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-finesse-strd-xss-bUKqffFW"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1254"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "57da8917-b6ac-3d74-9b4a-8c7304c8d446", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac3d50c3-2011-39a4-9f83-19fc17ee0c3e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
