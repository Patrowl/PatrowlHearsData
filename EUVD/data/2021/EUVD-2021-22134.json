This is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the Virtual Host Monitoring section by requesting random virtual-host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. (Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.)", "datePublished": "2021-10-05T15:12:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T00:40:46", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.gruppotim.it/redteam", "https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-engine-4-8-14-release-notes", "https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/wowza-streaming-engine-i/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-35492"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 12.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "09a515a5-31a9-3000-bc19-a71e07d32cd1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "63283420-365b-30ce-86fd-cbd31c1d72b3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
