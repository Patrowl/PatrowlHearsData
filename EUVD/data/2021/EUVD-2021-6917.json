To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending one or more crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect process on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to stop the AnyConnect process, causing a DoS condition on the device. Note: The process under attack will automatically restart so no action is needed by the user or admin.", "datePublished": "2021-02-24T19:31:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:36:55", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-dos-55AYyxYr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1450"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1dc7bfd5-ee41-3765-a7a6-e4617bcace28", "product": {"name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "37b5895c-97d1-3eb1-b8c9-a600399ae00a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
