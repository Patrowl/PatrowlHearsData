Opencast versions prior to 9.10 allow HTTP method spoofing, allowing to change the assumed HTTP method via URL parameter. This allows attackers to turn HTTP GET requests into PUT requests or an HTTP form to send DELETE requests. This bypasses restrictions otherwise put on these types of requests and aids in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not be possible. The vulnerability allows attackers to craft links or forms which may change the server state. This issue is fixed in Opencast 9.10 and 10.0. You can mitigate the problem by setting the `SameSite=Strict` attribute for your cookies. If this is a viable option for you depends on your integrations. We strongly recommend updating in any case.", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T18:10:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:03:08", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-j4mm-7pj3-jf7v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43807", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/59cb6731067283e54f15462be38b6117d8b9ea8b#diff-9c5fb3d1b7e3b0f54bc5c4182965c4fe1f9023d449017cece3005d3f90e8e4d8", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8f8271e1085f6f8e306c689d6a56b0bb8d076444", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43807", "GHSA-j4mm-7pj3-jf7v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "32b3cedf-7744-341c-a58e-a18ea590e0a2", "product": {"name": "opencast"}, "product_version": "< 9.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f829c049-e9ec-3ddc-95e4-711ff118c055", "vendor": {"name": "opencast"}}], "isExploited": false}
