Before version 2.106.0, the CORS ` Access-Control-Allow-Origin ` header set by `nginz` is set for all subdomains of `.wire.com` (including `wire.com`). This means that if somebody were to find an XSS vector in any of the subdomains, they could use it to talk to the Wire API using the user's Cookie. A patch does not exist, but a workaround does. To make sure that a compromise of one subdomain does not yield access to the cookie of another, one may limit the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to apps that actually require the cookie (account-pages, team-settings and the webapp).", "datePublished": "2021-09-30T19:20:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-v7xx-cx8m-g66p"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41101"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea74cb34-60b4-3139-bc64-9e0dd2ce8719", "product": {"name": "wire-server"}, "product_version": "< 2.106.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d1865ba9-03aa-364d-b7db-4c842f813f87", "vendor": {"name": "wireapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
