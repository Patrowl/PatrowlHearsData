The vulnerability is due to incorrect boundary checks of certain values in Easy VSS protocol packets that are destined for an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Easy VSS protocol packets to UDP port 5500 while the affected device is in a specific state. When the crafted packet is processed, a buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:06:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:34:39", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-xe-evss-code-exe-8cw5VSvw"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1451"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8d0ddc40-e0bc-3889-a9cc-2d35aed674d7", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e114f937-7dbb-3685-8f6e-007cc06afeb1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
