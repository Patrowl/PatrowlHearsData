Between versions 2.3.0 and 2.8.2, the `doc` module of Icinga Web 2 allows to view documentation directly in the UI. It must be enabled manually by an administrator and users need explicit access permission to use it. Then, by visiting a certain route, it is possible to gain access to arbitrary files readable by the web-server user. The issue has been fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, an administrator may disable the `doc` module or revoke permission to use it from all users.", "datePublished": "2021-07-12T22:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:54", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32746.html", "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43", "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.7.5", "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.8.3", "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/releases/tag/v2.9.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32746"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fe1bec9b-712b-33c9-bc62-e872036c1642", "product": {"name": "icingaweb2"}, "product_version": "2.3.0, \u2264 2.8.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff9c02fb-6173-320e-bdea-18a1a11f8f42", "vendor": {"name": "Icinga"}}], "isExploited": false}
