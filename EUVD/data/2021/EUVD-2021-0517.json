It is possible to systematically emulate tracking cookies per contact due to tracking the contact by their auto-incremented ID. Thus, a third party can manipulate the cookie value with +1 to systematically assume being tracked as each contact in Mautic. It is then possible to retrieve information about the contact through forms that have progressive profiling enabled.", "datePublished": "2018-04-17T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T00:31:14", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-vfxj-qg93-7wwc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-10189", "https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/2.13.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-10189", "GHSA-vfxj-qg93-7wwc"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "125590c4-f0ea-3240-acc3-3a90ba02aeb4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d1096e2-c94c-3250-9009-37a4d7138319", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
