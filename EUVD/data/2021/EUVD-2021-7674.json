A remote, unauthenticated attacker who sends a crafted request to the zeromq server could trigger a buffer overflow WRITE of arbitrary data if CURVE/ZAP authentication is not enabled. The greatest impact of this flaw is to application availability, data integrity, and confidentiality.", "datePublished": "2021-04-01T13:47:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:37:22", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-20235.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-20235", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1921983", "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/security/advisories/GHSA-fc3w-qxf5-7hp6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20235"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 9.49, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d38ae45c-c50b-3bb8-a3c0-833351fd578f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
