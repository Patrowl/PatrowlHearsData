In Admidio before version 4.0.4, there is an authenticated RCE via .phar file upload. A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc). The vulnerability is patched in version 4.0.4.", "datePublished": "2021-05-20T16:45:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:30", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/security/advisories/GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2", "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/issues/994", "https://github.com/Admidio/admidio/releases/tag/v4.0.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32630"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "613084f7-be03-3966-ae5a-873b5c191771", "product": {"name": "admidio"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f34317c3-8a59-32a3-a598-92a8bcbf7a76", "vendor": {"name": "Admidio"}}], "isExploited": false}
