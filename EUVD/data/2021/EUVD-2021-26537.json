When using federated identity management (authenticating via SAML through a third-party identity provider), an attacker can inject additional data into a signed SAML response being transmitted to the service provider (ID Bravura Security Fabric). The application successfully validates the signed values but uses the unsigned malicious values. An attacker with lower-privilege access to the application can inject the username of a high-privilege user to impersonate that user.", "datePublished": "2021-06-09T14:10:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T16:45:51", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:L/S:U/UI:N", "references": ["https://www.hitachi.com/hirt/security/index.html", "https://www.hitachi.com/hirt/hitachi-sec/2021/601.html", "https://www.hitachi-id.com/cve-2021-3196-attackers-can-impersonate-another-user"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3196"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e5b21f18-4402-35c3-92e5-da8973d24337", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "56b2512b-9c49-34c4-a440-183582211b6a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
