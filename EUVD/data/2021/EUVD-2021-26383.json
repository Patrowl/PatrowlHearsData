This leaks a small amount of random information from the firewall memory into the Ethernet packets. An attacker on the same Ethernet subnet as the PAN-OS firewall is able to collect potentially sensitive information from these packets. This issue is also known as Etherleak and is detected by security scanners as CVE-2003-0001. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 version earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.18; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.12; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.5.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T18:10:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T16:48:43", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2021-3031"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3031"], "assigner": "palo_alto", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "11b81ad9-20de-32ce-9576-2f2dee5beaa4", "product": {"name": "PAN-OS"}, "product_version": "9.0 <9.0.12"}, {"id": "52391bfc-a457-359b-b3be-3d5d368a640e", "product": {"name": "PAN-OS"}, "product_version": "9.1 <9.1.5"}, {"id": "e9880df8-d0b5-3db0-836d-d039e64e9e5d", "product": {"name": "PAN-OS"}, "product_version": "8.1 <8.1.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a01f051a-76af-3647-a820-7a475c394f9a", "vendor": {"name": "Palo Alto Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
