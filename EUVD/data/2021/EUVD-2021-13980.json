The Web Interfaces (Admin, Userweb, Sidechannel) can use different methods to perform the authentication of a user. A specific authentication method during login does not check the provided data (when a certain manipulation occurs) and returns OK for any authentication request. This allows an attacker to login to the admin panel as a user of his choice, e.g., the root user (with highest privileges) or even a non-existing user.", "datePublished": "2021-03-03T15:45:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T20:40:47", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.genua.de/en/it-security-solutions/high-resistance-firewall-genugate", "https://kunde.genua.de/en/overview/genugate.html", "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/authentication-bypass-genua-genugate/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-27215"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "da34a5f1-9539-3d47-90a7-a1328bde7c5e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c81ed606-2a5c-3c90-9075-4171f478892e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
