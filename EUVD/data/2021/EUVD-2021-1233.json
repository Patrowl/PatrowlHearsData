The attack requires a victim to be logged into a Rancher server, and then to access a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute commands against the cluster's Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of the victim.", "datePublished": "2019-09-04T13:40:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:41:10", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13209", "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/commit/0ddffe484adccb9e37d9432e8e625d8ebbfb0088", "https://forums.rancher.com/t/rancher-release-v2-2-5-addresses-rancher-cve-2019-13209/14801", "https://github.com/rancher/rancher", "https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13209", "GHSA-xhg2-rvm8-w2jh"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "371671d2-933c-3642-a48a-e1675dd51e0b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff7def50-7b39-3bf9-a3e7-c91538b12a4b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
