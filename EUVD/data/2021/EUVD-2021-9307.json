This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set. This affects the netifd and odhcp6c packages.", "datePublished": "2021-02-07T22:56:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:37:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://openwrt.org/advisory/2021-02-02-1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22161"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "59d6d5c0-5926-3bf8-905d-852d44a1f95a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e059e8d9-5b27-3954-8c06-366548f0e876", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
