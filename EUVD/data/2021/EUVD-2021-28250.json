Releases prior to v2022-03-01 are subject to a denial of service attack via a crafted object causing a hash collision. This collision causes the server to spend at least quadratic time parsing it which can lead to a denial of service for a heavily used server. The issue has been fixed in wire-server 2022-03-01 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-03-01, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-04-13T18:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:16:06", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-phxv-pffh-fq2r", "https://cs-syd.eu/posts/2021-09-11-json-vulnerability"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41119"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a12d3b92-545d-3753-ae56-1ebbace36d3f", "product": {"name": "wire-server"}, "product_version": "< v2022-03-01"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ed0bfa60-c269-394a-8843-cce8946b7378", "vendor": {"name": "wireapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
