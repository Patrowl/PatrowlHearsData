These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by using the web-based management interface to upload a file to location on an affected device that they should not have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the file system of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-02-04T16:56:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:43:13", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv160-260-filewrite-7x9mnKjn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1296"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84fdcbde-9110-3d48-bac0-a4492d84dbab", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "24387014-c4dc-3712-8d75-f754974ad850", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
