{"id": "EUVD-2021-6954", "enisaUuid": "fd88b712-206b-3684-b603-ee8ccd0b8a9d", "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) with the permissions of a special non-root user. In this way, an attacker could take control of the affected system, which would allow them to obtain and alter sensitive data. The attacker could also affect the devices that are managed by the affected system by pushing arbitrary configuration files, retrieving device credentials and confidential information, and ultimately undermining the stability of the devices, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2021-05-22T06:45:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T21:14:45", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pi-epnm-cmd-inj-YU5e6tB3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1487"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e7c367df-707e-3026-b678-40dbb4d498ed", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cc9823a3-1c35-38a4-8f64-724224dca2a0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
