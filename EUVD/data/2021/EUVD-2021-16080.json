An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.", "datePublished": "2021-04-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29470.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4173", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-29470", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-29470.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29470", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-8949-hhfh-j7rj", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1581", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2XQT5F5IINTDYDAFGVGQZ7PMMLG7I5ZZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JWZLDECIXXW3CCZ3RS4A3NG5X5VE4WZM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LBKWLTXM7IKZ4PVGKLUQVAVFAYGGF7QR/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/P2A5GMJEXQ5Q76JK6F6VKK5JYCLVFGKN/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29470"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a895f6ea-0920-3be0-8e84-2bd467778d55", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.27.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2407221a-3eab-3de8-9ef7-de07ba3e63a8", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
