This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of arguments that are supplied by the user for a specific file transfer method. An attacker with lower-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by specifying Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) parameters when authenticating to a device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges and retrieve and upload files on a device that they should not have access to.", "datePublished": "2021-09-09T05:00:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:01:03", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-scp-inject-QwZOCv2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34718"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.89, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cde65dbb-fcd6-337e-b6fe-ff67d50585f6", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f7bcaa56-6e2f-3fc9-92c3-f96287b79057", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
