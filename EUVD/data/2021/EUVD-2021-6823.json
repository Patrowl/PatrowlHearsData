These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient error handling in the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web UI software to become unresponsive and consume all available vty lines, preventing new session establishment and resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention would be required to regain web UI and vty session functionality. Note: These vulnerabilities do not affect the console connection.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:15:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:31:37", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xe-webui-dos-z9yqYQAn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1356"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4a445aba-e9d9-3d15-ac85-95addd9fe96d", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "73debc9b-3684-376c-81c8-7ce5c456fbf4", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
