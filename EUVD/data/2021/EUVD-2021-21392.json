This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-10-06T19:46:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:48:38", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cvdsd-xss-fvdj6HK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34742"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f2504595-1d4c-32ab-86f3-69a83ba67e7b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "835155d7-1009-37b8-8cec-9c42be8e5593", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
