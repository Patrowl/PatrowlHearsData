A vulnerability in federated share exists in versions prior to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2. An attacker can gain access to basic information about users of a server by accessing a public link that a legitimate server user added as a federated share. This happens because Nextcloud supports sharing registered users with other Nextcloud servers, which can be done automatically when selecting the \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" setting. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2 As a workaround, disable \"Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully\" in the Nextcloud settings.", "datePublished": "2021-06-01T21:45:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32656", "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-j875-vr2q-h6x6", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1167853", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32656"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22b0c0e2-d604-324d-8b87-a03972a096ed", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "20.0.0, < 20.0.10"}, {"id": "237bd90a-2230-372a-a74c-bdb4b1fcd2a9", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 19.0.11"}, {"id": "36c99b3e-4c0a-3598-84fd-228700e68150", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "21.0.0, < 21.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fdaf67bb-b0f6-3620-a6f3-240d85226801", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
