In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version 2.11.1.", "datePublished": "2021-07-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:14", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4999", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-32686.html", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cv8x-p47p-99wr", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/pull/2716", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/d5f95aa066f878b0aef6a64e60b61e8626e664cd", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/releases/tag/2.11.1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32686"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a38eed0c-d4e2-3d6f-aa2b-2e978a21001e", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "< 2.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e5841222-c73c-325b-b2cf-f1dd4c02f83e", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
