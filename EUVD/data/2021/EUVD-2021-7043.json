These vulnerabilities are due to improper authorization enforcement for specific features and for access to log files that contain confidential information. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities either by submitting crafted HTTP messages to an affected system and performing unauthorized actions with the privileges of an administrator, or by retrieving sensitive data from the logs and using it to impersonate a legitimate privileged user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator.", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:35:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:07:11", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bpa-priv-esc-dgubwbH4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1576"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb7800f5-6641-36b6-909e-2d29cd5eeefc", "product": {"name": "Cisco Business Process Automation (BPA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "33b13194-1832-39a0-b170-844b39784c6b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
