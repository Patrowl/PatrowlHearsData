On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.", "datePublished": "2021-06-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:03:33", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-31618.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4937", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-31618.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-31618", "http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/10/9", "https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2021/q2/206", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r14b66ef0f4f569fd515a3f96cd4eb58bd9a8ff525cc326bb0359664f%40%3Ccvs.httpd.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r783b6558abf3305b17ea462bed4bd66d82866438999bf38cef6d11d1%40%3Ccvs.httpd.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2NKJ3ZA3FTSZ2QBBPKS6BYGAWYRABNQQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A73QJ4HPUMU26I6EULG6SCK67TUEXZYR/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/07/msg00006.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-38", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210727-0008/", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/13/2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-31618"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 14.76, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7a389ea7-4179-3a60-ba8c-2855f841f20f", "product": {"name": "Apache HTTP Server"}, "product_version": "2.4.47"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7f5dcc49-38b8-3458-a392-7fc9209aaa9c", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
