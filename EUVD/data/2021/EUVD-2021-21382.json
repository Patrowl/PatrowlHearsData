This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-09-02T03:05:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:01:53", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-prime-collab-xss-fQMDE5GO"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34732"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e06349b0-ae5c-32c9-b06d-6059923dbe81", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9dfada05-36ee-3cbb-962d-f3a8a9461913", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
