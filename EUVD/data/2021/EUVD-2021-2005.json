Prior to version 4.10.4, for regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.", "datePublished": "2021-09-30T15:10:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41109", "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/commit/4ac4b7f71002ed4fbedbb901db1f6ed1e9ac5559", "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server", "https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/releases/tag/4.10.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41109", "GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4486df2d-3f02-3167-bfa6-fbec2df6ab14", "product": {"name": "parse-server"}, "product_version": "< 4.10.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d6475c78-0474-3ccb-8bb5-db21089466a8", "vendor": {"name": "parse-community"}}], "isExploited": false}
