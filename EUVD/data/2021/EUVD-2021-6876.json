These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading an interface user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-04-08T04:06:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:28:19", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-xss-Q4PZcNzJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1409"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17c2b0e0-e446-30a8-91b3-15a137160dc3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de6abd72-507f-378e-83f4-c14481fa105f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
