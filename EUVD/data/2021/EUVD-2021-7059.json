This vulnerability is due to improper resource management for established SSH sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a significant number of SSH sessions on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and restart of internal Cisco UCS Manager software processes and a temporary loss of access to the Cisco UCS Manager CLI and web UI. Note: The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-08-25T19:11:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:01:59", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucs-ssh-dos-MgvmyrQy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1592"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3be73f6c-f14d-3f6a-8629-ee558e8bc4b9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "31359afb-68a2-3c53-bebc-f9a8ea76b540", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
