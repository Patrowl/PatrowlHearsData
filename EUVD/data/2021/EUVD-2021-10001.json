To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization, but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.x prior to 3.0.7 and 2.22.x prior to 2.22.13. It was fixed in versions 3.0.7 and 2.22.13. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.", "datePublished": "2021-05-14T21:10:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:51:07", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.7", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.13", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.7", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.13"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22866"], "assigner": "GitHub_P", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12d1bfad-175d-32cd-a8c5-b5264fbd43b0", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2.22 <2.22.13"}, {"id": "21e0a38b-d36b-3bd1-80c9-7eb3575e6c5b", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "3.0 <3.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de223a83-896b-39fa-9e24-d2cc6588f540", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
