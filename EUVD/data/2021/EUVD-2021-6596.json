The vulnerability exists because a secure authentication token is not required when authenticating to the general purpose API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request for information to the general purpose API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain system and configuration information from the affected device, resulting in an unauthorized information disclosure.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T19:35:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:28:50", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-wsa-sma-info-RHp44vAC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1129"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82bf1828-b646-3168-84d8-aaa50c5e3145", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f028da44-f119-3d98-9c24-09fc1b2a1a9d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
