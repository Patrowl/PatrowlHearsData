This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:15:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:31:47", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-esc-rSNVvTf9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1371"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1799078b-2d8d-337d-ab18-d3ae9e188b49", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "34c805ee-1b90-32dc-9a12-18ca70fb0413", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
