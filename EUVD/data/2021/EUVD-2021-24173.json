A null pointer dereference was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The null pointer dereference is triggered when Exiv2 is used to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the interpreted (translated) data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation that requires an extra command line option (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.", "datePublished": "2021-08-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:23:01", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-37615.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-37615", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-37615.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-37615", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1758", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-h9x9-4f77-336w", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMDT4PJB7P43WSOM3TRQIY3J33BAFVVE/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UYGDELIFFJWKUU7SO3QATCIXCZJERGAC/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37615"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d1c9ad58-6afa-3380-99f4-d2442ee78d39", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.27.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a18562e9-e576-3a0a-bbc7-6b00e5e23653", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
