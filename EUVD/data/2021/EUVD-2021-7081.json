This vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of malformed MPLS packets that are processed by a device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted MPLS packet to an affected device that is running Cisco SD-WAN Software or Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2021-07-22T15:20:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:05:36", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-mpls-infodisclos-MSSRFkZq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1614"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "71df19af-5761-330a-a458-f89b4c0289d8", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "07910ef2-cbaf-3cad-8dc8-48c60e5f9673", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
