An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause through traffic to be dropped. Note: Only products with Snort3 configured and either a rule with Block with Reset or Interactive Block with Reset actions configured are vulnerable. Products configured with Snort2 are not vulnerable.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:56:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:45:31", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-dos-RywH7ezM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40116"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "919bfa62-2c9c-3252-8c42-90d20dbee544", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f634f10-abee-38d4-b0c9-8ce0a07db31f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
