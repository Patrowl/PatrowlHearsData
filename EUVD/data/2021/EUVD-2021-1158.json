The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.", "datePublished": "2021-05-11T16:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-q28m-8xjw-8vr5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29509", "https://gist.github.com/nateberkopec/4b3ea5676c0d70cbb37c82d54be25837", "https://github.com/puma/puma", "https://github.com/puma/puma/security/policy", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/puma/CVE-2021-29509.yml", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00015.html", "https://rubygems.org/gems/puma", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-28", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29509.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4702"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29509", "GHSA-q28m-8xjw-8vr5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b097fec5-bcad-3f92-842a-412cb07ffc02", "product": {"name": "puma"}, "product_version": "< 4.3.8"}, {"id": "e9ad7ace-7416-37ce-82d0-f17b1406f93a", "product": {"name": "puma"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "956775d9-fca9-3740-80f7-eec970b19969", "vendor": {"name": "puma"}}], "isExploited": false}
