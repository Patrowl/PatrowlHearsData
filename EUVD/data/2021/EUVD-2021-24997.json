We assume that the USB splitter supplies power to some speakers. The power indicator LED of the USB splitter is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of the USB splitter's power indicator LED is correlative to its power consumption. The sound played by the connected speakers affects the USB splitter's power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LED. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the USB splitter, we can recover the sound played by the connected speakers.", "datePublished": "2021-08-11T15:24:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:44:23", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nassiben.com/glowworm-attack"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38549"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4f92fe03-cb5c-3034-8aa7-e486dc46fa1d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cf8263af-95af-37db-865c-1ebb4ffcafaa", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
