The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its uninstaller script when being installed to make sure there are no remnants of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4, the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be written by regular users. This could lead to a case where a malicious user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted users to create content in the `C:\\` system folder and verify that there is no malicious `C:\\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T17:25:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:23:01", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-6q2w-v879-q24v", "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/3497", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1240749"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37617"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9ab0cafc-a94e-3f37-96f9-7f86b638b2af", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "3.0.3 , \u2264 3.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5419034d-4ecd-3985-8270-71264cf97496", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
