In affected versions of Pterodactyl a malicious user can trigger a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious website that makes a request to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This requires a targeted attack against a specific Panel instance, and serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked, nor is any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.** This is fixed in version 1.6.3.", "datePublished": "2021-10-25T16:50:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-m49f-hcxp-6hm6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41176", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/45999ba4ee1b2dcb12b4a2fa2cedfb6b5d66fac2", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/tag/v1.6.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41176", "GHSA-m49f-hcxp-6hm6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d04f1cb8-b36f-3ada-9252-7be2ce821a1c", "product": {"name": "panel"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 < 1.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7c472655-4665-3148-9bc1-bd90da61f09b", "vendor": {"name": "pterodactyl"}}], "isExploited": false}
