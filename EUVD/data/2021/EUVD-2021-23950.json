Attackers can access other users' private information such as photos through CSRF. For example: any student's photo information can be accessed through /gmis/(S([1]))/student/grgl/PotoImageShow/?bh=[2]. Among them, the code in [1] is a random string generated according to the user's login related information. It can protect the user's identity, but it can not effectively prevent unauthorized access. The code in [2] is the student number of any student. The attacker can carry out CSRF attack on the system by modifying [2] without modifying [1].", "datePublished": "2021-08-06T12:52:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:16:03", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/caiteli/poc_information/blob/main/southsoft_GMIS.txt", "https://github.com/caiteli/poc_information/issues/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37381"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34292057-83c5-3a83-8f7b-052c6cef8d8e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "138ac35a-3f5f-3c8a-bf70-e0ece1327fd9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
