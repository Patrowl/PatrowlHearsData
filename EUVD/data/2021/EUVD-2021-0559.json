Node-RED 1.2.7 and earlier has a vulnerability which allows arbitrary path traversal via the Projects API. If the Projects feature is enabled, a user with `projects.read` permission is able to access any file via the Projects API. The issue has been patched in Node-RED 1.2.8. The vulnerability applies only to the Projects feature which is not enabled by default in Node-RED. The primary workaround is not give untrusted users read access to the Node-RED editor.", "datePublished": "2021-02-26T16:25:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/node-red/node-red/security/advisories/GHSA-m33v-338h-4v9f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21298", "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/commit/74db3e17d075f23d9c95d7871586cf461524c456", "https://github.com/node-red/node-red/releases/tag/1.2.8", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@node-red/runtime", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40node-red/runtime"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21298", "GHSA-m33v-338h-4v9f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4ac454b-21b5-3e4c-84da-c881877ddb0f", "product": {"name": "node-red"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f2ec1bf-95b1-3b50-84ee-0e5070ff1279", "vendor": {"name": "node-red"}}], "isExploited": false}
