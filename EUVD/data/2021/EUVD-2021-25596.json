The Nextcloud Richdocuments application prior to versions 3.8.6 and 4.2.3 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`).

As a workaround, disable the Richdocuments application in the app settings.", "datePublished": "2021-10-25T21:35:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-rjcc-4cgj-6v93", "https://github.com/nextcloud/richdocuments/pull/1760", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1253460"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39223"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d251b4a-b265-3f41-8d46-4e4be2881f93", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.2.3"}, {"id": "b8895ee2-0d79-3750-bfe9-e13064ba9cc1", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 3.8.6,"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9a146bf8-60e9-3dba-9331-a10aac601da5", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
