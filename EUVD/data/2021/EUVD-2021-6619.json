The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:37:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:41:37", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-LPTQ3EQC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1152"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1501de80-a493-31f5-8688-2cbd3673d941", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec023743-6c94-3ca2-a57b-7fba78a4f018", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
