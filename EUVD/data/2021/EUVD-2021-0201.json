In Products.PluggableAuthService before version 2.6.0 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to the login form and login functionality could redirect the browser to a different website. The problem has been fixed in version 2.6.1. Depending on how you have installed Products.PluggableAuthService, you should change the buildout version pin to `2.6.1` and re-run the buildout, or if you used `pip` simply do `pip install \\\"Products.PluggableAuthService>=2.6.1\\\".", "datePublished": "2021-03-08T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-03-12T13:48:00", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.PluggableAuthService/security/advisories/GHSA-p44j-xrqg-4xrr", "https://pypi.org/project/Products.PluggableAuthService/", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Products.PluggableAuthService/commit/7eead067898852ebd3e0f143bc51295928528dfa", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21337", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/products-pluggableauthservice/PYSEC-2021-45.yaml", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162911/Products.PluggableAuthService-2.6.0-Open-Redirect.html", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2021-21337"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21337", "GHSA-p44j-xrqg-4xrr", "PYSEC-2021-45"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.8, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "20acd6ee-151b-35dc-a9b8-12ee0dc6d5bd", "product": {"name": "Products.PluggableAuthService"}, "product_version": "< 2.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2fded07e-02dd-3e0e-977c-99b4edfb7b06", "vendor": {"name": "zopefoundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
