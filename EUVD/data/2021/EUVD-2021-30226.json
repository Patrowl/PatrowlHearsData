The default Wi-Fi WPA2 key is advertised to anyone within Wi-Fi range through the router's MAC address. The device default Wi-Fi password corresponds to the last 4 bytes of the MAC address of its 2.4 GHz network interface controller (NIC). An attacker within scanning range of the Wi-Fi network can thus scan for Wi-Fi networks to obtain the default key.", "datePublished": "2021-11-30T18:21:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:55:28", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/?research=Technical+advisories", "https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/12/technical-advisory-multiple-vulnerabilities-in-victure-wr1200-wifi-router-cve-2021-43282-cve-2021-43283-cve-2021-43284/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43282"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7a113d7e-d828-3b3d-86b9-d26e2d78a47f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "92010143-fd3e-314f-beb3-4046eb1162bf", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
