In versions prior to 3.11.4 the AES_CBC_HMAC_SHA2 Algorithm (A128CBC-HS256, A192CBC-HS384, A256CBC-HS512) decryption would always execute both HMAC tag verification and CBC decryption, if either failed `JWEDecryptionFailed` would be thrown. But a possibly observable difference in timing when padding error would occur while decrypting the ciphertext makes a padding oracle and an adversary might be able to make use of that oracle to decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block). A patch was released which ensures the HMAC tag is verified before performing CBC decryption. The fixed versions are `>=3.11.4`. Users should upgrade to `^3.11.4`.", "datePublished": "2021-04-16T22:00:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:02:51", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/panva/jose/security/advisories/GHSA-rvcw-f68w-8h8h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29446", "https://github.com/panva/jose", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose-node-cjs-runtime"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29446", "GHSA-rvcw-f68w-8h8h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a38b1608-691a-3f46-9cd3-91ddd8becdcf", "product": {"name": "jose-node-cjs-runtime"}, "product_version": "< 3.11.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0966a032-1a55-3a37-b12e-bf31da65bab8", "vendor": {"name": "panva"}}], "isExploited": false}
