{"id": "EUVD-2021-7052", "enisaUuid": "91d0fcd0-fe56-3d87-993b-a260ff9b07da", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) Launcher could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a user's operating system. This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper signature verification for specific code exchanged between the ASDM and the Launcher. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position on the network to intercept the traffic between the Launcher and the ASDM and then inject arbitrary code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system with the level of privileges assigned to the ASDM Launcher. A successful exploit may require the attacker to perform a social engineering attack to persuade the user to initiate communication from the Launcher to the ASDM.", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:35:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T02:20:36", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-rce-gqjShXW", "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/08/11/rapid7-discovered-vulnerabilities-in-cisco-asa-asdm-and-firepower-services-software/", "https://github.com/jbaines-r7/staystaystay"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1585"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 53.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "893d2966-7d8e-367e-8d35-dc95fe9fda25", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "caf077fe-1e70-3eac-b89f-ac00850feb54", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
