In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is an issue involving YAML parsing which can lead to post-auth remote code execution. In order to parse and process YAML files, OneDev uses SnakeYaml which by default (when not using `SafeConstructor`) allows the instantiation of arbitrary classes. We can leverage that to run arbitrary code by instantiating classes such as `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and using `URLClassLoader` to load the script engine provider, resulting in the instantiation of a user controlled class. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing certain known classes to be deserialized", "datePublished": "2021-01-15T20:10:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-7xhq-m2q9-6hpm", "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/d6fc4212b1ac1e9bbe3ce444e95f9af1e3ab8b66"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21249"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1494f0db-6c7e-360d-bf1e-888a20335ce9", "product": {"name": "onedev"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d7849ce-d217-38b9-a3c5-8e37e032f0bb", "vendor": {"name": "theonedev"}}], "isExploited": false}
