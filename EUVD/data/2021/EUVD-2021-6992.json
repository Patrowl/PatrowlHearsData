This vulnerability is due to improper validation of URL paths in the application interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a specially crafted URL that is designed to cause Cisco Webex Meetings to include a remote file in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to offer a remote file to a user, which could allow the attacker to conduct further phishing or spoofing attacks.", "datePublished": "2021-06-04T16:45:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:10:12", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-redirect-XuZFU3PH"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1525"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a49cbb28-5725-3774-b47c-9b90f127aeb3", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e0290f9f-5058-3f37-b2a0-d19b9c30281f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
