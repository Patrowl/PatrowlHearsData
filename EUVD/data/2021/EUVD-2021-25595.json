The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.", "datePublished": "2021-11-15T18:30:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-xhxq-f4vg-jw5g", "https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/542", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1135481"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39222"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2519817b-81f0-3a40-b56b-9763c7a4a3f2", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 10.0.7"}, {"id": "6be428e9-2988-3227-b3bf-ccc5a46309c2", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "11.1.0, < 11.1.2"}, {"id": "869860c6-69e0-320b-9069-f367f4941e22", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 11.2.0"}, {"id": "ad2e61ff-18ef-370e-a804-dacd37ad2755", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "10.1.0, < 10.1.4"}, {"id": "bdeaba6e-992f-30ab-b86c-12f4c80129bf", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "12.0.0.alpha-1, < 12.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "56e238e0-f19a-31ca-8ba3-3130841fc0fb", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
