This vulnerability exists because an internal messaging service does not properly sanitize input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the device and then sending a crafted request to the internal service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying OS. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator credentials for the device.", "datePublished": "2021-05-06T12:51:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:16:19", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-34x-privesc-GLN8ZAQE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1520"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d113183-6fbd-3225-b356-9c2776428be2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e6acb8c-f643-302c-a362-e18f87744f33", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
