The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device as a high-privileged user, adding certain configurations with malicious code in one of its fields, and persuading another user to click on it. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:15:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:32:06", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-xss-cAfMtCzv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1374"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4e520b72-c99a-3ff3-a1a4-a1b6bf7c713b", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c2f8c62f-96a4-39df-838d-6bd3b3bca001", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
