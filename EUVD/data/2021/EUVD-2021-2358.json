The parser_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).", "datePublished": "2021-10-29T13:40:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:08:31", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41186", "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/commit/5482a3d049dab351de0be68f4b4bc562319d8511", "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd", "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1142", "https://github.com/github/securitylab-vulnerabilities/blob/52dc4a2a828c6dc24231967c2937ad92038184a9/vendor_reports/GHSL-2021-102-fluent-fluentd.md", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/fluentd/CVE-2021-41186.yml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41186.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41186", "GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d65b6ba6-c1b6-38af-8040-6fc8da58ffd7", "product": {"name": "Fluentd"}, "product_version": "0.14.14, < 1.14.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "10c1d454-97e2-3fb6-917f-1247d94634af", "vendor": {"name": "fluent"}}], "isExploited": false}
