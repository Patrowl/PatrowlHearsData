In versions prior to 1.9.0, a user supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache poisoning of a cache fronting a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache key. Users are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable. This can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location. The vulnerability was patched in Ratpack 1.9.0. As a workaround, ensure that `ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress` correctly configures the server in production.", "datePublished": "2021-06-29T14:35:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack/security/advisories/GHSA-w6rq-6h34-vh7q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29479", "https://github.com/ratpack/ratpack", "https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29479", "GHSA-w6rq-6h34-vh7q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fadee047-4efe-38a0-8877-2c04a5c3ff06", "product": {"name": "ratpack"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d827de54-5208-3bef-aec2-d5617d02040e", "vendor": {"name": "ratpack"}}], "isExploited": false}
