Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account.", "datePublished": "2021-07-12T20:40:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:54", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-5v33-r9cm-7736", "https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/8438", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1189162", "https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption_rfc/blob/7f002996397faefb664019a97ebb0a1e210f64f0/RFC.md#further-devices"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32727"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb7c3d9e-69c9-3fe8-ae04-7247f6dde6bc", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 3.16.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec82fc7d-8ab5-3959-80ef-aa4410518ea0", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
