Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, a malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver. This affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers. Issue is resolved in version 1.25.0. As a workaround the `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.", "datePublished": "2021-02-26T18:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:06", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.25.0", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/ff5c4da1289cb5e097902b3e55b771be342c29d6", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/8950", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-2hwx-mjrm-v3g8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21274", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/matrix-synapse/PYSEC-2021-132.yaml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-21274.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21274", "GHSA-2hwx-mjrm-v3g8", "PYSEC-2021-132"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d69e5b19-6fc2-35a3-b88a-1a1c5a2d3ede", "product": {"name": "synapse"}, "product_version": "0.99.0, < 1.25.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "06461dc8-5850-345e-b339-267269b22fc4", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
