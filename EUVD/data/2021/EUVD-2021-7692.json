The Samba smbd file server must map Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it to read data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative cache entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause the calling code to return those values into the process token that stores the group membership for a user. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.", "datePublished": "2021-05-05T13:36:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:37:23", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-20254.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4866", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4058", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3988", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3724", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3723", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2313", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-20254", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-20254.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-20254", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2021-20254.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-20254.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1949442", "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-20254.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210430-0001/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3EP2VJ73OVBPVSOSTVOMGIEQA3MWF6F7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZAF6L2M6CNAJ2YYYGXPWETTW5YLCWTVT/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-22", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00023.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20254"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b465bfa1-634f-334c-af95-3633c71842f0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
