Prior to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, a file traversal vulnerability makes an attacker able to download arbitrary SVG images from the host system, including user provided files. This could also be leveraged into a XSS/phishing attack, an attacker could upload a malicious SVG file that mimics the Nextcloud login form and send a specially crafted link to victims. The XSS risk here is mitigated due to the fact that Nextcloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy disallowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5 or 22.2.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "datePublished": "2021-10-25T21:55:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41178.html", "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-jp9c-vpr3-m5rf", "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28726", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1302155", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41178"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.87, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ec2382e-c72f-358a-90cb-12dbfb9c154d", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "21.0.0, < 21.0.5"}, {"id": "4013a843-0411-3120-84e1-ef551d5d6f74", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 22.2.0"}, {"id": "77c38f6b-28c9-3ead-bf05-955f68740b6e", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "20.0.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9db9020e-708e-376c-adfa-3cbe5458d516", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
