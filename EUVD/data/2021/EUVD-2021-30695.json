In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2021-12-22T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:25", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-3qx3-cg72-wrh9", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/8b621f192cae14456ee0b0ade52ce6c6f258af1e", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43804"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "151b4a1e-7523-3bff-bd4e-2095a021ea3e", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9fb73be-84dc-397c-bad2-32bce5b689b5", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
