This vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UPnP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T19:40:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:03:55", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-sb-rv-overflow-htpymMB5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34730"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 37.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3e60f3f4-5070-33af-9419-0a1dbdd1fc1a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ca02fbb-8a96-3c5c-96f6-5789abb715f0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
