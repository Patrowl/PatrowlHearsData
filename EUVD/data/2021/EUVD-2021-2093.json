{"id": "EUVD-2021-2093", "enisaUuid": "223abd8c-09a0-3fc5-8347-7cc919b5f469", "description": "Tremor is an event processing system for unstructured data. A vulnerability exists between versions 0.7.2 and 0.11.6. This vulnerability is a memory safety Issue when using `patch` or `merge` on `state` and assign the result back to `state`. In this case, affected versions of Tremor and the tremor-script crate maintains references to memory that might have been freed already. And these memory regions can be accessed by retrieving the `state`, e.g. send it over TCP or HTTP. This requires the Tremor server (or any other program using tremor-script) to execute a tremor-script script that uses the mentioned language construct. The issue has been patched in version 0.11.6 by removing the optimization and always cloning the target expression of a Merge or Patch. If an upgrade is not possible, a possible workaround is to avoid the optimization by introducing a temporary variable and not immediately reassigning to `state`.", "datePublished": "2021-09-17T14:00:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/security/advisories/GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39228", "https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/pull/1217", "https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/commit/1a2efcdbe68e5e7fd0a05836ac32d2cde78a0b2e", "https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime", "https://github.com/tremor-rs/tremor-runtime/releases/tag/v0.11.6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39228", "GHSA-mc22-5q92-8v85"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a583a5b7-f56b-3c65-ac23-d813e2ccdf13", "product": {"name": "tremor-runtime"}, "product_version": "> 0.7.2, < 0.11.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "46dfd1ea-386f-30e2-9870-08cdff20784e", "vendor": {"name": "tremor-rs"}}], "isExploited": false}
