This vulnerability is due to mishandling of the rate limiting feature within the QuantumFlow Processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large amounts of traffic that would be subject to NAT and rate limiting through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the QuantumFlow Processor utilization to reach 100 percent on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:25:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:59:45", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ratenat-pYVLA7wM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1624"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b6331d44-9932-3317-a903-d80cbd88ca84", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bb863ab3-39db-3002-b0d7-56c5ae334e59", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
