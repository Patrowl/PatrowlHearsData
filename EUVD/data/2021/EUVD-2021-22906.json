Symbolic links can be created by any(non-privileged) user under some object directories, but by themselves are not sufficient to successfully escalate privileges. However, combining them with a different object, such as the NTFS junction point allows for the exploitation. Support assist clean files functionality do not distinguish junction points from the physical folder and proceeds to clean the target of the junction that allows nonprivileged users to create junction points and delete arbitrary files on the system which can be accessed only by the admin.", "datePublished": "2021-09-28T19:20:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:25:15", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000191057/dsa-2021-163-dell-supportassist-client-consumer-security-update-for-two-vulnerabilities"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-36286"], "assigner": "dell", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e856900-6350-30d0-9de4-3aad500a5e36", "product": {"name": "SupportAssist Client Consumer"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u22643.9.13.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e1250c3-b7eb-33c7-a9b0-3e79fb1a3c6e", "vendor": {"name": "Dell"}}], "isExploited": false}
