This vulnerability is due to improper input validation when an affected device is processing an MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packets to an interface that is enabled for MPLS forwarding on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the MPLS OAM process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-08-25T19:11:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:02:19", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-mpls-oam-dos-sGO9x5GM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1588"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "647f2a2f-7663-3435-b901-7101934b7295", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d7e916e-bc2b-304d-8270-6a33c033f531", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
