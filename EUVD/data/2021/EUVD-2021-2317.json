In affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.", "datePublished": "2021-11-15T20:10:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:08:31", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/security/advisories/GHSA-844m-cpr9-jcmh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41263", "https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite/commit/c6785cdb5c9277dd2c5ac8d55180dd1ece440ed0", "https://github.com/discourse/rails_multisite", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rails_multisite/CVE-2021-41263.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41263", "GHSA-844m-cpr9-jcmh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7eeb1be9-4308-36bb-ac22-889c79777266", "product": {"name": "rails_multisite"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1577bcbe-e275-3a28-af96-f2f0388a3b5c", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
