These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient restrictions for IPv4 or IPv6 packets that are received on the external management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending specific traffic to this interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive internal services and make configuration changes on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-07-22T15:20:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:05:30", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsi2-iptaclbp-L8Dzs8m8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1601"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9c15d77b-f52e-3b0f-bf81-39708a504749", "product": {"name": "Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b2abac2d-ed4a-3af5-8aed-8436d1289215", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
