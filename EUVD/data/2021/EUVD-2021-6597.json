The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have administrative credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:20:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:47:15", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-xss-HfV73cS3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1130"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ec62824c-d231-3afb-9e07-0148dc845828", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c80db2a4-706e-3afc-bb8f-8d7c933970c0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
