This vulnerability is due to insufficient security requirements during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on the adjacent subnet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect an unauthorized server to the infrastructure VLAN, which is highly privileged. With a connection to the infrastructure VLAN, the attacker can make unauthorized connections to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) services or join other host endpoints.", "datePublished": "2021-02-24T19:30:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:39:43", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n9kaci-unauth-access-5PWzDx2w"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1228"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5fc7f73a-ff3c-38a6-99ff-516d093001a3", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode 11.0(1b)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "55c82625-9a89-3489-bee7-1f829729d35d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
