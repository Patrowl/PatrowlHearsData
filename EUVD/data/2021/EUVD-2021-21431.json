This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error handling when an SSH session fails to be established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted SSH connections to the instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause resource exhaustion, which causes a DoS condition on the affected device. The device must be manually reloaded to recover.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:55:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:46:12", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-dos-rUDseW3r"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34781"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f28370a8-19b4-3ad5-99b3-d049a6c5c68c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "391543af-dbde-3b37-ad32-9616b1ea6d68", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
