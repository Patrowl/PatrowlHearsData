This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for specific API endpoints. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting and modifying specific internode communications from one ISE persona to another ISE persona. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to decrypt HTTPS traffic between two ISE personas that are located on separate nodes.", "datePublished": "2021-10-06T19:46:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:47:46", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-priv-esc-UwqPrBM3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1594"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d1abb1ef-84af-3c15-b521-aaf8eb416946", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "818d1c0f-466b-36cf-9bbc-cd6a47367867", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
