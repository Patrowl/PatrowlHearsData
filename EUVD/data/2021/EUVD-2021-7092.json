This vulnerability exists because ICMP and UDP responder-to-initiator flows are not inspected when the Zone-Based Policy Firewall has either Unified Threat Defense (UTD) or Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send UDP or ICMP flows through the network. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject traffic through the Zone-Based Policy Firewall, resulting in traffic being dropped because it is incorrectly classified or in incorrect reporting figures being produced by high-speed logging (HSL).", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:25:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:59:39", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-zbfw-pP9jfzwL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1625"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3f44798b-4025-3bc4-bb9c-a65f0aa5fabb", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9bb9ae3f-9ddb-33b8-a3b0-4857a00bd622", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
