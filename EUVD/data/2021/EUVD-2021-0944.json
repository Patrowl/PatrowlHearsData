In OAuth2 Proxy before version 7.0.0, for users that use the whitelist domain feature, a domain that ended in a similar way to the intended domain could have been allowed as a redirect. For example, if a whitelist domain was configured for \".example.com\", the intention is that subdomains of example.com are allowed. Instead, \"example.com\" and \"badexample.com\" could also match. This is fixed in version 7.0.0 onwards. As a workaround, one can disable the whitelist domain feature and run separate OAuth2 Proxy instances for each subdomain.", "datePublished": "2021-02-02T19:05:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21291", "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/commit/780ae4f3c99b579cb2ea9845121caebb6192f725", "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/releases/tag/v7.0.0", "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/v7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21291", "GHSA-4mf2-f3wh-gvf2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b07d191d-c19c-3664-be38-5bc6ce3e6977", "product": {"name": "oauth2-proxy"}, "product_version": "< 7.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "19a2784b-9a05-33f4-a3d2-3a1e3d4686bc", "vendor": {"name": "oauth2-proxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
