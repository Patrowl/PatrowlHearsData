In verions 3.7.2 and 3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remote endpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys.", "datePublished": "2021-05-28T20:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-jq42-hfch-42f3", "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32635", "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/commit/d52ae9d13979733c5e987a566fae59ed6f1bf796", "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity", "https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.7.4", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-50", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32635.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-32635.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32635", "GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.63, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6db5e5b3-8c90-319e-b2b9-9a7558014f8c", "product": {"name": "singularity"}, "product_version": "3.7.2, \u2264 3.7.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c49a3b1-c0fc-37e9-b723-48200bff5834", "vendor": {"name": "sylabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
