To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of resources that are loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a configuration file in a specific path in the system which, in turn, causes a malicious DLL file to be loaded when the application starts. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with SYSTEM privileges.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:17:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:48:12", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-dll-injec-pQnryXLf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1237"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a800faf4-2cdd-3d13-b352-2f0e1c8ea38b", "product": {"name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "00c36754-0b64-3d96-8804-8689e4c3987a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
