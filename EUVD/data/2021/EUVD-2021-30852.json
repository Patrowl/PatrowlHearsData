Persistent XSS vulnerabilities occur when the application stores and retrieves client supplied data without proper handling of dangerous content. This type of XSS vulnerability is exploited by submitting malicious script content to the application which is then retrieved and executed by other application users. The attacker could exploit this to conduct a range of attacks against users of the affected application such as session hijacking, account take over and accessing sensitive data.", "datePublished": "2021-12-03T14:42:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:10:17", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://appcheck-ng.com/persistent-xss-kentico-cms/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43991"], "assigner": "AppCheck", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aef9ed3f-dee3-32c0-9102-817464173886", "product": {"name": "Kentico Xperience XMS"}, "product_version": "13.0 <13.0.43"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b8cfd78d-9d32-3741-b9f3-01635adda24d", "vendor": {"name": "Kentico"}}], "isExploited": false}
