In affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim\u2019s network may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim\u2019s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2021-12-22T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:17", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-2qpg-f6wf-w984", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/15663e3f37091069b8c98a7fce680dc04bc8e865", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/0", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166225/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2022-004.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37706"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9b0c4bae-faa1-34c8-a912-53cbbd56dd9d", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f2c7d3b-c611-3fac-8981-b05e8fdb3282", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
