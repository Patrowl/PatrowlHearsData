The provided input for ECALL 14 triggers a branch in trustedEcdsaSign that frees a non-initialized pointer from the stack. An attacker can chain multiple enclave calls to prepare a stack that contains a valid address. This address is then freed, resulting in compromised integrity of the enclave. This was resolved after v1.58.3 and not reproducible in sgxwallet v1.77.0.", "datePublished": "2021-09-27T13:22:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T00:54:51", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/releases", "https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/commit/4e9b5b7526db083177e81f8bafeaa4914d276a82"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-36219"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2aa70cd5-ced7-3feb-a1a8-14436453fdc5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "352c53bc-42f2-3de4-a09b-176d774b08ce", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
