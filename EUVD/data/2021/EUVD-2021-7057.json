This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the system login block-for command when an attack is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-08-25T19:11:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:02:13", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-login-blockfor-RwjGVEcu"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1590"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a33ded35-7718-39cf-9431-533241bb6890", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "45f1d439-6d35-3fc3-9669-003f66e90ada", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
