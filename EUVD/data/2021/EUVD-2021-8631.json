In OneDev before version 4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability involving the build endpoint parameters. InputSpec is used to define parameters of a Build spec. It does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user able to control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by escaping special characters such as quote from user input.", "datePublished": "2021-01-15T20:10:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-gwp4-5498-hv5f", "https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/commit/39d95ab8122c5d9ed18e69dc024870cae08d2d60"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21248"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02ff1729-06c7-31f3-82b8-0c03c8bffccf", "product": {"name": "onedev"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a4505ef9-9374-346d-a8e7-9cf52168c36a", "vendor": {"name": "theonedev"}}], "isExploited": false}
