Mifos-Mobile before commit e505f62 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed certificate as valid. Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks.
