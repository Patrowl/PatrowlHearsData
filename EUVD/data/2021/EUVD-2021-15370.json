Running PV backends in driver domains has one primary security advantage: if a driver domain gets compromised, it doesn't have the privileges to take over the system. However, a malicious driver domain could try to attack other guests via sending events at a high frequency leading to a Denial of Service in the guest due to trying to service interrupts for elongated amounts of time. There are three affected backends: * blkfront patch 1, CVE-2021-28711 * netfront patch 2, CVE-2021-28712 * hvc_xen (console) patch 3, CVE-2021-28713", "datePublished": "2022-01-05T16:10:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:55:11", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28713.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5050", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5096", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-28713", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-28713.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2021-28713.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-391.txt", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00011.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00012.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28713"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a86b5e63-0372-327a-829d-30c8eccda6fc", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
