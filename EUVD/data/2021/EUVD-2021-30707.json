This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue.", "datePublished": "2021-12-14T22:20:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:03:08", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/security/advisories/GHSA-58vr-c56v-qr57", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-footnote/commit/796617e0131277011207541313522cd1946661ab"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43827"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3aacb63d-14cf-3347-ba98-ce9dc213b1e1", "product": {"name": "discourse-footnote"}, "product_version": "< 0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "decbb4fb-c646-3b92-8a6c-ad489ba20f0d", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
