This vulnerability exists because ARP entries are mismanaged. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by continuously sending traffic that results in incomplete ARP entries. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause ARP requests on the device to be unsuccessful for legitimate hosts, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:10:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:32:34", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-arp-mtfhBfjE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1377"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bedb5083-6476-3392-ba35-731559c2019b", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2957a1cb-703a-3f04-b7e9-9f4e8d9a9b24", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
