The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected. A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section. Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`. One may manually edit the app.js file post-build as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2021-07-15T18:30:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:56", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/security/advisories/GHSA-rqjw-p5vr-c695", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32770"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32770", "GHSA-rqjw-p5vr-c695"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9520ee2e-1478-320a-bf6c-d43873aebf12", "product": {"name": "gatsby"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.8"}, {"id": "a80d6d1f-e54e-317b-a14b-10c53b62ec1b", "product": {"name": "gatsby"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "531951cf-e967-3d69-b347-606269130ad1", "vendor": {"name": "gatsbyjs"}}], "isExploited": false}
