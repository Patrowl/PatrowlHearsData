In affected versions users who use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash 0.8.0 and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth), instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth). Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots).", "datePublished": "2021-10-05T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-10-11T01:16:42", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/commit/2b253e57fe64ec575079c8cdc99fe2013502ea31", "https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/security/advisories/GHSA-823f-cwm9-4g74", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41124", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/scrapy-splash/PYSEC-2021-364.yaml", "https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/releases/tag/0.8.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41124", "GHSA-823f-cwm9-4g74", "PYSEC-2021-364"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "41a709fe-8598-3bb8-a80e-77832a9b4e62", "product": {"name": "scrapy-splash"}, "product_version": "< 0.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "09c0b270-f6ee-3d64-a30f-1a0931d8ddf0", "vendor": {"name": "scrapy-plugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
