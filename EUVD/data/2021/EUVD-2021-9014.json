A specially crafted MPEG-4 input can cause an integer overflow due to unchecked arithmetic resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow that causes memory corruption. After validating the number of ranges, at [41] the library will multiply the count by the size of the GF_SubsegmentRangeInfo structure. On a 32-bit platform, this multiplication can result in an integer overflow causing the space of the array being allocated to be less than expected. An attacker can convince a user to open a video to trigger this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T12:33:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:23:29", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4966", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-21843.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-21843", "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1297", "https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1297"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21843"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2fb8de15-9eb8-3980-9e31-2e61a9e6a1b4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
