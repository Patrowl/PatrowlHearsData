Envoy does not decode escaped slash sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker may craft a path with escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access control, e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy. ### Impact Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with enforcement based on URL path. Users with back end servers that interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\\` interchangeably are impacted. ### Attack Vector URL paths containing escaped slash characters delivered by untrusted client. Patches in versions 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization option to decode escaped slash characters. As a workaround, if back end servers treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\\` interchangeably and a URL path based access control is configured, one may reconfigure the back end server to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\\` interchangeably.", "datePublished": "2021-05-28T21:00:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29492.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1540", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1538", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29492", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-4987-27fx-x6cf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29492"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 7.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "497e1763-166b-308b-877b-0762bdc26ca1", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.18.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6912fb4d-1abc-389e-b63b-cfff2839e2f1", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
