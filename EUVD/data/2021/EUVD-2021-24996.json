The power indicator LED of the speakers is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption. The sound played by the speakers affects their power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LEDs. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LEDs of the speakers, we can recover the sound played by them.", "datePublished": "2021-08-11T15:24:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:44:23", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nassiben.com/glowworm-attack"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38548"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0077be58-7e2c-3700-a4d0-0f61ef1dad66", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3f1dc9b9-b59a-3b73-b81e-a7cd98606f15", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
