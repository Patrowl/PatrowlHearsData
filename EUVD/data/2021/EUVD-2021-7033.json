This vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation when an affected device establishes TLS connections. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to spoof a trusted host and then extract sensitive information or alter certain API requests.", "datePublished": "2021-06-16T17:45:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:08:10", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-wsa-cert-vali-n8L97RW"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1566"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5198c96-6beb-3104-8756-1b845e7f7f72", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3552aac3-e461-362e-9f12-f99c5b44a066", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
