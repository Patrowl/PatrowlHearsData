Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap buffer is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This can result in code execution under the context of the application.", "datePublished": "2021-12-22T18:07:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:44:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1426"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40417"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 1.54, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1d912480-3d17-3b12-97ed-2f30656508f2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
