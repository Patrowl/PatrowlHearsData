It has been discovered that the new TYPO3 v11 feature that allows users to create and share deep links in the backend user interface is vulnerable to cross-site-request-forgery. The impact is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-006 (CVE-2020-11069). However, it is not limited to the same site context and does not require the attacker to be authenticated. In a worst case scenario, the attacker could create a new admin user account to compromise the system. To successfully carry out an attack, an attacker must trick his victim to access a compromised system. The victim must have an active session in the TYPO3 backend at that time. The following Same-Site cookie settings in $GLOBALS[TYPO3_CONF_VARS][BE][cookieSameSite] are required for an attack to be successful: SameSite=strict: malicious evil.example.org invoking TYPO3 application at good.example.org and SameSite=lax or none: malicious evil.com invoking TYPO3 application at example.org. Update your instance to TYPO3 version 11.5.0 which addresses the problem described.", "datePublished": "2021-10-05T17:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/security/advisories/GHSA-657m-v5vm-f6rw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11069", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41113", "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3/commit/fa51999203c5e5d913ecae5ea843ccb2b95fa33f", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms-core/CVE-2021-41113.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms/CVE-2021-41113.yaml", "https://github.com/TYPO3/typo3", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-006", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-014"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41113", "GHSA-657m-v5vm-f6rw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b9592b6a-f72f-350e-b820-02d51840fd56", "product": {"name": "typo3"}, "product_version": "11.2.0, < 11.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d0b1f7d-a585-3fec-99e6-06eac509587b", "vendor": {"name": "TYPO3"}}], "isExploited": false}
