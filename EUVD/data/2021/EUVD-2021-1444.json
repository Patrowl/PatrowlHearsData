The `Utils.readChallengeTx` function used in SEP-10 Stellar Web Authentication states in its function documentation that it reads and validates the challenge transaction including verifying that the `serverAccountID` has signed the transaction. In js-stellar-sdk before version 8.2.3, the function does not verify that the server has signed the transaction. Applications that also used `Utils.verifyChallengeTxThreshold` or `Utils.verifyChallengeTxSigners` to verify the signatures including the server signature on the challenge transaction are unaffected as those functions verify the server signed the transaction. Applications calling `Utils.readChallengeTx` should update to version 8.2.3, the first version with a patch for this vulnerability, to ensure that the challenge transaction is completely valid and signed by the server creating the challenge transaction.", "datePublished": "2021-07-02T18:15:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:54", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6cgh-hjpw-q3gq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32738", "https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/commit/6f0bb889c2d10b431ddd5f4a1bcdd519c80430b3", "https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk/releases/tag/v8.2.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32738", "GHSA-6cgh-hjpw-q3gq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ba644bb-7694-37f4-8c20-3b9852a35a59", "product": {"name": "js-stellar-sdk"}, "product_version": "< 8.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ef1abae-cb79-3e05-8304-50b96a04e27e", "vendor": {"name": "stellar"}}], "isExploited": false}
