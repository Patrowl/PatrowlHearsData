This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based SSL/TLS decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Datagram TLS (DTLS) messages cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:55:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:46:04", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-tls-decrypt-dos-BMxYjm8M"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34783"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "817549ba-b1db-39cc-b104-701d2bc67eee", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6aba17c7-df7c-356f-8b02-27bbaacae5a6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
