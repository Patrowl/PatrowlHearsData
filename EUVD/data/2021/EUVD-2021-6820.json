The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the available memory and cause an unexpected restart of the npusim process, leading to a DoS condition on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T20:00:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:21:29", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr-mem-leak-dos-MTWGHKk3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1353"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "16f16121-3597-394b-a090-15bf3b2201be", "product": {"name": "Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1cef990a-1a8d-33e2-acd0-98d9a98f264b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
