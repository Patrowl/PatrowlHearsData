Instead of comparing the CSRF token in the request with the CSRF token in the cookie, it compares the CSRF token in the cookie against a CSRF token that is stored in the session. An attacker does not even need to provide a CSRF token in the request because the framework does not consider it. The cookies are automatically sent by the browser and the verification will always succeed, leading to a successful CSRF attack.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T12:28:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:02:06", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-35217", "https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web/pull/1613"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-35217", "GHSA-9q69-g5gc-9fgf"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "53075693-31d3-3d95-92aa-9096a975d61b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d0aac71-ad93-3939-833e-0db650b4db48", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
