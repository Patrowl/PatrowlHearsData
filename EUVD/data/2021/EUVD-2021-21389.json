This vulnerability is due to insufficient expiration of session credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack against an affected device to intercept valid session credentials and then replaying the intercepted credentials toward the same device at a later time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the web-based management interface with administrator privileges.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T15:40:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:43:18", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-smb-switches-tokens-UzwpR4e5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34739"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4db68d03-e2ea-3410-b32d-be3633c4338c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business Smart and Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a26e1ae2-0f3d-32f9-b24c-84bd9c885aab", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
