This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of dial strings at Foreign Exchange Office (FXO) interfaces. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed dial string to an affected device via either the ISDN protocol or SIP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct toll fraud, resulting in unexpected financial impact to affected customers.", "datePublished": "2022-05-24T19:15:38", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-30T21:30:33", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxo-pattern-bypass-jUXgygYv", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34705"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34705"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ade85d0d-54e6-3967-88ab-00caa605b66f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "824910a9-97ca-3097-af09-e709615d0356", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
