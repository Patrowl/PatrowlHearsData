An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T15:42:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-18T16:36:46", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/RL:X/RC:X/E:X", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-path-trvsl-dZRQE8Lc", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-distupd-N87eB6Z3", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipphone-rce-dos-U2PsSkz3", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-ethernet-dos-HGXgJH8n", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwanvman-infodis1-YuQScHB", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-vmaninfdis3-OvdR6uu8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1132"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1611ae6c-e8b1-3233-83f7-9d4d0d1a79b5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator"}, "product_version": "5.4.0.2"}, {"id": "5ea53c2b-90ba-3c16-b707-b84b2d0a0201", "product": {"name": "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator"}, "product_version": "5.3.1"}, {"id": "f0323cf5-b739-3edb-8f8c-75ac0c81407a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator"}, "product_version": "5.4"}, {"id": "f495172d-33c2-3706-b1a5-7af7ee70b523", "product": {"name": "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator"}, "product_version": "5.4.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "31ef9e4a-b00c-3b20-95d2-a408c6eceb50", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
