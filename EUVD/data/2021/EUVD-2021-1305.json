Any project member with access to the default namespace can mount the netes-default service account in a pod, and then use that pod to execute administrative privileged commands against the k8s cluster. This could be mitigated by isolating the default namespace in a separate project, where only cluster admins can be given permissions to access. As of 2018-12-20, this bug affected ALL clusters created or imported by Rancher.", "datePublished": "2019-04-10T13:59:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T11:58:18", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20321", "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/commit/6ea187fcc2309d5a7a14ed47de5688bf6573f448", "https://forums.rancher.com/c/announcements", "https://github.com/rancher/rancher", "https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.1.6", "https://rancher.com/blog/2019/2019-01-29-explaining-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-rancher-v2-1-6-and-v2-0-11", "https://rancher.com/blog/2019/2019-01-29-explaining-security-vulnerabilities-addressed-in-rancher-v2-1-6-and-v2-0-11/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-20321", "GHSA-9qq2-xhmc-h9qr"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f433d12-c83d-30f9-a6e3-acfbf7440042", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9556eddc-b09d-3378-b71c-626105c45bda", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
