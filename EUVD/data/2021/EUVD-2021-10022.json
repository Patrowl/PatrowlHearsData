When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly \"short-cut\" the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.", "datePublished": "2021-04-01T17:46:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-09T15:11:58", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-22890.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4881", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2472", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2471", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-22890", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-22890.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-22890", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1129529", "https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2021-22890.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ITVWPVGLFISU5BJC2BXBRYSDXTXE2YGC/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KQUIOYX2KUU6FIUZVB5WWZ6JHSSYSQWJ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2ZC5BMIOKLBQJSFCHEDN2G2C2SH274BP/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-36", "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210521-0007/", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22890"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "05b0bc5b-311b-3352-a7e1-a0e5d413d471", "product": {"name": "https://github.com/curl/curl"}, "product_version": "7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "99a0cf81-1268-3e7c-8aa6-b1f75cf4da8c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
