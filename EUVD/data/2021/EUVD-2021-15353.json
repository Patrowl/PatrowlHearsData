While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).", "datePublished": "2021-08-27T18:46:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28696.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4977", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-28696.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-378.txt", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/6", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LPRVHW4J4ZCPPOHZEWP5MOJT7XDGFFPJ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FZCNPSRPGFCQRYE2BI4D4Q4SCE56ANV2/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VQCFAPBNGBBAOMJZG6QBREOG5IIDZID/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28696"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5d18d270-1ebe-35d3-920c-5350171d4a90", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "xen-unstable"}, {"id": "6e936df2-f4d6-3b9a-b3a2-156cf3831409", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.15.x"}, {"id": "8b2c4fd0-5781-3e3a-a714-c44a89c60dec", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.14.x"}, {"id": "96ae7576-c487-3aa0-bf73-cba94578d4c4", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.13.x"}, {"id": "bb79b5be-8cef-34d6-b2b9-282394f29e41", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.12.x"}, {"id": "f078c9d4-992c-3ccd-a12a-cc03c84e18c9", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.11.x"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b411067f-c935-31ec-9428-0a5af2a9a184", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
