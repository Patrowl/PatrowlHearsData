This occurs because node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers) and the access control on Services/NodeManagement.asmx/DeleteObjNow is incorrect. To exploit this, an attacker must be authenticated and must have node management rights associated with at least one valid group on the platform.", "datePublished": "2021-07-27T15:41:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://pastebin.com/zFUd2cCj", "https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-28674"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28674"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "56fba0a0-bdb0-3098-90af-72eb8b8ce71d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "54e1f7c4-d10f-333c-a68a-faad834cb335", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
