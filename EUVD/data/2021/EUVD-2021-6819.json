The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of DECnet traffic that is received by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending DECnet traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:16:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:31:27", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-decnet-dos-cuPWDkyL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1352"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e899f59-88a7-3b0c-b36f-bcd6be0bb202", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aba4510d-fbf4-34d1-b51d-c6f89aa73485", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
