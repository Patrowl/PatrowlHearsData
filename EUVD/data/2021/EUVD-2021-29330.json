As such, it was possible for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the site by sending an AJAX request with the \u201caction\u201d parameter set to \u201cadmin-dismiss-unsubscribe\u201d and the \u201cid\u201d parameter set to the post to be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash, and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in question.", "datePublished": "2021-11-05T19:44:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-14T17:52:42", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/11/vulnerability-in-wp-dsgvo-tools-gdpr-plugin-allows-unauthenticated-page-deletion/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-42359"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 20.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9397a0ce-c576-3f41-abc3-6ee2de668652", "product": {"name": "WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR)"}, "product_version": "3.1.23 \u22643.1.23"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7733237a-8fc3-3fc2-806e-89d1e6fc3d41", "vendor": {"name": "legalweb"}}], "isExploited": false}
