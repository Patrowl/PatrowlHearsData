Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.", "datePublished": "2021-06-28T19:15:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:54", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32723", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/commit/d85e30da6755fdbe7f8559f8e75d122297167018", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32723", "GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "15589226-7557-385b-9505-923dbfefd8d3", "product": {"name": "prism"}, "product_version": "< 1.24"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9426993e-9d33-3800-8ade-1e1e30021af6", "vendor": {"name": "PrismJS"}}], "isExploited": false}
