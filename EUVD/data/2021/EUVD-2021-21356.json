This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker.", "datePublished": "2021-10-06T19:46:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:48:09", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxe-inj-V4VSjEsX"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34706"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "627fb6ea-7113-3cab-9def-0959db976dfb", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25ac4b97-f26f-3b29-b134-7a51951b744c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
