These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T17:30:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:23:47", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-yT8LNSeA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1458"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3831b03-7046-386b-a20f-985f6748e017", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f7560ca5-9441-32d2-ab25-d656af7a0dc7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
