An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efff014f3b2d8ef6141da30c806faf141297eca1/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L123-L127) computes a divisor value from user data but does not check that the result is 0 before doing the division. Since `data` is given by the `values` argument, `num_batch_elements` is 0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.", "datePublished": "2021-05-14T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:31", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-qg48-85hg-mqc5", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da5ff2daf618591f64b2b62d9d9803951b945e9f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29554", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2021-482.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2021-680.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2021-191.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29554.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29554"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29554", "GHSA-qg48-85hg-mqc5", "PYSEC-2021-482"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a2359f7-0c53-3a8a-bb04-452b460d6659", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.4.0, < 2.4.2"}, {"id": "a879cf04-9a94-3b2c-a813-729bf2c28a72", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e5378a2-4c11-3a7d-b316-d8466b3bd485", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
