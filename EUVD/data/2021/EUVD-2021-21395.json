This vulnerability is due to the .NET Agent Coordinator Service executing code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker with local access to a device that is running the vulnerable agent could create a custom process that would be launched with those SYSTEM privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
