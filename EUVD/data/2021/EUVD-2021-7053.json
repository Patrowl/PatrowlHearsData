This vulnerability exists because TCP traffic sent to a specific port on an affected device is not properly sanitized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to a specific port that is listening on a public-facing IP address for the Multi-Pod or Multi-Site configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-08-25T19:10:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:02:32", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n9kaci-tcp-dos-YXukt6gM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1586"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1918febb-3529-3300-9b0a-62a3268ba4ad", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ebb9dbb8-56da-3b1b-b8f3-95e1bd7753b2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
