Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-32777 and CVE-2021-32779. This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions. With specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium. Pomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched. This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy. Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.", "datePublished": "2021-09-09T22:10:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-6g4j-5vrw-2m8h", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-r222-74fw-jqr9", "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-cfc2-wjcm-c8fm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39206", "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium", "https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/5xBpsEZZDfE/m/wD05NZBbAgAJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39206", "GHSA-cfc2-wjcm-c8fm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "36890767-53e0-36c1-8882-c5e9f4b83966", "product": {"name": "pomerium"}, "product_version": "0.11.0, < 0.14.8"}, {"id": "98745b50-92b6-3892-961b-aae02ee7d809", "product": {"name": "pomerium"}, "product_version": "0.15.0, < 0.15.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "443e2a62-3bee-3084-90d9-74490f1904b5", "vendor": {"name": "pomerium"}}], "isExploited": false}
