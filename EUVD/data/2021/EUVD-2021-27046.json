The reference count is maintained as an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference count to overflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm buffer objects, or if it can coerce the server to create a large number of external references to the buffer storage. With the reference count overflowing, a use-after-free can be constructed on the wl_shm_pool tracking structure, where values may be incremented or decremented; it may also be possible to construct a limited oracle to leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to the attacking client at a time.", "datePublished": "2022-09-23T15:26:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:09:08", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-3782.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3782.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3782", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/issues/224"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3782"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39f1cb3b-1f20-3cca-be73-57ecda3fa165", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
