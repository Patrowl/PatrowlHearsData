An error in the implementation of the limits service between versions 4.0.0 and 4.9.4 allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. This issue is patched in Ghost version 4.10.0. As a workaround, disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access. It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround.", "datePublished": "2021-09-03T14:50:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-j5c2-hm46-wp5c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39192", "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost", "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases/tag/v4.10.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39192", "GHSA-j5c2-hm46-wp5c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "327d090a-20f5-3a22-ab2a-ae96b784c9ab", "product": {"name": "Ghost"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "110bb054-a4ff-358c-af8f-f41c11f1565c", "vendor": {"name": "TryGhost"}}], "isExploited": false}
