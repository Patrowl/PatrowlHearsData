{"id": "EUVD-2021-2232", "enisaUuid": "f46fa696-e31f-3183-9291-78d08da54cf0", "description": "Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions 15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's app. One may also disable the functionality of the `createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.", "datePublished": "2021-10-12T19:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-mpjm-v997-c4h4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39184", "https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/30728", "https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/30728/commits/8fed645bd671f359ee52d806c075ec4e07eda17f", "https://github.com/electron/electron", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-39184.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39184", "GHSA-mpjm-v997-c4h4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2e5499a9-b225-3f89-8972-77cdc0c2d41b", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "12.0.0, < 12.1.0"}, {"id": "c8a0a4c3-1818-3cda-b43b-eedff133ddec", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "13.0.0, < 13.3.0"}, {"id": "d1673dea-e5b4-3afd-b9b2-8d672eac080a", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "< 11.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ca1870b-27d8-3b77-b484-d337a1e216ce", "vendor": {"name": "electron"}}], "isExploited": false}
