These vulnerabilities are due to incomplete processing during deep packet inspection for ENIP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted ENIP packet to the targeted interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access control and intrusion policies that should be activated for the ENIP packet.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:55:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:46:19", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-enip-bypass-eFsxd8KP"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34754"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bdd60214-79a0-3eed-9ac7-6d9168e29932", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6289b562-02c3-3abd-a337-2e10884ee88d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
