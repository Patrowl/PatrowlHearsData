A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic links as well as files with backslash characters in the file name may cause just-checked out code to be executed while checking out a repository using Git on Cygwin. The problem will be patched in the Cygwin Git v2.31.1-2 release. At time of writing, the vulnerability is present in the upstream Git source code; any Cygwin user who compiles Git for themselves from upstream sources should manually apply a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. As mitigation users should not clone or pull from repositories from untrusted sources. CVE-2019-1354 was an equivalent vulnerability in Git for Visual Studio.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T20:35:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:05", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/security/advisories/GHSA-rmp3-wq55-f557", "https://github.com/me-and/Cygwin-Git/blob/main/check-backslash-safety.patch", "https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin-announce/2021-April/010018.html", "https://lore.kernel.org/git/CA+kUOa=juEdBMVr_gyTKjz7PkPt2DZHkXQyzcQmAWCsEHC_ssw@mail.gmail.com/T/#u", "https://lore.kernel.org/git/CA+kUOa=juEdBMVr_gyTKjz7PkPt2DZHkXQyzcQmAWCsEHC_ssw%40mail.gmail.com/T/#u"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29468"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19508e5b-5717-31cd-a48f-9176e693d65c", "product": {"name": "Cygwin-Git"}, "product_version": "< 2.31.1-2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ba5830aa-93ea-3a80-9f22-4a8d08f349ef", "vendor": {"name": "me-and"}}], "isExploited": false}
