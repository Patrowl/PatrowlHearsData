This vulnerability occurs because the code does not release the allocated IP address under certain failure conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to connect to the device with a non-AnyConnect client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the IP addresses from the assigned local pool, which prevents users from logging in and leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:31:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:51:30", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ikev2-ebFrwMPr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1620"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "086cf654-800c-3da7-9e82-4356800cfcf6", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8fa45ee4-df7e-3eec-9a07-c2304d05e326", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
