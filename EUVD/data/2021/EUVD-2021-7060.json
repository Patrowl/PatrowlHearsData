To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a configuration file in a specific path on the system, which can cause a malicious DLL file to be loaded when the application starts. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with normal user privileges to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of another user&rsquo;s account.", "datePublished": "2021-08-04T17:20:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:04:44", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-packettracer-dll-inj-Qv8Mk5Jx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1593"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "542ef56c-ef15-31ab-a94a-46309440ab8f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Packet Tracer"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a77fde12-7a09-300d-88d7-903626ed4ca7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
