To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid credentials on the Windows system. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory search paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file on the targeted system. This file will execute when the vulnerable application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with SYSTEM privileges.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T19:56:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:25:34", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-amp-imm-dll-5PAZ3hRV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1280"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "06b95f06-d260-358f-81ce-62e86ca9900a", "product": {"name": "Cisco AMP for Endpoints"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "032c81eb-7232-37a9-9aaa-389d36abe078", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
