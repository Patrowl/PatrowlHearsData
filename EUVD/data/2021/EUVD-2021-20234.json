Manipulated PC Worx or Config+ projects could lead to a remote code execution when unallocated memory is freed because of incompletely initialized data. The attacker needs to get access to an original bus configuration file (*.bcp) to be able to manipulate data inside. After manipulation the attacker needs to exchange the original file by the manipulated one on the application programming workstation. Availability, integrity, or confidentiality of an application programming workstation might be compromised by attacks using these vulnerabilities. Automated systems in operation which were programmed with one of the above-mentioned products are not affected.", "datePublished": "2021-06-25T18:26:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:31:44", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://cert.vde.com/en-us/advisories/vde-2021-020", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-782/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-33542"], "assigner": "CERTVDE", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "418f63fe-45ff-3ede-abff-e1cee72bdbf5", "product": {"name": "Automation Worx Software Suite"}, "product_version": "PC Worx Express \u22641.87"}, {"id": "70f74bba-b6d0-346b-a492-f02e0afc72e3", "product": {"name": "Automation Worx Software Suite"}, "product_version": "Config+ \u22641.87"}, {"id": "7bb0e202-083e-3715-a89c-f3885381bad8", "product": {"name": "Automation Worx Software Suite"}, "product_version": "PC Worx \u22641.87"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9e77839-636f-3279-8c02-ffee102731fb", "vendor": {"name": "PHOENIX CONTACT"}}], "isExploited": false}
