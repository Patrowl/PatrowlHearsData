A bypass of CVE-2020-26231 (fixed in 1.0.470/471 and 1.1.1) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-26231 & CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2. As a workaround, apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f63519ff1e8d375df30deba63156a2fc97aa9ee7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2.", "datePublished": "2021-05-03T16:00:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:14", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-fcr8-6q7r-m4wg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21264", "https://github.com/octobercms/october"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21264", "GHSA-fcr8-6q7r-m4wg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "26c36543-1e3d-3175-bca0-ee03518ab86f", "product": {"name": "October"}, "product_version": "1.0.471"}, {"id": "968c7024-a33d-3e2d-8142-9387c5e92af8", "product": {"name": "October"}, "product_version": "1.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a63f5511-7d79-3ff2-b752-0322441cd207", "vendor": {"name": "octobercms"}}], "isExploited": false}
