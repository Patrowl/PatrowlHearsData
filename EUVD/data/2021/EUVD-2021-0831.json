A vulnerability in trestle-auth versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 allows an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth admin session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter protected data, including admin account credentials. The vulnerability has been fixed in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems.", "datePublished": "2021-04-13T17:00:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:02:51", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-h8hx-2c5r-32cf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29435", "https://github.com/TrestleAdmin/trestle-auth/commit/cb95b05cdb2609052207af07b4b8dfe3a23c11dc", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/trestle-auth/CVE-2021-29435.yml", "https://rubygems.org/gems/trestle-auth"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29435", "GHSA-h8hx-2c5r-32cf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "197af168-4548-3ec3-b68f-4b690a5ccd98", "product": {"name": "trestle-auth"}, "product_version": "0.4.0, < 0.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0de63225-5a60-382e-aee6-ef46320cfa04", "vendor": {"name": "TrestleAdmin"}}], "isExploited": false}
