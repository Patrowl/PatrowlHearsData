The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of log file content stored on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a log file with malicious code and getting a user to view the modified log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:20:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:47:08", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nfvis-xss-smsz5Vhb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1127"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bfae41c3-0c4b-36cc-bddc-f981737560ec", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "721203b8-0b63-34df-bb27-5ef6eba48d4e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
