This vulnerability is due to an overly descriptive error message on the dashboard that appears when a user attempts to modify their email address when the new address already exists in the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to modify the user's email address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate email addresses of users in the system.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T15:36:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:42:55", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-umbrella-user-enum-S7XfJwDE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40126"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "452d8b35-420a-3c38-b07a-3d52b3a2437f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Umbrella Insights Virtual Appliance"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9887f4ef-f5ee-3c33-b0a3-1c776675010c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
