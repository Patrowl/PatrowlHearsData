Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 \\\"Push rules\\\" can specify conditions under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.", "datePublished": "2021-05-11T15:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:06", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.33.2", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-x345-32rc-8h85", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/03318a766cac9f8b053db2214d9c332a977d226c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29471", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/matrix-synapse/PYSEC-2021-135.yaml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29471.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29471", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TNNAJOZNMVMXM6AS7RFFKB4QLUJ4IFEY/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29471", "GHSA-x345-32rc-8h85", "PYSEC-2021-135"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "164ec1ab-303b-3943-afad-490f1fc49d48", "product": {"name": "synapse"}, "product_version": "< 1.33.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "32f375ec-388f-39e3-b85d-09a8a5c00dd0", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
