These are typically used for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. If such a device is passed through to a guest, then on guest shutdown the device is not properly deassigned. The IOMMU configuration for these devices which are not properly deassigned ends up pointing to a freed data structure, including the IO Pagetables. Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device will have unpredictable behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.", "datePublished": "2021-10-06T13:13:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:32", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28702.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5017", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-386.txt", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/2", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRAWV6PO2KUGVZTESERECOBUBZ6X45I7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FDPRMOBBLS74ONYP3IXZZXSTLKR7GRQB/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2OIHEJ3R3EH5DYI2I5UMD2ULJ2ELA3EX/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28702"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3fa4c9f9-acf7-3ec5-83e3-d4b45b78d727", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.12.x <unspecified"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4bf7f38c-f692-3d99-a4e1-64177975a3f2", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
