An attacker that obtained access to the administrative web interface of a printer (e.g., by using the default credentials) can download the address book file, which contains the list of users (domain users, FTP users, etc.) stored on the printer, together with their encrypted passwords. The passwords are protected by a weak cipher, such as ROT13, which requires minimal effort to instantly retrieve the original password, giving the attacker a list of valid domain or FTP usernames and passwords.", "datePublished": "2022-03-03T14:32:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:03:08", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.foregenix.com/blog", "https://www.fujifilm.com/fbglobal/eng/company/news/notice/2022/0302_addressbook_announce.html", "https://www.foregenix.com/blogs-new-2021/dude-its-just-a-printer"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43774"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "272fd2e9-123d-305e-84c9-2842a5b70724", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "05af0c15-d113-3ded-9ae1-71c10c63f277", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
