This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "datePublished": "2021-04-05T21:31:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:37:23", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-20305.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4933", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2760", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2758", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2356", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2280", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1246", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1245", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1206", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1145", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-20305", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-20305.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-20305", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-20305.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1942533", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-31", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MQKWVVMAIDAJ7YAA3VVO32BHLDOH2E63/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00008.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211022-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20305"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e04dbe4-bb40-3f3b-8577-bcea1fc814f9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
