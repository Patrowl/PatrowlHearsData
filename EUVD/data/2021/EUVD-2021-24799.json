The file would be named using the id parameter, which could be prepended with \"../\" to perform directory traversal, and the file contents were populated via the ibsf parameter, which would be base64-decoded and written to the file. While the plugin added a .jpg extension to all uploaded filenames, a double extension attack was still possible, e.g. a file named shell.php would be saved as shell.php.jpg, and would be executable on a number of common configurations.", "datePublished": "2021-10-14T15:56:57", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-14T18:11:15", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/10/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-brizy-page-builder-plugin-allow-site-takeover/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38346"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 2.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "218954a3-c229-3015-8805-6c0d74f9b467", "product": {"name": "Brizy - Page Builder"}, "product_version": "2.3.11 \u22642.3.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22ab5199-adfc-3917-9898-5b71587a9626", "vendor": {"name": "Brizy.io"}}], "isExploited": false}
