{"id": "EUVD-2021-0001", "enisaUuid": "560e1780-2f1e-3e1a-9cbc-83c6037c3ee1", "description": "The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope \\\"Manager\\\" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk. The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.", "datePublished": "2021-07-30T22:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-05-04T04:29:31", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/blob/master/CHANGES.rst#51-2021-07-30", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/b42dd4badf803bb9fb71ac34cd9cb0c249262f2c", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/security/advisories/GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-g4gq-j4p2-j8fr", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/f72a18dda8e9bf2aedb46168761668464a4be988", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32811", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/869f947e586517566509e0ccdd4d99b60704cc02", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/zope/PYSEC-2021-368.yaml", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32807", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/AccessControl/commit/ae2dab0cc34e6dd1561c5b12d4a56cd140f87e1d", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/accesscontrol/PYSEC-2021-335.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/accesscontrol/PYSEC-2021-370.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32807", "GHSA-qcx9-j53g-ccgf", "PYSEC-2021-335", "CVE-2021-32811", "GHSA-g4gq-j4p2-j8fr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35b5ebc9-d8d7-314f-8a63-618eeaa0f460", "product": {"name": "AccessControl"}, "product_version": "5.0, < 5.2"}, {"id": "54d3d6fa-cc60-35fa-b7db-1e53a9e1c818", "product": {"name": "AccessControl"}, "product_version": "4.0, < 4.3"}, {"id": "5b638467-c958-3d5e-935b-c8a349c9e707", "product": {"name": "Zope"}, "product_version": "4.0, < 4.6.3"}, {"id": "b59f29e4-1c49-3c73-aca2-6f4761c9312c", "product": {"name": "Zope"}, "product_version": "5.0, < 5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ebe25aed-b10d-38aa-a6c9-1f8d698d2981", "vendor": {"name": "zopefoundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
