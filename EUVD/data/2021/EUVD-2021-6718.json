{"id": "EUVD-2021-6718", "enisaUuid": "7f0ca316-5a42-3d3d-b7c2-582943cd949f", "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause an affected router to leak system memory or reload. A memory leak or device reload would cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2021-04-08T04:05:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:29:59", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-multi-lldp-u7e4chCe"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1251"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b17ee71-5efd-3e03-9200-37b5394f1abd", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa8751f5-0afa-3a80-adff-971e82c83d11", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
