In Syncthing before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.", "datePublished": "2021-04-06T20:00:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:16", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/security/advisories/GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21404", "https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/commit/fb4fdaf4c0a79c22cad000c42ac1394e3ccb6a97", "https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/tag/v1.15.0", "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/syncthing/syncthing", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-21404.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-21404"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21404", "GHSA-x462-89pf-6r5h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "30023f56-d98a-3a14-af2c-20147fc88438", "product": {"name": "syncthing"}, "product_version": "< 1.15.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec64c31b-9b6a-3760-b2c6-a2335fdd63b7", "vendor": {"name": "syncthing"}}], "isExploited": false}
