In affected versions the Nextcloud Circles application is vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Circles application is upgraded to 0.21.3, 0.20.10 or 0.19.14 to resolve this issue. As a workaround users may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.", "datePublished": "2021-09-07T20:00:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-hgpq-28gj-jrj9", "https://github.com/nextcloud/circles/commit/dbb97a83ccb342c839a54f088aa19b8ba6844b0e", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1217606"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32782"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d4d636f-1ebe-3058-9df6-27f38f649bc7", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "0.21.0, < 0.21.3"}, {"id": "cf5fb60b-575a-39db-b59b-5ad496b484de", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 0.19.1"}, {"id": "ee83567f-e5fa-3bdb-948f-7ad8e67201b5", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "0.20.0, < 0.20.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9b0a8f25-4198-3858-8350-33aa7241a1db", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
