The email configuration component inserts user-controlled values, including the EMAIL_PW parameter, directly into system-level operations without proper input sanitation. By modifying the email password field to include shell metacharacters and issuing a save-and-test-mail action, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the web interface, resulting in full system compromise.", "datePublished": "2025-11-14T22:52:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T20:34:34", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50183", "https://www.ipcop.org/", "https://sourceforge.net/projects/ipcop/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/ipcop-authenticated-rce", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4466"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-4466"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3d9b155-da43-3e16-a1f7-421326a8ceed", "product": {"name": "IPCop"}, "product_version": "0 \u22642.1.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87561b73-a9cf-380a-a8e9-3013306b2f4d", "vendor": {"name": "IPCop Project"}}], "isExploited": false}
