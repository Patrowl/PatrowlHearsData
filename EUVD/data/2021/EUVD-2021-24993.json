We assume that the Raspberry Pi supplies power to some speakers. The power indicator LED of the Raspberry Pi is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption. The sound played by the speakers affects the Raspberry Pi's power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LED. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the Raspberry Pi, we can recover the sound played by the speakers.", "datePublished": "2021-08-11T15:25:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:44:23", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nassiben.com/glowworm-attack"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38545"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "735162d9-9327-363b-8ed4-0ab4726c7d48", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b6a81775-a77f-355f-a67f-61283c353223", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
