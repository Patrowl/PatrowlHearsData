The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the \"int_ctl\" field, this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.14-rc7.", "datePublished": "2021-09-29T19:41:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:01:08", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3653.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4978", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4768", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4692", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3987", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3909", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3904", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3812", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3802", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3801", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3767", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3676", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3548", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3547", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3653", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-3653.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3653", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3653.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1983686", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/16/1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00010.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00012.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165477/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0083-1.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3653"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "15a43919-caaa-347f-b1d2-9bc7494b4370", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
