In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options.", "datePublished": "2021-06-16T18:45:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/security/advisories/GHSA-35g4-qx3c-vjhx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32659", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/330", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/b69e745584a34fcfd858df33e4631e420da07b9f", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/2.6.1", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32659"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32659", "GHSA-35g4-qx3c-vjhx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "787efbed-33b0-33a3-b6ef-9f3710427ed1", "product": {"name": "matrix-appservice-bridge"}, "product_version": "< 2.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4e51b08-d6c5-3003-b631-fb94bef3ba38", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
