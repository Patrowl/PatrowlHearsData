While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).", "datePublished": "2021-08-27T18:46:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28694.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4977", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-28694.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-378.txt", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/6", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LPRVHW4J4ZCPPOHZEWP5MOJT7XDGFFPJ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FZCNPSRPGFCQRYE2BI4D4Q4SCE56ANV2/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VQCFAPBNGBBAOMJZG6QBREOG5IIDZID/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28694"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "04025599-914c-3cf9-95d2-5dca28c0f312", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.14.x"}, {"id": "207a43d1-690b-3d8d-969b-ba063ce0d0a6", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.11.x"}, {"id": "43e2c3a1-a9c3-30f6-8a10-ff7ccf98abbd", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.12.x"}, {"id": "59be80f2-e32b-3ce2-bfb8-d51cee749256", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.13.x"}, {"id": "74b35f0d-b0e6-3495-b3ae-cdf301362dbe", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.15.x"}, {"id": "980ab463-f98d-354e-95e8-6eb8a2fa3a2f", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "xen-unstable"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "28758462-8317-3b58-8318-e961aa678497", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
