This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain TCP segments when the affected device is operating in transparent mode. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP segment through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to poison the MAC address tables in adjacent devices, resulting in network disruption.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:56:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:45:43", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-dos-JxYWMJyL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34793"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "44137709-e7b6-31c5-9a50-7c5278109bf7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1eaa125a-d3bf-394a-af16-50b5faf8b8cb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
