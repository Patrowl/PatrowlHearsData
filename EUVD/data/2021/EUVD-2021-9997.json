This vulnerability existed due to a flaw that allowed the base reference of a pull request to be updated to point to an arbitrary SHA or another pull request outside of the fork repository. By establishing this incorrect reference in a PR, the restrictions that limit the Actions secrets sent a workflow from forks could be bypassed. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server version 3.0.0, 3.0.0.rc2, and 3.0.0.rc1. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.", "datePublished": "2021-03-03T03:25:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:51:07", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.1", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22862"], "assigner": "GitHub_P", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5131e97b-3b21-3e8d-8946-7e1194b2970a", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "3.0 <3.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "58ddb5e3-d4f2-333a-a8c5-6defccd00823", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
