These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-02-04T16:56:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:44:35", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-command-inject-BY4c5zd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1317"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3b6e144c-1e94-3061-afb3-e99c92cb5a26", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a18d6432-5dad-3d84-bc31-92c47150defe", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
