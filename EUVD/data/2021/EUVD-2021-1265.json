In versions of helm prior to 3.6.1, a vulnerability exists where the username and password credentials associated with a Helm repository could be passed on to another domain referenced by that Helm repository. This issue has been resolved in 3.6.1. There is a workaround through which one may check for improperly passed credentials. One may use a username and password for a Helm repository and may audit the Helm repository in order to check for another domain being used that could have received the credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or installed, the credentials would be passed on.", "datePublished": "2021-06-16T22:10:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32690", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/61d8e8c4a6f95540c15c6a65f36a6dd0a45e7a2f", "https://github.com/helm/helm", "https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.6.1", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0384", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32690.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4902", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4618", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3925", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3759", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2021:3139", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32690"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32690", "GHSA-56hp-xqp3-w2jf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7b32418a-2032-35b5-9399-da83fa40d671", "product": {"name": "helm"}, "product_version": "< 3.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "69bd66dd-4d4e-310a-912b-0147d9ca7cda", "vendor": {"name": "helm"}}], "isExploited": false}
