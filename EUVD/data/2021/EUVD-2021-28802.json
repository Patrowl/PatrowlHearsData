Then, 'i' gets interpreted as 105 bytes to copy from the source buffer to the destination buffer.", "datePublished": "2021-10-07T14:57:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:22:24", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/10/06/technical-advisory-open5gs-stack-buffer-overflow-during-pfcp-session-establishment-on-upf-cve-2021-41794"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41794"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a380187-ad17-3e07-b6d9-10fa2246ea0e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d7a5914e-0a9c-3444-a316-940c76218347", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
