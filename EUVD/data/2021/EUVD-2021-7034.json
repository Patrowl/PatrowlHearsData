This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process for DLL files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.", "datePublished": "2021-06-16T17:45:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:08:15", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-pos-dll-ff8j6dFv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1567"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3f066d26-8d5a-3896-8c54-1350ccc4809c", "product": {"name": "Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "623211f6-0df2-3ab5-be7e-6441d874d7f0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
