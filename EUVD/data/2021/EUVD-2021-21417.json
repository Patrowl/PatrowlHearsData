The vulnerability is due to a logic error when processing specific link-local IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that would flow inbound through the wired interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic drops in the affected VLAN, thus triggering the DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-05-24T19:15:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-30T21:30:34", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-ipv6-dos-NMYeCnZv", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34767"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34767"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "faecae9e-7056-3fc5-a65f-7ee5a45803b9", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "831c62e7-19d1-3e27-9303-f83f2a9daa27", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
