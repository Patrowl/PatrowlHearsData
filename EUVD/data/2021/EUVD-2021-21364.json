This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the UDLD packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically crafted UDLD packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: The UDLD feature is disabled by default, and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict. An attacker must have full control of a directly connected device. On Cisco IOS XR devices, the impact is limited to the reload of the UDLD process.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:25:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:59:09", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-nxos-xr-udld-dos-W5hGHgtQ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34714"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b45308d-8d85-3901-8348-b4ba74f85c5c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff24d55d-a613-3155-bd41-3d5f81076f1c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
