This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming mDNS traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted mDNS packet to an affected device through a wireless network that is configured in FlexConnect local switching mode or through a wired network on a configured mDNS VLAN. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the access point (AP) to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:05:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:35:37", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aironet-mdns-dos-E6KwYuMx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1439"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "16d6bf56-ff5e-3c0a-977c-07d43bf570d9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software (IOS XE Controller)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "56083e63-9756-35b6-9ba0-7e59f8e7cec8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
