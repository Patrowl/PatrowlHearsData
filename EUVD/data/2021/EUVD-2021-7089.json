This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:25:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:59:58", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cbr8-cops-Vc2ZsJSx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1622"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72e2fa38-16be-371a-b7bb-df1ebd56668c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0fa2632b-5973-3257-af59-2b0c2a4b23b5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
