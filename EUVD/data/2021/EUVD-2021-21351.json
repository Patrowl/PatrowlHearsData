This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T15:40:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:42:34", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-path-trav-dKCvktvO"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34701"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b65236d4-fa2b-3d38-9ff7-2d31e434ab39", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "356ca43f-6053-33e6-b073-4200325ea90c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
