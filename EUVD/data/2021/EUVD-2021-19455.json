An inefficient algorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.", "datePublished": "2021-05-17T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:30", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32617.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4173", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-32617", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-32617.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32617", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-w8mv-g8qq-36mj", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1657", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5I3RRZUGSBIUYZ5TIHLN55PKMAWCSJ5G/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M2BPQNJKTRIDINTVJ22QMMTIZEPHVKXK/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQAKFIQHW2AS3AGSJM42ABOA6CWIJBGM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TZ5SGWHK64TB7ADRSVBGHEPDFN5CSOO3/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32617"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7c13ca32-f13c-320c-aacc-059690e161f5", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.27.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "425ad4ae-304e-322b-ab0e-5e44fe023667", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
