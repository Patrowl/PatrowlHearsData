{"id": "EUVD-2021-1119", "enisaUuid": "8c2e534e-f7fb-32cc-8870-44f08eef8e08", "description": "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm repository can contain duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used. If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository. To perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is to manually review the index file in the Helm repository cache before installing software.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T21:30:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 2.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-jm56-5h66-w453", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15185", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/055dd41cbe53ce131ab0357524a7f6729e6e40dc", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/6aab63765f99050b115f0aec3d6350c85e8da946", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15185.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2021:0729"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15185", "GHSA-jm56-5h66-w453"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "94cb73e7-a334-3b5c-9781-8e1d6d45ebbe", "product": {"name": "helm"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.16.11"}, {"id": "f38d3290-f6f6-3aa5-8b12-19f0ec946dc3", "product": {"name": "helm"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.3.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "043b32f0-53b5-3c8b-b305-2834a0638931", "vendor": {"name": "helm"}}], "isExploited": false}
