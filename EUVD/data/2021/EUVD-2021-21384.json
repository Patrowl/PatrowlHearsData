This vulnerability is due to improper management of memory resources, referred to as a double free. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T19:40:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:03:48", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcamera-lldp-dos-OFP7j9j"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34734"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dc3a8645-488f-3c37-a66c-8ede45035992", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9d1e08e-cfbf-3306-b36d-9351b076f434", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
