Versions prior to 0.11.0 allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on any macOS machine with ActivityWatch running. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having the user visiting a website with the page title set to a malicious string. An attacker could use another application to accomplish the same, but the web browser is the most likely attack vector. This issue is patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users can run the latest version of aw-watcher-window from source, or manually patch the `printAppTitle.scpt` file.", "datePublished": "2022-12-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch/security/advisories/GHSA-3x6w-q32m-jqf3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32692"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "113cc71c-f866-3d57-8eb0-d10063b38a19", "product": {"name": "Activity Watch"}, "product_version": "0.11.0 <0.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "18cbfb0e-749f-39f4-82fd-0e806ceaaee2", "vendor": {"name": "ActivityWatch"}}], "isExploited": false}
