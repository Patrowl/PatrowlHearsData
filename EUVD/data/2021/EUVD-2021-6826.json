This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied XML input for the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading crafted XML configuration files that contain scripting code to a vulnerable device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. An attacker would need a valid user account with the rights to upload configuration files to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:35:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:07:24", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-scr-web-priv-esc-k3HCGJZ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1359"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5133cabc-9890-3a48-85a5-e530e345176f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd082f7d-fdec-3c83-bb74-33e1bb64844a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
