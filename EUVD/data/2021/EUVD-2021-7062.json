These vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of certain LLDP packets at ingress time. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to continuously consume memory, which could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:35:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:07:04", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcamera-lldp-mem-wGqundTq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1595"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3136bcb6-b560-3f02-ab52-a1befaf24374", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e166d8d0-f8af-34e4-9e3d-23cda7315a6d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
