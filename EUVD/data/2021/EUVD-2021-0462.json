{"id": "EUVD-2021-0462", "enisaUuid": "f2ad65e1-edc6-3400-8186-78bc46c53c1e", "description": "Wagtail is a Django content management system. In affected versions of Wagtail, when saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface, Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin. See referenced GitHub advisory for additional details, including a workaround. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.11.7 (for the LTS 2.11 branch) and Wagtail 2.12.4 (for the current 2.12 branch).", "datePublished": "2021-04-19T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-04-29T14:24:00", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-wq5h-f9p5-q7fx", "https://pypi.org/project/wagtail/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29434", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/5c7a60977cba478f6a35390ba98cffc2bd41c8a4", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/915f6ed2bd7d53154103cc4424a0f18695cdad6c", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/wagtail/PYSEC-2021-114.yaml", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/compare/v2.11.6...v2.11.7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29434", "GHSA-wq5h-f9p5-q7fx", "PYSEC-2021-114"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "af60e476-8e53-39d8-94d3-aa4d56c2df71", "product": {"name": "wagtail"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.11.6"}, {"id": "df7e37e6-3d58-3cef-a496-8124759693df", "product": {"name": "wagtail"}, "product_version": "2.12, \u2264 2.12.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "14ce243e-83de-397d-9eca-a25205cb2e60", "vendor": {"name": "wagtail"}}], "isExploited": false}
