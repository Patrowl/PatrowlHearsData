The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.", "datePublished": "2021-05-26T21:42:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:30", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32614", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1959911"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32614"], "assigner": "fedora", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "90943b26-22e9-349d-af1d-16204d4ed0a9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
