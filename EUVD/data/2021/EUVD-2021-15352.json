While these are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices. On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694). On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware, the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped (CVE-2021-28695). Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to anymore (CVE-2021-28696).", "datePublished": "2021-08-27T18:46:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28695.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4977", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-28695.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-378.txt", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/6", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LPRVHW4J4ZCPPOHZEWP5MOJT7XDGFFPJ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FZCNPSRPGFCQRYE2BI4D4Q4SCE56ANV2/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VQCFAPBNGBBAOMJZG6QBREOG5IIDZID/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28695"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3e164195-56d3-39d6-996b-575bed51b5a3", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.11.x"}, {"id": "552b6557-84d9-3232-8c80-13b4b61a0ff9", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.13.x"}, {"id": "83a78508-2b6d-3666-9781-c7f2f05ec7a4", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "xen-unstable"}, {"id": "84f14eaa-0e86-3c5f-ae5c-3f1c14b50433", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.14.x"}, {"id": "94a28233-4a2a-3905-b243-2c4f445b458d", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.15.x"}, {"id": "dc500a8d-81e1-33ed-90c2-b030b6c1e618", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.12.x"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f3612f37-60b7-35ac-9f2a-5723fe2ee6e0", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
