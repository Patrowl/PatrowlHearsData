This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading files to the device and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the device to an operational state.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T17:31:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:22:59", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fdm-dos-nFES8xTN"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1489"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "edcccabe-9095-31c0-811b-ee5571594296", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "37cd8d38-f09d-37b3-9825-3f6bf7478bb5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
