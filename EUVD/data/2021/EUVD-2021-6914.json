This vulnerability is due to a procedural flaw in the password generation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling specific Administrator-only features and connecting to the appliance through the CLI with elevated privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid Administrator credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-05-06T12:40:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:21:18", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-priv-esc-JJ8zxQsC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1447"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c6c88c62-e699-34ce-9be1-5fc64edc28d1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70957346-69ac-3b0b-b595-c2d52db84a94", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
