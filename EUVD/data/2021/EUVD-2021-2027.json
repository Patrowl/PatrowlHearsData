In affected versions the documentation of remark-html has mentioned that it was safe by default. In practice the default was never safe and had to be opted into. That is, user input was not sanitized. This means arbitrary HTML can be passed through leading to potential XSS attacks. The problem has been patched in 13.0.2 and 14.0.1: `remark-html` is now safe by default, and the implementation matches the documentation. On older affected versions, pass `sanitize: true` if you cannot update.", "datePublished": "2021-09-07T18:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html/security/advisories/GHSA-9q5w-79cv-947m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39199", "https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html/commit/b75c9dde582ad87ba498e369c033dc8a350478c1", "https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html", "https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html/releases/tag/14.0.1", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39199", "GHSA-9q5w-79cv-947m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12fa1a7d-d3d7-30d4-8525-da87ae87a2fc", "product": {"name": "remark-html"}, "product_version": "14.0.0, < 14.0.1"}, {"id": "8aef312a-c8a5-348d-9275-4b08c319bc50", "product": {"name": "remark-html"}, "product_version": "< 13.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4dda2285-ccf6-3bfb-a985-fb1533cb2661", "vendor": {"name": "remarkjs"}}], "isExploited": false}
