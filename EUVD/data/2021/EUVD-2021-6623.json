The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:37:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:42:07", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-LPTQ3EQC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1156"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3064250a-efb7-3f30-a850-634f4790ee5b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "928aa919-a89a-384c-a18d-97d90e784655", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
