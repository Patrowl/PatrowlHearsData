In OneDev before version 4.0.3, the application's BasePage registers an AJAX event listener (`AbstractPostAjaxBehavior`) in all pages other than the login page. This listener decodes and deserializes the `data` query parameter. We can access this listener by submitting a POST request to any page. This issue may lead to `post-auth RCE` This endpoint is subject to authentication and, therefore, requires a valid user to carry on the attack. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by encrypting serialization payload with secrets only known to server.", "datePublished": "2021-01-15T20:10:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:14", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/theonedev/onedev/security/advisories/GHSA-6pxf-75cf-vwjp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21247"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2949a0a6-1e2b-38fb-8855-52e0e52605e1", "product": {"name": "onedev"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de62c89c-b74a-3ef9-be97-9c848ac086ba", "vendor": {"name": "theonedev"}}], "isExploited": false}
