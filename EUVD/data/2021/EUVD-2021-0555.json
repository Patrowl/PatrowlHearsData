In angular-expressions before version 1.1.2 there is a vulnerability which allows Remote Code Execution if you call \"expressions.compile(userControlledInput)\" where \"userControlledInput\" is text that comes from user input. The security of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload, using a \".constructor.constructor\" technique. In terms of impact: If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput). If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution. This is fixed in version 1.1.2 of angular-expressions A temporary workaround might be either to disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application or allow only following characters in the userControlledInput.", "datePublished": "2021-02-01T15:05:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/security/advisories/GHSA-j6px-jwvv-vpwq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21277", "https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/commit/07edb62902b1f6127b3dcc013da61c6316dd0bf1", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-expressions", "http://blog.angularjs.org/2016/09/angular-16-expression-sandbox-removal.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21277", "GHSA-j6px-jwvv-vpwq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eca7948c-ddb7-37d1-9642-03286810298b", "product": {"name": "angular-expressions"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b271714b-5bd1-3198-b03b-e48d38faf468", "vendor": {"name": "peerigon"}}], "isExploited": false}
