Users should update to 0.9.1, which addresses this issue. However, in order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to actively connect to a mallicious device which could send a response with invalid content. Currently we consider the probability of this being exploited as quite minimal, however this could change in the future, especially with the industrial networks growing more and more together.", "datePublished": "2021-12-19T08:25:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:47:13", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread/jxx6qc84z60xbbhn6vp2s5qf09psrtc7", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/20/2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43083"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 2.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c95b7738-1033-3484-8897-d7fa34247833", "product": {"name": "Apache PLC4X"}, "product_version": "PLC4C \u22640.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "216d127d-ac34-335c-af50-cc9f6d93b1d2", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
