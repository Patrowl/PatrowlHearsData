The vulnerability is due to an incomplete validation of the X.509 certificate used when establishing a connection between DNA Center and an ISE server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted certificate and could then intercept communications between the ISE and DNA Center. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and alter sensitive information that the ISE maintains about clients that are connected to the network.", "datePublished": "2021-06-29T03:05:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:07:44", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-certvalid-USEj2CZk"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1134"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4711f05-3ec0-3471-9420-e788efc09739", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9655d1f0-4980-3197-980f-cab31648acf1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
