This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-09-02T03:05:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:01:34", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-4HnZFewr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34759"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e3be1801-83f7-368d-b376-025ebc20f9ed", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d9429ad-4d36-339e-a165-1a3386ca2d3f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
