In affected versions envoy\u2019s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset. Deployments are susceptible to Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on H/2 concurrent streams. An attacker wishing to exploit this vulnerability would require a client opening and closing a large number of H/2 streams. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams. As a workaround users may limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 dreams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 100.", "datePublished": "2021-08-24T20:30:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32778.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2021:4051", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32778", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-32778.html", "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/version_history/version_history", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-3xh3-33v5-chcc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32778"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3371dea0-5f9c-3fd4-b94e-1a419ee35a8c", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.16.0, < 1.16.5"}, {"id": "510627e1-30bf-3b64-85c4-a96cdafd856e", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.17.0, < 1.17.4"}, {"id": "b3a811aa-c3c5-3a8d-9163-79263d183802", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.18.0, < 1.18.4"}, {"id": "d1b5f9c2-a974-317a-bd8b-5572a49e81fb", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.19.0, < 1.19.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "764831af-782d-332c-b0fc-2da021e539da", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
