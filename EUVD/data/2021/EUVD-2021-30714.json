{"id": "EUVD-2021-30714", "enisaUuid": "7fdb82bd-7ee3-334a-b673-a08537f91d8d", "description": "Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258.", "datePublished": "2021-12-20T22:30:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:10:16", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-3qv4-gp35-rgh7", "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718", "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/tag/2.5.260"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43842"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12c58ad9-3571-3a9f-a166-425a24a59978", "product": {"name": "wiki"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.260 (production)"}, {"id": "dc1ee86e-8cec-3bd2-b70b-1e55c5e3a7f7", "product": {"name": "wiki"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.258 (development)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "27ca4381-4f38-3609-b5c2-404319703176", "vendor": {"name": "Requarks"}}], "isExploited": false}
