An attacker (with a foothold in a endpoint via a low-privileged user account) can access the exposed RPC service of the update service component. This RPC functionality allows the attacker to interact with the RPC functionality and execute code from a path of his choice (local, or remote via SMB) because of a TOCTOU race condition. This code execution is in the context of the Plex update service (which runs as SYSTEM).", "datePublished": "2021-12-08T14:34:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:38:50", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/", "https://bugsec.com/experts_teams/", "https://ir-on.io/2021/12/02/local-privilege-plexcalation/", "https://forums.plex.tv/t/security-regarding-cve-2021-42835/761510"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-42835"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 16.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "15fec4d9-d251-3de3-96d3-b742f50c7b1e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a077064-74c8-3911-a5d1-147c117d91a4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
