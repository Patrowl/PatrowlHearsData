The vulnerability is due to inadequate provisioning of kernel parameters for the maximum number of TCP connections and SYN backlog. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports that are used by the health monitor API. This vulnerability only affects customers who use the health monitor API.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T20:01:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:20:59", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esc-dos-4Gw6D527"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1312"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "41a9b4b0-c863-3a84-b156-5911c1284609", "product": {"name": "Cisco Elastic Services Controller"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5d449009-1059-39ad-9e89-9ec86b62829d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
