{"id": "EUVD-2021-8642", "enisaUuid": "2893fec3-2c49-3ca7-bd9c-5c63ad73d2ca", "description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.", "datePublished": "2021-01-14T19:40:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:14", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-21261.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4830", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0411", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0307", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0306", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0304", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-21261", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-21261.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-21261", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-21261.html", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppf-fxf6-vxg2", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/1.8.5", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6d1773d2a54dde9b099043f07a2094a4f1c2f486", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6e5ae7a109cdfa9735ea7ccbd8cb79f9e8d3ae8b", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/aeb6a7ab0abaac4a8f4ad98b3df476d9de6b8bd4", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/cc1401043c075268ecc652eac557ef8076b5eaba", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-21"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21261"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "145065a8-db6b-30ac-ab55-b6c844df35bf", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.9.0, < 1.10.0"}, {"id": "b71512a1-568c-3270-9258-83322f31576f", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "0.11.4, < 1.8.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a5eac58-5ce6-3bd0-9acf-7312f141b773", "vendor": {"name": "flatpak"}}], "isExploited": false}
