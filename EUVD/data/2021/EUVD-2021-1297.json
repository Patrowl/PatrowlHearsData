Versions before and including `1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error message. You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are using custom error handling that does not return the error message in an HTML response. Upgrade to version `1.4.1` to resolve. The fix adds basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your users.", "datePublished": "2021-06-25T16:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-954c-jjx6-cxv7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32702", "https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/commit/6996e2528ceed98627caa28abafbc09e90163ccf", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@auth0/nextjs-auth0", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40auth0/nextjs-auth0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32702", "GHSA-954c-jjx6-cxv7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d7506aa-d38d-30e0-b957-8a7e3665bdde", "product": {"name": "nextjs-auth0"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2eb60531-08da-32f5-8214-6bc761f97a21", "vendor": {"name": "auth0"}}], "isExploited": false}
