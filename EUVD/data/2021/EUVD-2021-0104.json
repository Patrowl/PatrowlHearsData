When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed. One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade occurs.", "datePublished": "2021-10-28T20:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-11-03T14:26:52", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-5xvc-vgmp-jgc3", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41194", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38/commits/32b21898fb2b53b1a2e36270de6854ad70e9e9bf", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38/commits/9e200d974e0cb85d828a6afedb8ab90a37878f28", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/commit/953418e2450dbc2d854e332350849533b0ebc7ba", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator/PYSEC-2021-384.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41194", "GHSA-5xvc-vgmp-jgc3", "PYSEC-2021-384"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e590d3f3-5311-3de3-a930-ac9e69349ec4", "product": {"name": "firstuseauthenticator"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2138d75c-90bc-33c0-99a1-4f9548278c13", "vendor": {"name": "jupyterhub"}}], "isExploited": false}
