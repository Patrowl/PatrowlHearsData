The impact of this vulnerability is that the security ACL drop rule might be bypassed if a NAT ACL rule filter with permit action matches the packet flow. This could allow a host with an IP address in a range that matches the range allowed by a NAT ACL and a range denied by a Security ACL to be forwarded incorrectly as it should have been denied by the Security ACL. This can enable an ACL bypass.", "datePublished": "2022-08-05T16:47:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:15:30", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.arista.com/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/15862-security-advisory-0078"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28511"], "assigner": "Arista", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6461ebc5-aeda-3a8c-b850-fd8137e7f3c8", "product": {"name": "EOS"}, "product_version": "4.25.0 \u22644.25.8"}, {"id": "6da5c1f3-0fce-33bd-a880-441e7871df58", "product": {"name": "EOS"}, "product_version": "4.26.0 \u22644.26.5"}, {"id": "adc58fec-c2e7-39ab-8c24-e628a997160d", "product": {"name": "EOS"}, "product_version": "4.24.0 \u22644.24.9"}, {"id": "efa05e1a-360e-3553-8ef1-bcdcc561c1cf", "product": {"name": "EOS"}, "product_version": "4.27.0 \u22644.27.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ed321ec-b1cf-33b5-b3da-13f830023193", "vendor": {"name": "Arista Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
