This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as a user with root-level privileges.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T15:35:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:43:34", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbrv-cmdinjection-Z5cWFdK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40120"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bdf83a18-88a7-3ed7-b577-d1333ae51982", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "72b4494d-56ce-31cf-ac17-c416405ca16e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
