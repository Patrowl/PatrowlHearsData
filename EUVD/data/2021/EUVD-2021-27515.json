This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the user\u2019s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.", "datePublished": "2022-07-25T14:34:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T02:58:14", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=8DBD000085&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40336"], "assigner": "Hitachi Energy", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aff06473-1c59-300d-996c-20b28a7df68b", "product": {"name": "MSM"}, "product_version": "v2.2 \u2264V2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1a86876f-7e94-3306-ac0f-6dfced597528", "vendor": {"name": "Hitachi Energy"}}], "isExploited": false}
