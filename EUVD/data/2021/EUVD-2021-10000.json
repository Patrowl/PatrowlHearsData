To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application through the web authentication flow. The private repository metadata returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.0.4 and was fixed in versions 3.0.4, 2.22.10, 2.21.18. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.", "datePublished": "2021-04-02T17:25:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:51:07", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.4", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.10", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/admin/release-notes#2.21.18", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%403.0/admin/release-notes#3.0.4", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.10", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.21/admin/release-notes#2.21.18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22865"], "assigner": "GitHub_P", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "90c22003-b1fa-3a0c-81ab-5a2c1f56e7c4", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2.22 <2.22.10"}, {"id": "cfab1ea0-bb90-3cb1-a8bd-1f50a06ecf42", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "3.0 <3.0.4"}, {"id": "e08475be-eb66-313c-8e0a-af6254179581", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2.21 <2.21.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da3cc293-1470-399c-bad6-1ee939cdf706", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
