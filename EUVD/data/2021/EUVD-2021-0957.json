Specially crafted Host headers in combination with certain \"allowed host\" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website. This is similar to CVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not have a leading dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This causes, for example, `config.hosts << \"sub.example.com\"` to permit a request with a Host header value of `sub-example.com`.", "datePublished": "2021-06-11T15:49:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:58:25", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-22903", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1148025", "https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/cve-2021-22903-possible-open-redirect-vulnerability-in-action-pack/77867", "https://github.com/rails/rails/releases/tag/v6.1.3.2", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/actionpack/CVE-2021-22903.yml", "https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/8TxqXEtgSF0", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-22903.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-22903"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22903", "GHSA-5hq2-xf89-9jxq"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "501eaaec-4e0c-339c-9ed4-779fb07c1e87", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
