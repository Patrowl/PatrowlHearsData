This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that doesn't parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\". The flaw exists in all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc` v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version 0.14.10. Two workarounds exist: One may reject requests manually that contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header or ensure any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign prefix.", "datePublished": "2021-07-07T20:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/security/advisories/GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32715", "https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/28826/commits/123a83326fb95366e94a3be1a74775df4db97739", "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/1fb719e0b61a4f3d911562a436a2ff05fd7cb759", "https://github.com/hyperium/hyper", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0078.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32715.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32715", "GHSA-f3pg-qwvg-p99c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1349351d-adf4-3f3e-9945-77a3ae4613c3", "product": {"name": "hyper"}, "product_version": "< 0.14.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53c3801a-326c-382d-ba96-ccc80e9ca534", "vendor": {"name": "hyperium"}}], "isExploited": false}
