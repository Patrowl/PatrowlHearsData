It could occur when the descriptor's address belongs to the non direct access region, due to num_buffers being set after the virtqueue elem has been unmapped. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash QEMU, resulting in a denial of service condition, or potentially execute code on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process.", "datePublished": "2022-03-23T19:46:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:09:08", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3748.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4980", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:5036", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4112", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3748", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3748", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3748.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1759", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1998514", "https://github.com/qemu/qemu/commit/bedd7e93d01961fcb16a97ae45d93acf357e11f6", "https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2021-09/msg00388.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00002.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220425-0004/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-27", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00008.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3748"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3cbc7ab6-05bd-3e99-a865-3b1f2f78ec60", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
