This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-06-16T17:45:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:07:50", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cuic-xss-csHUdtrL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1395"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "667608b2-e51a-3637-ab55-5d30dfc4a7bd", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5fa14aae-8594-30e5-9bc6-12e0c41c084e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
