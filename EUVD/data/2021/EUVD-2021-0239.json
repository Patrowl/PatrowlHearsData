If you use `HttpAuthMiddleware` (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target. This includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects. Upgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials. If you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead. If you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the `w3lib.http.basic_auth_header` function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using `HttpAuthMiddleware`.", "datePublished": "2021-10-06T18:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-10-11T01:16:42", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/b01d69a1bf48060daec8f751368622352d8b85a6", "https://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/w3lib.html#w3lib.http.basic_auth_header", "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/security/advisories/GHSA-jwqp-28gf-p498", "http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41125", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/scrapy/PYSEC-2021-363.yaml", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00021.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41125.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-41125"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41125", "GHSA-jwqp-28gf-p498", "PYSEC-2021-363"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bd39bc1b-3e62-38df-ba42-36e0fd6998b0", "product": {"name": "scrapy"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.5.1"}, {"id": "f8f4e1a5-3e2c-315e-ab20-9e3eb98f9f50", "product": {"name": "scrapy"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "91781a15-aaa5-3088-b066-4bc9eb4437a0", "vendor": {"name": "scrapy"}}], "isExploited": false}
