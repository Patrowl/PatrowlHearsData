{"id": "EUVD-2021-6889", "enisaUuid": "2958c0ad-fdc7-3e8e-b8ed-4f814c46c237", "description": "A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker or an unauthenticated attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection. A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload. Important: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not cause a compromise of any encrypted data. Note: This vulnerability affects only Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.1 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.0.0.", "datePublished": "2021-07-16T12:25:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:06:04", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ipsec-dos-TFKQbgWC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1422"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9cca6a3e-339c-395d-af39-03f698cd6bfd", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da517945-464b-305c-b070-099c60052f81", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
