The issue occurs because while writing an interrupt ID to the controller memory area, it is not masked to be 4 bits wide. It may lead to the said issue while updating controller state fields and their subsequent processing. A privileged guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.", "datePublished": "2021-05-13T15:34:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:30:07", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-20221.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3061", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2521", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1125", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-20221", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-20221", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-20221.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/05/1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00024.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1924601", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210708-0005/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/09/msg00008.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20221"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a8f7eda-a485-33d4-9461-ded6114449cc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
