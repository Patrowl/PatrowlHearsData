This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T15:40:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:42:41", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cpar-strd-xss-A4DCVETG"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34731"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a2a0d40c-b948-3489-acdc-8a45427847ea", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Access Registrar"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7bf6f891-603a-39ac-a464-bf3cb2eaedd7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
