A read of uninitialized memory was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The read of uninitialized memory is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.", "datePublished": "2021-05-13T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:06", "baseScore": 3.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29623.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4173", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-29623", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-29623.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29623", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-6253-qjwm-3q4v", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1627", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5I3RRZUGSBIUYZ5TIHLN55PKMAWCSJ5G/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M2BPQNJKTRIDINTVJ22QMMTIZEPHVKXK/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQAKFIQHW2AS3AGSJM42ABOA6CWIJBGM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TZ5SGWHK64TB7ADRSVBGHEPDFN5CSOO3/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29623"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5b184a82-ba0b-38c5-94c5-cb7fbfe74781", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "< v0.27.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "76c5f01c-375e-3c7f-8351-4d27bde5d1bc", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
