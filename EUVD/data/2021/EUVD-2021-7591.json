Subsequent log messages will be appended to the file, prefixed by a timestamp and some logging metadata. Remote code execution can be achieved by using this vulnerability to append to a shell script on the router's filesystem, and then awaiting or triggering the execution of that script. A remote, unauthenticated root shell can easily be obtained on the device in this fashion.", "datePublished": "2021-12-30T21:31:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:30:07", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-44"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20134"], "assigner": "tenable", "epss": 1.09, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7a2517e5-05b1-3c05-ac76-0dc5c1dd7843", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
