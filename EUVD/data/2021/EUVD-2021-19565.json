{"id": "EUVD-2021-19565", "enisaUuid": "e313c58d-ef96-3380-89a1-387f3767fda5", "description": "Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The assertion failure is triggered when Exiv2 is used to modify the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when modifying the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`. ### Patches The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5. ### References Regression test and bug fix: #1739 ### For more information Please see our [security policy](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/policy) for information about Exiv2 security.", "datePublished": "2021-08-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T14:12:57", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32815.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-32815", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-32815.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32815", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-mv9g-fxh2-m49m", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/1739", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FMDT4PJB7P43WSOM3TRQIY3J33BAFVVE/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UYGDELIFFJWKUU7SO3QATCIXCZJERGAC/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00004.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32815"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3bb07374-86cc-3001-80cf-918df3e0f71f", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "< 0.27.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "85d7f039-24aa-3573-8f2e-3b982f880feb", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
