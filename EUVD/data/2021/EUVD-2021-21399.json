This vulnerability is due to inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the SSL client hello packet to communicate with an external server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute a command-and-control attack on a compromised host and perform additional data exfiltration attacks.", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T19:40:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:03:41", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5354", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sni-data-exfil-mFgzXqLN", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00011.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34749"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b69256e6-ae79-3e22-b179-c9f37e97ebe8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "820fa978-1a86-3bb0-8782-54001eaefc5f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
