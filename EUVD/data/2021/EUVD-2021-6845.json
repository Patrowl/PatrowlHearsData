The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-02-17T16:55:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:41:07", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-StarOS-DoS-RLLvGFJj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1378"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f6e44a8-01ac-3764-9392-2e98c289ccf6", "product": {"name": "Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6b621307-e2b1-3bf6-9438-58ed8278d9fe", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
