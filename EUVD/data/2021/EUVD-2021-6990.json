This could result in one or more leaf switches being removed from the fabric. This vulnerability is due to mishandling of ingress TCP traffic to a specific port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of TCP packets to a specific port on a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) configured on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a specific packet queue to queue network buffers but never process them, leading to an eventual queue wedge. This could cause control plane traffic to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition where the leaf switches are unavailable. Note: This vulnerability requires a manual intervention to power-cycle the device to recover.", "datePublished": "2021-08-25T19:10:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:03:29", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n9kaci-queue-wedge-cLDDEfKF"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1523"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ba63acf-dbe4-3270-8247-eaf4407bc870", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "98a643d7-3b85-319f-a3f6-75cefb5a7f62", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
