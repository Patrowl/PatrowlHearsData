Running processes in container builds (e.g. Dockerfile RUN commands) can access environment variables from parent and grandparent processes. When run in a container in a CI/CD environment, environment variables may include sensitive information that was shared with the container in order to be used only by Buildah itself (e.g. container registry credentials).", "datePublished": "2022-03-03T18:26:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:01:08", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/containers/buildah/security/advisories/GHSA-7638-r9r3-rmjj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3602", "https://github.com/containers/buildah/commit/a468ce0ffd347035d53ee0e26c205ef604097fb0", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1969264", "https://github.com/containers/buildah", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0345", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3602", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3602.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4222", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4221", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4154", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-3602.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3602", "GHSA-7638-r9r3-rmjj"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f9841f1-5602-3b6f-a5e1-8be49d91bda0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
