An attacker could craft and host a block containing malicious JavaScript on a server they controlled, and then use it to overwrite any post or page by sending an AJAX request with the action set to astra-page-elementor-batch-process and the url parameter pointed to their remotely-hosted malicious block, as well as an id parameter containing the post or page to overwrite. Any post or page that had been built with Elementor, including published pages, could be overwritten by the imported block, and the malicious JavaScript in the imported block would then be executed in the browser of any visitors to that page.", "datePublished": "2021-11-17T17:45:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-14T17:51:59", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/11/over-1-million-sites-impacted-by-vulnerability-in-starter-templates-plugin/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-42360"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "54b1e45e-618b-3bdb-b2df-a9032a82e58f", "product": {"name": "Starter Templates \u2014 Elementor, Gutenberg & Beaver Builder Templates"}, "product_version": "2.7.0 \u22642.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "191b6778-6a3b-3fe7-95f6-917ba82883f3", "vendor": {"name": "brainstormforce"}}], "isExploited": false}
