The vulnerability is due to improper memory resource management while the Snort detection engine is processing ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of ICMP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device, causing the device to reload.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:56:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:43:47", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5354", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-dos-s2R7W9UU", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00011.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40114"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b3839210-3aa8-3679-baa1-d66768c976a2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "43c4cc37-2ae5-3d71-9b45-61c01b731a18", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
