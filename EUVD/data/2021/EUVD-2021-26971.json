When collections are built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in \"galaxy.yml\" include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info, such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.", "datePublished": "2022-04-18T16:20:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:01:07", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3681.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3681", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1989407", "https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues/1977"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3681"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "88948a04-dfac-30ea-9b92-7fe85cf36a0d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
