We assume that the USB splitter supplies power to some speakers. The power indicator LED of the USB splitter is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of the USB splitter's power indicator LED is correlative to its power consumption. The sound played by the connected speakers affects the USB splitter's power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LED. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the USB splitter, we can recover the sound played by the connected speakers.", "datePublished": "2021-08-11T15:26:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:44:23", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nassiben.com/glowworm-attack"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38543"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "151cc3e8-8f2e-3614-abcc-4bc99ff5ed25", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "52c6aea3-56a4-395c-9070-bff682195822", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
