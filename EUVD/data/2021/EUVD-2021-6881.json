These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device.", "datePublished": "2021-04-08T04:06:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:27:54", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv34x-rce-8bfG2h6b", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-559/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1414"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55ebf2ac-2673-3c90-8055-45a4373a522f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c90117f7-d102-3270-a372-baa5bb1aba2a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
