Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of this condition being triggered.", "datePublished": "2021-09-09T22:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j374-mjrw-vvp8", "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/security/advisories/GHSA-gjcg-vrxg-xmgv", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39162", "https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium", "https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/5xBpsEZZDfE/m/wD05NZBbAgAJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39162", "GHSA-gjcg-vrxg-xmgv"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ee7586b-0df0-3929-adf3-f7fba316c4d5", "product": {"name": "pomerium"}, "product_version": "0.15.0, < 0.15.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de96999a-1bef-32f0-83e6-977747d46861", "vendor": {"name": "pomerium"}}], "isExploited": false}
