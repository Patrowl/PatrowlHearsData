These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-02-04T16:40:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:51:43", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-overflow-ghZP68yj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1347"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e98e1eff-20e9-3eda-961d-621caf094a82", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "46eb910b-2d79-3e1e-8e3b-0d2646ad130e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
