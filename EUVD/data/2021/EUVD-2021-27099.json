The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.", "datePublished": "2022-08-26T15:25:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:09:09", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3864.html", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/20/2", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015046", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3864", "https://lore.kernel.org/all/20211221021744.864115-1-longman%40redhat.com/", "https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211228170910.623156-1-wander%40redhat.com/", "https://lore.kernel.org/all/20211226150310.GA992%401wt.eu/", "https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-3864"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3864"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2b51cc71-cfcf-3802-8d6c-18b50d1e3b94", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
