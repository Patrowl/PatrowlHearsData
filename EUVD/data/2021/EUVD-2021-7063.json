{"id": "EUVD-2021-7063", "enisaUuid": "dc80d6a7-6430-3e14-8b60-bda9b23ee9be", "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of certain LLDP packets at ingress time. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to continuously consume memory, which could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:35:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:06:57", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcamera-lldp-mem-wGqundTq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1596"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e12c4035-8218-37ff-a6eb-009c32ca9db3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d0ed52ad-5fa4-3cad-9493-f6338673dc83", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
