This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters in a specific HTTP request by an attacker. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an authenticated user of the DCNM web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to the Device Manager application, which provides access to network devices managed by the system.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T19:56:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:24:20", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-ssrf-F2vX6q5p"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1272"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "063d287f-4eb8-3b42-bd24-61aaa26c4ff0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d4746bf-b03d-37b9-95bc-93881fcb7296", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
