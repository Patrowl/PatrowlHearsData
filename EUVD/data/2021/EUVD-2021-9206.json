The full path to the command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects Windows installers.", "datePublished": "2021-10-29T11:09:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:30:24", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://blog.installbuilder.com/2021/10/installbuilder-2160-released.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-22037"], "assigner": "vmware", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f53880f-b2ff-3539-9a49-96c6013a110e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
