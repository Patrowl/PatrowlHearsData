Versions of Opencast prior to 9.6 are vulnerable to the billion laughs attack, which allows an attacker to easily execute a (seemingly permanent) denial of service attack, essentially taking down Opencast using a single HTTP request. To exploit this, users need to have ingest privileges, limiting the group of potential attackers The problem has been fixed in Opencast 9.6. There is no known workaround for this issue.", "datePublished": "2021-06-15T23:45:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:30", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-9gwx-9cwp-5c2m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32623", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/16b0d641713fe31b8518fcf14fc5e4e815d81206", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/8ae27da5a6f658011a5741b3210e715b0dc6213e", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32623", "GHSA-9gwx-9cwp-5c2m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58604e46-9ed0-3a21-8db1-a6eb9b50ff9d", "product": {"name": "opencast"}, "product_version": "< 9.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7db8b10f-9285-3d77-9918-377dfe6fa1b5", "vendor": {"name": "opencast"}}], "isExploited": false}
