This bypasses the restrictions imposed on users who do not have the permission to post `unfiltered_html`. ### Patches This has been patched in WordPress 5.8, and will be pushed to older versions via minor releases (automatic updates). It's strongly recommended that you keep auto-updates enabled to receive the fix. ### References https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/ https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)", "datePublished": "2021-09-09T21:35:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4985", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1142140", "https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/security/advisories/GHSA-wh69-25hr-h94v"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39201"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a02a9bf-6c74-3745-89c4-02fbce830a85", "product": {"name": "wordpress-develop"}, "product_version": "5.0, < 5.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "adafd9da-7a6b-376b-8698-58dfe6d996a9", "vendor": {"name": "WordPress"}}], "isExploited": false}
