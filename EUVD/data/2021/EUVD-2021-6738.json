The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T19:57:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:23:57", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wsa-xss-RuB5WGqL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1271"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cdef8d12-286d-3a7c-9411-01c24774c630", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eb7b0676-5b52-3562-8139-e94f871835c2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
