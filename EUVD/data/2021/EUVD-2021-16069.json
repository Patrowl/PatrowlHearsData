Grassroot Platform before master deployment as of 2021-04-16 did not properly verify the signature of JSON Web Tokens when refreshing an existing JWT. This allows to forge a valid JWT. The problem has been patched in version 1.3.1 by deprecating the JWT refresh function, which was an overdue deprecation regardless (the \"refresh\" flow is no longer used).", "datePublished": "2021-04-19T19:05:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:02:51", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-f65w-6xw8-6734", "https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/", "https://github.com/grassrootza/grassroot-platform/commit/a2e6e885f8183a066d938cf909fd813a7af7d67f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29455"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "355cb6b0-7986-3e42-a796-dd4e10f19962", "product": {"name": "grassroot-platform"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "026ad79a-7db9-3da4-9ceb-7d19cd866d09", "vendor": {"name": "grassrootza"}}], "isExploited": false}
