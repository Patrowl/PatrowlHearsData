The vulnerability exists because the affected software mishandles character rendering. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sharing a file within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify how the shared file name displays within the interface, which could allow the attacker to conduct phishing or spoofing attacks.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:17:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:47:40", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-teams-7ZMcXG99"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1242"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4a835aa-8a6b-34ad-9ad4-c789cecbff2a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Teams"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9bd1dfe-2872-3752-889f-18e4be69dc84", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
