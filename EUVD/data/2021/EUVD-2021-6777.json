This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website, bypassing the Webex URL check that should result in a warning before the redirection to the web page. Attackers may use this type of vulnerability, known as an open redirect attack, as part of a phishing attack to convince users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:46:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T04:15:17", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-open-redirect-PWvBQ2q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1310"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2107e97-7686-3da5-87b4-64c283dcb6fd", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "91306a5f-e779-3907-b048-1865ce1cb255", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
