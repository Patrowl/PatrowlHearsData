This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:30:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:07:36", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vvb-xss-wG4zXRp3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1575"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7623dbf8-d25c-3eb5-a911-5ce23de63af9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "29295d44-4019-3af5-aae9-c0d5cbaefc45", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
