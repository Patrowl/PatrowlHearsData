{"id": "EUVD-2021-24959", "enisaUuid": "0a76af8e-996a-3a4e-803d-6d7b212ac291", "description": "The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP. This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature, which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.", "datePublished": "2021-12-08T21:21:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:44:23", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-38507.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5034", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5026", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4607", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4605", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4134", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4133", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4132", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4130", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4123", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4116", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-38507", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-38507.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-38507", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-38507.html", "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2021-49/", "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2021-50/", "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2021-48/", "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1730935", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00030.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/01/msg00001.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202202-03", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-14"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38507"], "assigner": "mozilla", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "956ffb18-4cc2-3952-9ea0-6eda32186701", "product": {"name": "Firefox ESR"}, "product_version": "unspecified <91.3"}, {"id": "d2087ea3-b91f-3f48-b9d3-fd68d0cb0bae", "product": {"name": "Thunderbird"}, "product_version": "unspecified <91.3"}, {"id": "e8b809e5-2e60-3ba8-85b3-410965f4ebab", "product": {"name": "Firefox"}, "product_version": "unspecified <94"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7325a315-a65d-3b7b-b970-d7ecb8be14b3", "vendor": {"name": "Mozilla"}}], "isExploited": false}
