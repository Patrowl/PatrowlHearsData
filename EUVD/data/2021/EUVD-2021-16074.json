An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.", "datePublished": "2021-04-30T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-15T17:14:39", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29463.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4173", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-29463", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-29463.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29463", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-5p8g-9xf3-gfrr", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/commit/783b3a6ff15ed6f82a8f8e6c8a6f3b84a9b04d4b", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDMZTVQAZSMLPTDVDYLBHAAF7I5QXVYQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/K3HKXR6JOVKMBE4HY4FDXNVZGNCQG6T3/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29463"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb101d47-9a6c-3b3d-80f9-2c29d504f068", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "< 0.27.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70763263-8fc7-3b7b-968b-c1906fb11101", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
