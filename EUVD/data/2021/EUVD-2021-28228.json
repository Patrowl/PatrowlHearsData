In particular, the desired behavior (if .travis.yml has been created locally by a customer, and added to git) is for a Travis service to perform builds in a way that prevents public access to customer-specific secret environment data such as signing keys, access credentials, and API tokens. However, during the stated 8-day interval, secret data could be revealed to an unauthorized actor who forked a public repository and printed files during a build process.", "datePublished": "2021-09-14T15:07:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1437646118700175360", "https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1437649838477283330", "https://blog.travis-ci.com/2021-09-13-bulletin", "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28523350", "https://travis-ci.community/t/security-bulletin/12081", "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28524727"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41077"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "80eba6af-18c7-3569-a3ce-2b67ec1391a4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f8f5d17b-dad8-3bdd-b1aa-53ce6eff7c9f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
