The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks) vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords) as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette 0.57 and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=` or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters.", "datePublished": "2021-06-07T22:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-06-09T05:01:28", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks", "https://pypi.org/project/datasette/", "https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords", "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-xw7c-jx9m-xh5g", "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1360", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gff3-739c-gxfq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32670", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/datasette/PYSEC-2021-89.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32670", "GHSA-xw7c-jx9m-xh5g", "GHSA-gff3-739c-gxfq", "PYSEC-2021-89"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea02f410-76f8-3f0d-9cb9-e52ed19536d7", "product": {"name": "datasette"}, "product_version": "< 0.56.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6be5d895-85aa-3331-84b0-158bbc82c215", "vendor": {"name": "simonw"}}], "isExploited": false}
