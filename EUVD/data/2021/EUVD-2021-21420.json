The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs during the validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-05-24T19:15:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-30T21:30:34", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-capwap-rce-LYgj8Kf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-34770"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34770"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "af02e99e-b548-35d7-96d0-01a35a94ea6d", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "28f2cf19-382b-35e9-964b-bf473efc8660", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
