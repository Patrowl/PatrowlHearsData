An integer overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB).", "datePublished": "2021-06-02T19:35:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:30", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32625.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32625", "https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-46cp-x4x9-6pfq", "https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.0.14", "https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.4", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BHWOF7CBVUGDK3AN6H3BN3VNTH2TDUZZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SN7INTZFE34MIQJO7WDDTIY5LIBGN6GI/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32625"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b788d5c-9c60-3f94-892a-5b6ed4555995", "product": {"name": "Redis"}, "product_version": "< 6.0.14"}, {"id": "79f22aab-7b0c-35a4-ba29-851b71537ddf", "product": {"name": "Redis"}, "product_version": "6.2.0, < 6.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d3dd8a1-50dd-3c30-8b55-dc9c09a60995", "vendor": {"name": "Redis"}}], "isExploited": false}
