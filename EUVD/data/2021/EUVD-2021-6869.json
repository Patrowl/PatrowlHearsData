The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based SSL decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS message through an affected device. SSL/TLS messages sent to an affected device do not trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash. This crash would then trigger a reload of the device. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after the reload.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T17:15:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:25:17", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-ssl-decrypt-dos-DdyLuK6c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1402"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8c2d084-1165-33c5-b6c8-d9e11dbaf78a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d9487c3-1906-3b16-a5f4-070a019c81d6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
