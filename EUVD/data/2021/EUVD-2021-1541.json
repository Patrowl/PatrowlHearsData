In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.", "datePublished": "2021-08-23T18:05:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-3ccq-5vw3-2p6x", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39149", "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/09/msg00017.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210923-0003", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5004", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39149.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-39149.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0520", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0297", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0296", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4918", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4767", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3956", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-39149.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-39149.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-39149", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210923-0003/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39149", "GHSA-3ccq-5vw3-2p6x"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "94881ee1-a25b-34d3-9f17-1d672095ba8b", "product": {"name": "xstream"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fdd52c95-3341-3e05-be2d-3a628ee77a98", "vendor": {"name": "x-stream"}}], "isExploited": false}
