This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain IPv4 TCP traffic that is destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted TCP packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web management interface to become unavailable, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability does not impact traffic that is going through the device or going to the Management Ethernet interface of the device.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:07:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:33:15", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ncs520-tcp-ZpzzOxB"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1394"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f73a178-96a2-395f-9214-3c3421501841", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b246b259-1e3c-3458-b993-ec5333d1a806", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
