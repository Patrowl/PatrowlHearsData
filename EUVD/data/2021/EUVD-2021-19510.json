Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.3.0, the Nextcloud Desktop client fails to check if a private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance serves a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "datePublished": "2021-08-18T16:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:54", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32728.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4974", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-32728.html", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1189162", "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-f5fr-5gcv-6cc5", "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/3338"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32728"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb69fa2f-43fb-3889-9863-f3287140217f", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 3.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "385ea2d6-1c83-34f1-9a12-666512c720e8", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
