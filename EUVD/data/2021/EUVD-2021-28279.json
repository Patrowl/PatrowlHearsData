Prior to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, Nextcloud Server did not implement a database backend for rate-limiting purposes. Any component of Nextcloud using rate-limits (as as `AnonRateThrottle` or `UserRateThrottle`) was thus not rate limited on instances not having a memory cache backend configured. In the case of a default installation, this would notably include the rate-limits on the two factor codes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, or 22.2.0. As a workaround, enable a memory cache backend in `config.php`.", "datePublished": "2021-10-25T21:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41177.html", "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-fj39-4qx4-m3f2", "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28728", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1265709", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-17"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41177"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a9e9646-36c7-3346-a639-a30e15e336fc", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 20.0.13"}, {"id": "a0e5fe1b-9b5c-3dff-ba09-e1502ca35fae", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 22.2.0"}, {"id": "d666449c-41fb-3502-b012-31244d3338bd", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "21.0.0, < 21.0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9eae5944-e972-3cb0-b504-d96ad6b97d93", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
