This issue was fixed in version 2.1.13 of the product. Please note that this issue is ultimately caused by the defaults provided by the Laravel framework, specifically how proxy headers are handled with respect to multi-tenant implementations. In other words, while this is not technically a vulnerability in Laravel, this default configuration is very likely to lead to practically identical identical vulnerabilities in Laravel projects that implement multi-tenant applications.", "datePublished": "2021-08-04T22:20:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:04:02", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36804", "https://github.com/laravel/laravel/pull/5477", "https://github.com/laravel/laravel", "https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/75a7dba9c44ce3555cc57dd1826467839fd9774f/CHANGELOG.md#v844-2020-12-01", "https://www.laravel-enlightn.com/docs/security/host-injection-analyzer.html", "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/07/27/multiple-open-source-web-app-vulnerabilities-fixed", "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/07/27/multiple-open-source-web-app-vulnerabilities-fixed/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-36804", "GHSA-246r-r2wf-frhx"], "assigner": "rapid7", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3222da3b-9367-3d94-88b0-799c684278cb", "product": {"name": "Akaunting"}, "product_version": "2.1.12 \u22642.1.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac5def37-606d-303f-959e-c78e57b93335", "vendor": {"name": "Akaunting"}}], "isExploited": false}
