Those touchpoints can, for example, alter the command-line used to start the application, injecting things like agent or other settings that usually require particular attention in term of security. Although p2 has built-in strategies to ensure artifacts are signed and then to help establish trust, there is no such strategy for the metadata part that does configure such touchpoints. As a result, it's possible to install a unit that will run malicious code during installation without user receiving any warning about this installation step being risky when coming from untrusted source.", "datePublished": "2022-07-08T03:50:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:30", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=577029", "https://github.com/eclipse-equinox/p2/issues/235"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41037"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a2d373f9-cf99-30d5-aa30-3176b35f20ea", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Equinox p2"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <4.28"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d08e15cf-a482-3fe2-b242-18a4a49bf2ab", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
