The power indicator LED of the speakers is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption. The sound played by the speakers affects their power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LEDs. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LEDs of the speakers, we can recover the sound played by them.", "datePublished": "2021-08-11T15:25:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:44:23", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nassiben.com/glowworm-attack"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-38546"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f009c1ca-bc13-3c23-b514-3b30a9465bf3", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "03a98993-4011-3953-8e32-ac20097a9acc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
