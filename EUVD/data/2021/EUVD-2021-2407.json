Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints: Sending a test email and Generating a node auto-deployment token. At no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system. This has been addressed in release `1.6.6`. Users may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.", "datePublished": "2021-11-17T19:30:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:08:31", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41273", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/bf9cbe2c6d5266c6914223e067c56175de7fc3a5", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41273", "GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a9c146ff-043f-3d00-b430-03db3e157e21", "product": {"name": "panel"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d21e2e9-dfdb-35de-bbc8-913a1a40de55", "vendor": {"name": "pterodactyl"}}], "isExploited": false}
