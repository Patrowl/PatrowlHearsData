A path traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.5.9. With a basic configuration, it is possible to access any file from a filesystem, using \"/../../\" in the URL. This occurs because Micronaut does not restrict file access to configured paths. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.5.9. As a workaround, do not use `**` in mapping, use only `*`, which exposes only flat structure of a directory not allowing traversal. If using Linux, another workaround is to run micronaut in chroot.", "datePublished": "2021-07-16T18:25:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cjx7-399x-p2rj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32769", "https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/commit/a0cfeb13bf1ef5d692d16d4a3b91b34b7456bb11"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32769", "GHSA-cjx7-399x-p2rj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5e5a3fa2-2c30-3780-8b8b-c3cfa5296b1f", "product": {"name": "micronaut-core"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "621ab9c9-0042-3fd0-957a-4a86ecc22b92", "vendor": {"name": "micronaut-projects"}}], "isExploited": false}
