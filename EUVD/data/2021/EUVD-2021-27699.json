During negotiation between a server and a client, the server may fail to give the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO and WILL commands because of improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes sends no response, because a fixed buffer space is available for all responses and that space may have been exhausted.", "datePublished": "2021-09-05T18:26:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:44:10", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/issues/2686"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40523"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4d589f6f-0ba4-3468-b4b1-6c074ebc11e6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bda532ce-857a-3d97-a176-76407f71ab56", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
