The vulnerability is due to an improper check in the code function that manages the verification of the digital signatures of system image files during the initial boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check part of the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have unauthenticated physical access to the device or obtain privileged access to the root shell on the device.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:06:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:34:21", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-xe-cat-verify-BQ5hrXgH"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1453"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42e58999-f929-3390-bfad-74235ea3f5b4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5578b293-038e-37de-af64-c449b0098dca", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
