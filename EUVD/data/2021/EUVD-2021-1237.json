Starting from version 3.1.0 of the service-api XML parsing was introduced. Unfortunately the XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery. This will be resolved in the 5.4.0 release.", "datePublished": "2021-06-23T17:35:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:06", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-24wf-7vf2-pv59", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29620", "https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/pull/1392", "https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/commit/a73e0dfb4eda844c37139df1f9847013d55f084e", "https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.epam.reportportal/service-api"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29620", "GHSA-24wf-7vf2-pv59"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f59671ce-4519-3765-aaf0-6f7783cf0ade", "product": {"name": "reportportal"}, "product_version": "3.1.0, < 5.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4cdf932f-5416-3a8e-9d1c-15b338a340f0", "vendor": {"name": "reportportal"}}], "isExploited": false}
