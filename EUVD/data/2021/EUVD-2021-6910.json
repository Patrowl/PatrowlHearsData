The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly sanitizes values that are parsed from a specific configuration file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tampering with a specific configuration file and then sending an API call. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary code that would be executed on the underlying operating system of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have a privileged set of credentials to the device.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:06:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:35:09", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-xe-os-cmd-inj-Ef6TV5e9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1443"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2675ece8-8c8f-33bb-8c73-5551f0ad5371", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fe61dcbe-bcb0-321c-92fa-10ad58ceb91f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
