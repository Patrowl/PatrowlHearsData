The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-02-17T16:55:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:40:27", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-xss-Lz6HbGCt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1351"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0900af41-310e-3ff3-abf8-6c66cfea381b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5d4af111-b089-30d6-b687-9deb29057b9d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
