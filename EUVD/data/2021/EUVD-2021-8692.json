In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables MITM modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z. As a workaround one can avoid using \"aws-chunked\" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests instead use TLS. MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS.", "datePublished": "2021-03-19T16:00:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:16", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-21390", "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-7gpj-5pgp", "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/11801", "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/e197800f9055489415b53cf137e31e194aaf7ba0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21390"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2a6615c-7bfa-3e76-ae65-3aeafac8b3dd", "product": {"name": "minio"}, "product_version": "< RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71aa2ac3-20e0-3ac1-be01-82e863a2ed81", "vendor": {"name": "minio"}}], "isExploited": false}
