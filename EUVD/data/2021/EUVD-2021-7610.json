If enabled, the bittorrent functionality is vulnerable to a symlink attack that could lead to remote code execution on the device. If an end user inserts a flash drive with a malicious symlink on it that the bittorrent client can write downloads to, then a user is able to download arbitrary files to any desired location on the devices filesystem, which could lead to remote code execution. Example directories vulnerable to this include \"config\", \"downloads\", and \"torrents\", though it should be noted that \"downloads\" is the only vector that allows for arbitrary files to be downloaded to arbitrary locations.", "datePublished": "2021-12-30T21:31:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T17:30:07", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2021-54"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-20153"], "assigner": "tenable", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "328bfcf2-e6a1-36c7-97c1-401f1c195535", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
