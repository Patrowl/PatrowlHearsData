{"id": "EUVD-2021-0202", "enisaUuid": "7edcc496-5330-33d0-b5ec-abe37041f983", "description": "`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, and more, from a well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's `NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the context of the \\\"main\\\" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit to the \\\"main\\\" repository. The rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event, and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which the pull-request is made). Repositories that do not have branch protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or `master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN` would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and affected workflows must be defined on the default branch.", "datePublished": "2021-04-06T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-07-08T03:14:29", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/projen/projen/security/advisories/GHSA-gg2g-m5wc-vccq", "https://github.com/projen/projen/commit/36030c6a4b1acd0054673322612e7c70e9446643", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/projen", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21423", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/projen/PYSEC-2021-111.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21423", "GHSA-gg2g-m5wc-vccq", "PYSEC-2021-111"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "be70be57-4a33-38eb-84c2-8f38f2e613c4", "product": {"name": "projen"}, "product_version": "0.6.0, < 0.16.41"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b9b1e45-8e78-316b-a735-6a52990e1103", "vendor": {"name": "projen"}}], "isExploited": false}
