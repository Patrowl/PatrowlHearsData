All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.", "datePublished": "2021-06-22T19:20:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-jj6m-r8jc-2gp7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32699", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/e0078eee0a71d61573a94c75e6efcad069d78de3", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32699", "GHSA-jj6m-r8jc-2gp7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e92bcefe-eb97-3f28-afd1-8cae82e81c45", "product": {"name": "wings"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e539ce1-ce51-33d6-ab73-dde49e39e1d8", "vendor": {"name": "pterodactyl"}}], "isExploited": false}
