This vulnerability exists because a password policy check is incomplete at the time a password is changed at server side using the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted API request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change their own password to a value that does not comply with the configured strong authentication requirements.", "datePublished": "2021-08-04T17:20:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:04:53", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cmx-GkCvfd4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1522"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cdf12d2e-7345-3542-88c4-85ed02dc67e5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e3333ec9-1507-344c-8cd5-d125af1c6d3a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
