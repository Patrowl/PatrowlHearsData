It was possible to bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a \"blocked\" extension within another \"blocked\" extension in the \"wcuf_file_name\" parameter. It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the \"wcuf_current_upload_session_id\" parameter.", "datePublished": "2021-04-05T18:27:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T19:21:18", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ed4288a1-f7e4-455f-b765-5ac343f87194", "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/03/critical-vulnerability-patched-in-woocommerce-upload-files/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-24171"], "assigner": "WPScan", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "26cec384-f186-3f30-b244-60d38b46119a", "product": {"name": "WooCommerce Upload Files"}, "product_version": "59.4 <59.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "966cfc91-cd1f-3744-b209-a30c2d1558d6", "vendor": {"name": "Unknown"}}], "isExploited": false}
