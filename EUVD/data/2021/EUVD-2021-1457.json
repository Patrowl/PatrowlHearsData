A bug was found in containerd versions prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host\u2019s filesystem. Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with specific files.", "datePublished": "2021-07-19T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T14:27:20", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-c72p-9xmj-rx3w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32760", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/22e9a70c71eff6507be71955947a611f2ed91e6c", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/7ad08c69e09ee4930a48dbf2aab3cd612458617f", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.4.8", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.4", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDMNDPJJTP3J5GOEDB66F6MGXUTRG3Y3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDMNDPJJTP3J5GOEDB66F6MGXUTRG3Y3", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-31", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32760.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-32760", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-32760.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32760", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2021-32760.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-32760.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2183", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDMNDPJJTP3J5GOEDB66F6MGXUTRG3Y3/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32760", "GHSA-c72p-9xmj-rx3w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "15e39b0e-fa87-3d6b-b0b8-c19f8453d873", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.4.7"}, {"id": "22c70866-654c-3c45-aadc-468141aca7fa", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "1.5.0, \u2264 1.5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "95b4ace7-ea50-36ec-839e-e2fd013d5854", "vendor": {"name": "containerd"}}], "isExploited": false}
