The server part of pupnp (libupnp) appears to be vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks because it does not check the value of the `Host` header. This can be mitigated by using DNS revolvers which block DNS-rebinding attacks. The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.14.6 and later.", "datePublished": "2021-04-20T21:10:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:02:51", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29462.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-29462.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29462", "https://github.com/pupnp/pupnp/security/advisories/GHSA-6hqq-w3jq-9fhg", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/20/4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29462"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5c1a6384-3345-33cb-a81d-cea8a9ca852b", "product": {"name": "pupnp"}, "product_version": "< 1.14.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c8d99a22-8a4a-38ff-a6f3-c5c3ab540178", "vendor": {"name": "pupnp"}}], "isExploited": false}
