A successful exploit could cause system instability if important system files are overwritten. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input for the file path in a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to a targeted device and issuing a specific CLI command with crafted user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the file system of the affected device. The attacker would need valid user credentials on the device.", "datePublished": "2021-04-29T17:30:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:25:06", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-file-overwrite-XknRjGdB", "https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10382"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1256"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3f2beaad-fb92-378d-a074-ec502d4f9804", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e05c307e-7a18-3b80-9ddd-40c8148f0d20", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
