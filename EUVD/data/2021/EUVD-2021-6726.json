The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T19:57:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:22:26", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vman-pathtrav-Z5mCVsjf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1259"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ee491bb-e4e3-3220-948f-9eb0ea6ce20e", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "49b3350d-e9a2-30e1-a076-8f8a9b223efd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
