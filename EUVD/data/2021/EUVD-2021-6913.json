The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an affected device inspects certain DNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through an affected device that is performing NAT for DNS packets. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability can be exploited only by traffic that is sent through an affected device via IPv4 packets. The vulnerability cannot be exploited via IPv6 traffic.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:06:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:34:59", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-alg-dos-hbBS7SZE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1446"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "39bc49c0-da5c-317a-b94d-4b8a0e4388e9", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4273ed95-6f46-350d-a740-57c02aee6df7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
