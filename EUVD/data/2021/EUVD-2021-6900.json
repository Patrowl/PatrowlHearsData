This vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when the device processes traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to the device. The attacker must have a man-in-the-middle position between Cisco vManage and an associated device that is running an affected version of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software. An exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a controllable buffer overflow attack (and possibly execute arbitrary commands as the root user) or cause a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:05:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:36:17", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-buffover-CqdRWLc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1433"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10e28bf1-cf53-396f-a5f4-c7d77149de49", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ef77eccb-d0cf-3cac-9186-1145d8f9d5f4", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
