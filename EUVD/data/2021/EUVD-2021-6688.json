The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a URL into a field in the user interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a Webex Meetings invitation email that contains a link to a destination of their choosing. Because this email is sent from a trusted source, the recipient may be more likely to click the link.", "datePublished": "2021-02-04T16:35:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:53:20", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wbx-linkinj-WWZpVqu9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1221"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a894fb08-5425-3a41-b76c-ee69c6a62496", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d465965-2166-3521-ae21-c002de1906bc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
