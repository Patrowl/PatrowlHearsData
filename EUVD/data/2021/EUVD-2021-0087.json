It is an is a independently maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before version 3.4.5, the /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As a workaround, if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to \\\"0\\\" (seconds) which should make the token unusable.", "datePublished": "2021-01-11T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-06-09T05:01:03", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/releases/tag/3.4.5", "https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Security-Too", "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/61d313150b5f620d0b800896c4f2199005e84b1f", "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-hh7m-rx4f-4vpv", "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/pull/422", "https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/6d50ee9169acf813257c37b75babe9c28e83542a", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21241", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/flask-security-too/PYSEC-2021-91.yaml", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118165844/https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/releases/tag/3.4.5", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118165958/https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/6d50ee9169acf813257c37b75babe9c28e83542a", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118170445/https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/commit/61d313150b5f620d0b800896c4f2199005e84b1f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210118170502/https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/security/advisories/GHSA-hh7m-rx4f-4vpv", "https://web.archive.org/web/20211207005640/https://github.com/Flask-Middleware/flask-security/pull/422", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-21241.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-21241"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21241", "GHSA-hh7m-rx4f-4vpv", "PYSEC-2021-91"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ccdcd155-d953-3bb0-9db9-dca11c3c5d5e", "product": {"name": "flask-security-too"}, "product_version": "3.3.0, < 3.4.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4dd764a5-bd95-39b7-9442-992562ed68d0", "vendor": {"name": "Flask-Middleware"}}], "isExploited": false}
