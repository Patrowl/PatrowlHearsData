The attacker would require valid device credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTPS request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the device.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:55:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:44:23", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-dir-traversal-95UyW5tk"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34762"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "498c37e2-826f-3a25-a9b0-baccf19297a1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "904be86a-3385-3df3-bc7c-d18b54217431", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
