This vulnerability is due to improper control of a resource. An attacker with the ability to spoof a trusted IKEv2 site-to-site VPN peer and in possession of valid IKEv2 credentials for that peer could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed, authenticated IKEv2 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the device.", "datePublished": "2021-10-27T18:50:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:46:26", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ikev2-dos-g4cmrr7C"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-40125"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ddd47ce7-a5ba-3978-a2b2-a298be4a1476", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0076107d-898a-3365-8a15-b2ff2d6154b2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
