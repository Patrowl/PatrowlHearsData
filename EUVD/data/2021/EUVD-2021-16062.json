Any ScratchOAuth2-related data normally accessible and modifiable by a user can be read and modified by a third party. 1.

User posts code on their profile, not knowing it is a ScratchOAuth2 login code. 6. 3rd party site completes login with ScratchOAuth2. 7. 3rd party site has full access to anything the user could do if they directly logged in.
