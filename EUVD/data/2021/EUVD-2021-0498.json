In HtmlSanitizer before version 5.0.372, there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag. The problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372.", "datePublished": "2021-01-04T18:20:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:03", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-8j9v-h2vp-2hhv", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26293", "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/commit/a3a7602a44d4155d51ec0fbbedc2a49e9c7e2eb8", "https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer/releases/tag/v5.0.372", "https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlSanitizer", "https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlSanitizer/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26293", "GHSA-8j9v-h2vp-2hhv"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c38d7b70-db2f-3987-bcf9-ad695de2b39b", "product": {"name": "HtmlSanitizer"}, "product_version": "< 5.0.372"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e6b061c7-c5e7-3f48-b465-2c89cad02c45", "vendor": {"name": "mganss"}}], "isExploited": false}
