The header value X-Scope-OrgID is used to construct file paths for rules files, and if crafted to conduct directory traversal such as ae ../../sensitive/path/in/deployment pathname, then Cortex will attempt to parse a rules file at that location and include some of the contents in the error message. (Other Cortex API requests can also be sent a malicious OrgID header, e.g., tricking the ingester into writing metrics to a different location, but the effect is nuisance rather than information disclosure.)", "datePublished": "2021-08-03T14:03:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T00:47:43", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36157", "https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/pull/4375", "https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/commit/d9e1f81f40c607b9e97c2fc6db70ae54679917c4", "https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex", "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-36157.html", "https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-36157", "GHSA-jphm-g89m-v42p"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07658a17-02da-3d61-9ee6-faeaf8b1f8a4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53206fec-7f56-35fb-8e24-4d0496b2e5e7", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
