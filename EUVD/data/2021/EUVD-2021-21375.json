This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and submitting crafted input to the CLI. The attacker must be authenticated as an administrative user to execute the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root-level privileges.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:26:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:58:45", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-maapi-privesc-KSUg7QSS"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34725"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2724208c-3101-3fd6-a481-9a5835c4370b", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2ec8af1-5c6a-3718-8f8a-d14d3e93b66c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
