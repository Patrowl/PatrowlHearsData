MITRE classifies this weakness as an Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427) in which a private package dependency may be replaced by an unauthorized package of the same name published to a well-known public repository such as PyPi. The configuration has been updated to only install components built by Antilles, removing all other public package indexes. Additionally, the antilles-tools dependency has been published to PyPi.", "datePublished": "2021-11-12T22:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-12-13T06:35:07", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/security/advisories/GHSA-hgc3-hp6x-wpgx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3840", "https://github.com/lenovo/Antilles/commit/c7b9c5740908b343aceefe69733d9972e64df0b9", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/antilles-tools/PYSEC-2021-840.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3840", "GHSA-hgc3-hp6x-wpgx", "PYSEC-2021-840"], "assigner": "lenovo", "epss": 1.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "33da7152-024e-38b9-a5eb-4448858daee3", "product": {"name": "Antilles"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cf3a5743-49ff-3d57-b5c3-dad2f0f5ffa8", "vendor": {"name": "Antilles"}}], "isExploited": false}
