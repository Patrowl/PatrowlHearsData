It is possible to bypass/evade any HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet with random TCP options of the md5header from the client side. After the three-way handshake, it's possible to inject an RST ACK with a random TCP md5header option. Then, the client can send an HTTP GET request with a forbidden URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and send the response HTTP packet for the client's request. These packets will not trigger a Suricata reject action.", "datePublished": "2021-12-16T04:07:57", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T19:26:34", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/releases", "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/4710", "https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-6-0-4-and-5-0-8-released/1942", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/50e2b973eeec7172991bf8f544ab06fb782b97df", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45098", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00029.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-45098"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.65, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d6c97a09-ae15-389a-92c7-86efd04cf9a2", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2cabc2f7-fefb-3485-b6a2-c4faff84205f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
