The Nextcloud OfficeOnline application prior to version 1.1.1 returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`). It is recommended that the OfficeOnline application is upgraded to 1.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the OfficeOnline application in the app settings.", "datePublished": "2021-10-25T21:40:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:58:18", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-56wm-r6jm-3v9h", "https://github.com/nextcloud/officeonline/pull/204"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39224"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8801c38b-4983-38e7-8da2-3a0a0b438479", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dcd6300e-83f1-3e5b-bddc-1738ad769bf6", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
