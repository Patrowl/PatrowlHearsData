{"id": "EUVD-2021-19544", "enisaUuid": "55484db1-6cb2-312d-ba87-8ab60ae9ddfa", "description": "Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions Envoy transitions a H/2 connection to the CLOSED state when it receives a GOAWAY frame without any streams outstanding. The connection state is transitioned to DRAINING when it receives a SETTING frame with the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter set to 0. Receiving these two frames in the same I/O event results in abnormal termination of the Envoy process due to invalid state transition from CLOSED to DRAINING. A sequence of H/2 frames delivered by an untrusted upstream server will result in Denial of Service in the presence of untrusted **upstream** servers. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4 contain fixes to stop processing of pending H/2 frames after connection transition to the CLOSED state.", "datePublished": "2021-08-24T20:55:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:56", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32780.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32780", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-32780.html", "https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.0/version_history/version_history", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-j374-mjrw-vvp8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32780"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ef14106-ceac-323a-b4f6-2df2c833039d", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.19.0, < 1.19.1"}, {"id": "bce9b175-6157-3ea6-98e7-f90e3fdbb9f1", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.18.0, < 1.18.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "701b395a-1005-3c31-92eb-7647b1c53767", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
