In affected versions a vulnerability exists in sdp_cstate_alloc_buf which allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed. This will cause a memory leak over time. The data can be a very large object, which can be caused by an attacker continuously sending sdp packets and this may cause the service of the target device to crash.", "datePublished": "2021-11-12T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:18", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41229.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-41229", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-41229.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-41229", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-41229.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2081", "https://github.com/bluez/bluez/security/advisories/GHSA-3fqg-r8j5-f5xq", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00022.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211203-0004/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/10/msg00026.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41229"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "68e4a0b5-2383-3a45-bd7b-023a1c40156c", "product": {"name": "BlueZ"}, "product_version": "= 5.58"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6dc5fd00-9bfa-3ffa-a278-1e2813564d4e", "vendor": {"name": "BlueZ"}}], "isExploited": false}
