The attacker must be authenticated on the affected device as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a file as a lower-privileged user. The commands are then executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:05:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:36:27", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-sdwarbcmdexec-sspOMUr3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1432"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e2e99db8-5fde-3637-92ef-838044efdc49", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b925cb0-9e81-3257-b55c-6ccc1a82e2f4", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
