This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-10-21T02:50:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:47:00", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sec-work-xss-t6SYtu8Q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34789"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "864e529b-2f24-3612-914a-e1f8960d5abd", "product": {"name": "Cisco Secure Workload"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "396fb302-93b3-3953-a56c-e4fe98ca5611", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
