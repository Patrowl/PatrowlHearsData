In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to place a valid Gift Card product into the shopping cart. An uploaded file is placed at a predetermined path on the web server with a user-specified filename and extension. This occurs because the ywgc-upload-picture parameter can have a .php value even though the intention was to only allow uploads of Gift Card images.", "datePublished": "2021-02-22T14:24:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T16:45:51", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:U/UI:N", "references": ["https://yithemes.com/themes/plugins/yith-woocommerce-gift-cards/", "https://github.com/guy-liu/yith-giftdrop"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-3120"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 12.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f96a336d-675e-3462-a9b2-a639d680cbf2", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fc730d28-338b-3739-a7a9-4ec5c1b6f4fe", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
