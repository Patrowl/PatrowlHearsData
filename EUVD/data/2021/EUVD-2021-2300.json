All versions of graphql-playground-react older than graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.", "datePublished": "2021-11-04T20:05:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:08:31", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8", "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41249", "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/commit/b8a956006835992f12c46b90384a79ab82bcadad", "https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/blob/main/docs/security/2021-introspection-schema-xss.md#2-more-details-on-the-vulnerability", "https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41249", "GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5843b271-2e66-340a-ab5e-91e0fd904519", "product": {"name": "graphql-playground"}, "product_version": "< 1.7.28"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d54c2400-7403-3b3b-9790-75b0bcc6ae28", "vendor": {"name": "graphql"}}], "isExploited": false}
