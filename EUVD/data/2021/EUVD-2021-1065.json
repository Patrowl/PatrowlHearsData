The reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol headers.", "datePublished": "2021-03-08T04:45:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:31:07", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23351", "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/issues/69", "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/71", "https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/commit/7f48261db810703d173f27f3309a808cc2b49b8b", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4BNVGJMVI3ZTZ675EFPUHPGXCKCGSX46", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C36IBVOZXRTWM7MGTRUTOM56P5RR74VU", "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMPIRESGOPROXYPROTO-1081577", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4BNVGJMVI3ZTZ675EFPUHPGXCKCGSX46/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C36IBVOZXRTWM7MGTRUTOM56P5RR74VU/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4BNVGJMVI3ZTZ675EFPUHPGXCKCGSX46/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C36IBVOZXRTWM7MGTRUTOM56P5RR74VU/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-23351", "GHSA-fqh4-rh59-xhvf"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 1.34, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70dc7084-f5c5-3866-b97a-d4dbd8d1f275", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
