These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.", "datePublished": "2021-05-22T06:40:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T21:20:18", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-wap-inject-Mp9FSdG"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1555"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fe0267dd-7cac-3b4b-bc44-264e3ada048f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Business Wireless Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f230e858-3d2d-32cc-958b-3bcff3db3e99", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
