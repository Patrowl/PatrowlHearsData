This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to retrieve a crafted file that contains malicious payload and upload it to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2021-05-06T12:41:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:20:31", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wsa-xss-mVjOWchB"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1490"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5fa8331-48fe-3003-859c-f5cb303b5124", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17df5167-93b9-3ded-afc7-2d15d352a2fb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
