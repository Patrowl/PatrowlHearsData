The vulnerability is due to missing checks when Cisco Discovery Protocol messages are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected IP camera to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:20:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:47:21", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcameras-dos-9zdZcUfq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1131"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "432a38fd-f09c-32de-9cc1-8f31b9f43695", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dc0454f7-bd12-3988-ad86-77444280d6d0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
