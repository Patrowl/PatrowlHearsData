{"id": "EUVD-2021-6625", "enisaUuid": "c51f2cb2-b3aa-35f3-afa0-7d7dafd223de", "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the interface. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-01-13T21:37:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T20:42:22", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-LPTQ3EQC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1158"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3a10e7e-6a74-30dc-8319-d2de0e9973af", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "410197e3-b63b-3f77-aae3-60e88e48d88c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
