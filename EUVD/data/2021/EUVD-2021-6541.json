This attack requires a user with system administration rights to execute the installer and requires the attacker to replace the files in a very short time window between file integrity validation and execution. Such an attack may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure.", "datePublished": "2021-04-21T22:30:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T15:55:18", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5172"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1074"], "assigner": "nvidia", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c58a50b1-7cdd-32d3-963a-8d02f4758694", "product": {"name": "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver"}, "product_version": "R390 driver branch"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bfeb1fd8-a671-3b09-a897-fa57dc5dd0f4", "vendor": {"name": "NVIDIA"}}], "isExploited": false}
