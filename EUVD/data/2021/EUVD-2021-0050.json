Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.", "datePublished": "2021-10-26T11:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-05-25T05:07:00", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/changelog.html", "https://github.com/dask/dask/tags", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j8fq-86c5-5v2r", "https://github.com/dask/distributed/security/advisories/GHSA-hwqr-f3v9-hwxr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42343", "https://github.com/dask/distributed/pull/5427", "https://github.com/dask/distributed/commit/afce4be8e05fb180e50a9d9e38465f1a82295e1b", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/dask/PYSEC-2021-387.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/distributed/PYSEC-2021-871.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/distributed/PYSEC-2021-872.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-42343.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-42343"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-42343", "GHSA-j8fq-86c5-5v2r", "PYSEC-2021-387", "GHSA-hwqr-f3v9-hwxr"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aefbcdd6-7467-32c7-88ac-ebe2d812c653", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "47c1516b-5135-39fb-b8c4-63d3fdf09876", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
