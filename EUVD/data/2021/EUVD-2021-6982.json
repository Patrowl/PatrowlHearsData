This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on API endpoints when Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software is running in multi-tenant mode. An attacker with access to a device that is managed in the multi-tenant environment could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to an affected API endpoint on the vManage system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that may include hashed credentials that could be used in future attacks.", "datePublished": "2021-05-06T12:51:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:16:48", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sd-wan-vmanage-9VZO4gfU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1515"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7fbc548e-4ef0-38c1-ad2f-ea4bee364d50", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b3e2ff7-b4e5-3a67-8549-ea082dda78c2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
