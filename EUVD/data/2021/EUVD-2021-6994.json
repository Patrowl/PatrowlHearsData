The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of values in Webex recording files that are stored in Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious WRF file to a user as a link or email attachment and then persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the affected software and view memory state information.", "datePublished": "2021-06-04T16:45:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:09:59", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-player-kxtkFbnR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1527"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a73eead-d190-30bd-88c8-a6dc746d786d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ddf97c36-009a-3e46-8e9d-0f54e0e43b3f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
