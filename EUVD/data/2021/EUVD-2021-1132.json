As a result, a malicious plugin author could use characters in a plugin name that would result in unexpected behavior, such as duplicating the name of another plugin or spoofing the output to `helm --help`. This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2. A possible workaround is to not install untrusted Helm plugins. Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T21:40:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 3.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-m54r-vrmv-hw33", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15186", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/809e2d999e2c33e20e77f6bff30652d79c287542", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/c8d6b01d72c9604e43ee70d0d78fadd54c2d8499", "https://github.com/helm/helm", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15186.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2021:0729"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15186", "GHSA-m54r-vrmv-hw33"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0599455d-e0b8-3cf7-8d02-df2f75102877", "product": {"name": "helm"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.3.2"}, {"id": "85988e6f-e88d-3380-9244-ca6b4ae0caea", "product": {"name": "helm"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.16.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7c90c034-8da7-36fe-bc63-e04c3027896f", "vendor": {"name": "helm"}}], "isExploited": false}
