In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later in order to receive the patch. One workaround is available. Administrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the endpoints: `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter, and `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter.", "datePublished": "2021-08-31T17:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-11-16T03:58:44", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-3x4c-pq33-4w3q", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.41.1", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/cb35df940a", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXT7ID7DNBRN2TVTETU3SYQHJKEG6PXN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VHDEPCZ22GJFMZCWA2XZAGPOEV72POF/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-39164", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/matrix-synapse/PYSEC-2021-425.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-39164.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-39164", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PXT7ID7DNBRN2TVTETU3SYQHJKEG6PXN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2VHDEPCZ22GJFMZCWA2XZAGPOEV72POF/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-39164", "GHSA-3x4c-pq33-4w3q", "PYSEC-2021-425"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "53385e85-573a-370a-b11e-e119c13f025e", "product": {"name": "synapse"}, "product_version": "< 1.41.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e0c85716-283d-3d50-b766-53fd23eabfb8", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
