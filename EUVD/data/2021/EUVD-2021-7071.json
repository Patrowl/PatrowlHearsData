These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:36:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:06:31", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-stored-xss-TWwjVPdL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1604"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "99bd4fa9-1f5d-3008-9f06-1dd2ca1b16d6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4fbf464a-baaa-3571-9178-46338e47d70b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
