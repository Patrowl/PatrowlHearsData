In affected versions the code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still missing validation. As a result, attackers can trigger denial of service (via dereferencing `nullptr`s or via `CHECK`-failures) as well as abuse undefined behavior (binding references to `nullptr`s). An attacker can also read and write from heap buffers, depending on the API that gets used and the arguments that are passed to the call. Given that the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is unmaintained, it is recommend to no longer use these APIs. We will deprecate TensorFlow's boosted trees APIs in subsequent releases. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "datePublished": "2021-11-05T22:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-11-13T06:52:43", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5c8c9a8bfe750f9743d0c859bae112060b216f5c", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-57wx-m983-2f88", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41208", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2021-617.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2021-815.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2021-400.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41208.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-41208"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41208", "GHSA-57wx-m983-2f88", "PYSEC-2021-617"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "38f10090-134e-3677-851e-e1e26fa50cbf", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.4.4"}, {"id": "792564d8-7d13-3b41-95de-d42a23f9cd7f", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.5.0, < 2.5.2"}, {"id": "7da9d664-4972-3866-b4d8-ec9fa5c46380", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.6.0, < 2.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b33a017-b145-38a5-83f6-8fcd178a0c9e", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
