A cross-site scripting vulnerability is present in versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. The Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud server used a `text/html` Content-Type when serving files to users. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy.", "datePublished": "2021-07-12T21:05:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-32733", "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-x4w3-jhcr-57pq", "https://github.com/nextcloud/text/pull/1689", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1241460"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32733"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b15269d-d066-32be-8eee-2257f77ad386", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "21.0.0, < 21.0.3"}, {"id": "9f7ecabd-61f8-37c5-9e8b-6030c2fed713", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "20.0.0, < 20.0.11"}, {"id": "ca453902-cd2b-309e-8888-88b658615055", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 19.0.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c03f651-cc4e-3caf-baa3-30490be85bf7", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
