In affected versions the strided slice implementation in TFLite has a logic bug which can allow an attacker to trigger an infinite loop. This arises from newly introduced support for [ellipsis in axis definition](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/strided_slice.cc#L103-L122). An attacker can craft a model such that `ellipsis_end_idx` is smaller than `i` (e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop does not increase `i` and the `continue` statement causes execution to skip over the preincrement at the end of the outer loop. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695. TensorFlow 2.6.0 is the only affected version.", "datePublished": "2021-08-12T22:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:47", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-mhhc-q96p-mfm9", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37686", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2021-599.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2021-797.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2021-308.yaml", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.4", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.4.3", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.5.1", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.6.0", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-37686.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-37686"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37686", "GHSA-mhhc-q96p-mfm9", "PYSEC-2021-599"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb55c06c-9f76-316e-b055-12bf13eba909", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.6.0rc0, < 2.6.0rc2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e57f0b8d-cefb-3558-92ad-a2a187e01262", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
