The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.", "datePublished": "2021-09-08T13:02:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:47:33", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-28701.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4977", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-28701.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-384.txt", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-384.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/08/2", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L4MI3MQAPGILCLXBGQWPZHGE3ALSO4ZU/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CEHZLIR5DFYYQBH55AERWHLO54OFU42C/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3HEHUIUWSSMCQGQY3GWX4J2SZGYP5W2Z/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28701"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ad3d541-499a-3ac6-965f-0f5fda2417a9", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.12.x <unspecified"}, {"id": "62838784-7040-3e16-8708-97b699c0f98f", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.15.x <unspecified"}, {"id": "a0d1fdac-402f-34d6-a3e6-429515dc5d07", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": "4.11.x"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "49e03c12-e698-37fe-b2ff-74738e2f3ba9", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
