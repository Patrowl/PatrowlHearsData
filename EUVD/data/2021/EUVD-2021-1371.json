In `@backstage/techdocs-common` versions prior to 0.6.3, a malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.", "datePublished": "2021-06-03T22:00:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:31", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-pgf8-28gg-vpr6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32662", "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/8cefadca04cbf01d0394b0cb1983247e5f1d6208", "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/release-2021-05-27"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32662", "GHSA-pgf8-28gg-vpr6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f65e0b40-f080-3ea8-9fad-0390fd124602", "product": {"name": "backstage"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9a87c9c-2181-37bf-9aae-4a0e8df969d2", "vendor": {"name": "backstage"}}], "isExploited": false}
