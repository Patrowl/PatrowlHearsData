In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak apps that act as clients for AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus), system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is due to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses. Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, and as of time of publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.", "datePublished": "2021-10-08T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T02:59:31", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-41133.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4984", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4107", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4106", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4044", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4042", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-41133", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2021-41133.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-41133", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2021-41133.html", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-67h7-w3jq-vh4q", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/1330662f33a55e88bfe18e76de28b7922d91a999", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/26b12484eb8a6219b9e7aa287b298a894b2f34ca", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/462fca2c666e0cd2b60d6d2593a7216a83047aaf", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/4c34815784e9ffda5733225c7d95824f96375e36", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/89ae9fe74c6d445bb1b3a40e568d77cf5de47e48", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/9766ee05b1425db397d2cf23afd24c7f6146a69f", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/a10f52a7565c549612c92b8e736a6698a53db330", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/e26ac7586c392b5eb35ff4609fe232c52523b2cf", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R5656ONDP2MGKIJMKEC7N2NXCV27WGTC/", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/26/9", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T5DKCYRC6MFSTFCUP4DELCOUUP3SFEFX/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-12"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-41133"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02c3a658-48cc-39fe-b2f6-51b38b03a7a1", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.11.0, < 1.12.0"}, {"id": "5c41e444-c391-3adb-932f-4c13238557da", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.10.0, < 1.10.4"}, {"id": "68940c53-53e7-3ceb-8b24-25ebe78a38b0", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.8.0, \u2264 1.8.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cd55dae0-966c-37f7-a0c6-d45d23663143", "vendor": {"name": "flatpak"}}], "isExploited": false}
