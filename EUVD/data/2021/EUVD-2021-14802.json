A local privilege escalation vulnerability is present in the logging function. SecureConnector runs with administrative privileges and writes logs entries to a file in %PROGRAMDATA%\\ForeScout SecureConnector\\ that has full permissions for the Everyone group. Using a symbolic link allows an attacker to point the log file to a privileged location such as %WINDIR%\\System32. The resulting log file adopts the file permissions of the source of the symbolic link (in this case, the Everyone group). The log file in System32 can be replaced and renamed with a malicious DLL for DLL hijacking.", "datePublished": "2021-04-14T14:56:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T21:33:17", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://docs.forescout.com", "https://www.adversis.io/research/2021/3/30/forescout-secure-connector-local-privilege-escalation", "https://jordanpotti.com/2021/03/30/forescout-priv-esc-folder-permissions/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-28098"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "daf15c3a-8728-379e-bb91-5af74ab3d852", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01ca08af-86b4-3fb9-83e7-cdab6499fd8a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
