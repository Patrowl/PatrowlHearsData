This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of the source of a received LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an SFP interface to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable switching on the SFP interface, which could disrupt network traffic.", "datePublished": "2021-02-24T19:30:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:38:56", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-lldap-dos-WerV9CFj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1231"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "14c0ccb4-96b0-3c01-832c-c62af58ee89a", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d3873dba-8f42-3561-9144-f09bde9ceb7f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
