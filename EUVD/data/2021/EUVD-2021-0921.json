These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\". Hydra does not check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. Exploiting this vulnerability is somewhat difficult because: - TLS protects against MITM which makes it difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks - The expiry time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it could be replayed This has been patched in version v1.4.0+oryOS.17", "datePublished": "2020-04-06T16:30:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:22:09", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ory/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5300", "https://github.com/ory/hydra/commit/700d17d3b7d507de1b1d459a7261d6fb2571ebe3", "https://github.com/ory/hydra", "https://github.com/ory/hydra/releases/tag/v1.4.0", "https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5300", "GHSA-3p3g-vpw6-4w66"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "878f3bba-5050-3336-9b31-02659117ce0b", "product": {"name": "hydra"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.0+oryOS.17"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26e2abf4-a768-3643-af40-f67169a47638", "vendor": {"name": "ory"}}], "isExploited": false}
