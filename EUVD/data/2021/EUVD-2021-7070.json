These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2021-07-08T18:35:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T22:06:37", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-stored-xss-TWwjVPdL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1603"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d3330197-d911-3206-9557-e0ceb2d90c68", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "54deacd9-45b7-3ae2-bbcd-3992b73aafdd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
