When creating a new user, it generates a Unique ID for their profile. This UID is their private email address with symbols removed and periods replaced with hyphens. For example. JohnDoe@example.com would become /members/johndoeexample-com and Jo.test@example.com would become /members/jo-testexample-com. The members list is available to everyone and (in a default configuration) often without authentication. It is therefore trivial to collect a list of email addresses.", "datePublished": "2022-01-26T15:35:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:25:16", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.buddyboss.com/resources/buddyboss-platform-releases/", "https://www.cygenta.co.uk/post/buddyboss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-44692"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "44932b8a-de4f-37b6-a834-ad134a77ce6e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "09742fe3-8dfc-38f9-9697-4871b7cdaa09", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
