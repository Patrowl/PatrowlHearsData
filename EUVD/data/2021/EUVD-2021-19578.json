In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in `virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from. Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and, under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.", "datePublished": "2023-02-17T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:56", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-054_057-moby-hyperkit/", "https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/pull/313", "https://github.com/moby/hyperkit/commit/af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32846"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cd1d6605-bc32-373c-8065-7b96055de0f1", "product": {"name": "hyperkit"}, "product_version": "0.20210107 \u22640.20210107"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87014cf8-19cf-33ad-ae12-93c9a0f17801", "vendor": {"name": "moby"}}], "isExploited": false}
