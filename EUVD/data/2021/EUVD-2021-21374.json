An attacker must be authenticated on an affected device as a PRIV15 user. This vulnerability is due to insufficient file system protection and the presence of a sensitive file in the bootflash directory on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by overwriting an installer file stored in the bootflash directory with arbitrary commands that can be executed with root-level privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write changes to the configuration database on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2021-09-23T02:26:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T21:58:53", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxesdwan-privesc-VP4FG3jD"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-34724"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c591f35c-c135-3f68-a41b-de8c9812a296", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "57929fa5-ff8a-35eb-a6b6-03922e55ec4b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
