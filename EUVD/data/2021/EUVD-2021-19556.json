Prior to Pi-hole Web interface version 5.5.1, the function to add domains to blocklists or allowlists is vulnerable to a stored cross-site-scripting vulnerability. User input added as a wildcard domain to a blocklist or allowlist is unfiltered in the web interface. Since the payload is stored permanently as a wildcard domain, this is a persistent XSS vulnerability. A remote attacker can therefore attack administrative user accounts through client-side attacks. Pi-hole Web Interface version 5.5.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2021-08-04T17:55:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/releases/tag/v5.5.1", "https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE/security/advisories/GHSA-g3w6-q4fg-p8x8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32793"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "376777f2-832a-3b9b-aed5-2482d9ec684a", "product": {"name": "AdminLTE"}, "product_version": "< 5.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2bd2f024-83ac-3c93-ba44-faf3775ae541", "vendor": {"name": "pi-hole"}}], "isExploited": false}
