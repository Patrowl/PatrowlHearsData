In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z it is possible to bypass a readOnly policy by creating a temporary 'mc share upload' URL. Everyone is impacted who uses MinIO multi-users. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z. As a workaround, one can disable uploads with `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` as mentioned in the S3 API RESTObjectPOST docs by using a proxy in front of MinIO.", "datePublished": "2021-03-08T18:40:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-21362", "https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-hq5j-6r98-9m8v", "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/11682", "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/039f59b552319fcc2f83631bb421a7d4b82bc482", "https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21362"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ea8e231-1fc8-348c-8b0a-5d309e0a6070", "product": {"name": "minio"}, "product_version": "< RELEASE.2021-03-04T00-53-13Z"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7bc6c2c-05ce-3e8a-a77c-d63d7a592659", "vendor": {"name": "minio"}}], "isExploited": false}
