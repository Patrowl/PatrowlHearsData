This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the IOx web server on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IOx web server to stop processing requests, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2021-03-24T20:06:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T23:34:03", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-dos-4Fgcjh6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-1460"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03592612-5bdb-3d91-a6fe-fa083d5b2b95", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "85743da6-7c7c-3742-bc50-923839527ea3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
