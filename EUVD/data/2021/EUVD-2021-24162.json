With this vulnerability in place, an attacker may increment the incoming frame counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame counter value and invalid payload. This results in denial of service/valid packets in the network. There is also a possibility of a replay attack in the stack.", "datePublished": "2021-08-05T15:43:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T01:23:01", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.microchip.com/product-change-notifications/#/", "https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/wireless-connectivity/sub-ghz/miwi-protocol", "https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/asf-release-notes-3.50.0.100-readme.pdf", "https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/libraries-code-examples-and-more/advanced-software-framework-for-sam-devices#Downloads", "https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/wireless-connectivity/software-vulnerability-response/miwi-software-vulnerability"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-37604"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "409a9b08-ad1d-39f1-89c8-7e4b78dd680e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "04ab5e09-f9f1-327e-833d-a640a8474a79", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
