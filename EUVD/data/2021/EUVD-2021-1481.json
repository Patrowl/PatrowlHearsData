A vulnerability exists in versions prior to 12.6.88, 12.10.4, and 13.0. The script service method used to reset the authentication failures record can be executed by any user with Script rights and does not require Programming rights. An attacher with script rights who is able to reset the authentication failure record might perform a brute force attack, since they would be able to virtually deactivate the mechanism introduced to mitigate those attacks. The problem has been patched in version 12.6.8, 12.10.4 and 13.0. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "datePublished": "2021-07-01T16:45:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 2.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-m738-3rc4-5xv3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32729", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18276"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32729", "GHSA-m738-3rc4-5xv3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "50303e7a-b7f1-3dc1-bc9f-52d1c92f74aa", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "> 11.6RC1, < 12.6.8"}, {"id": "e9ae62b1-d59e-3b7c-9d8c-6bc2be65bb6c", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "12.10.0, < 12.10.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "631444aa-488e-3d41-a5fa-03119361ce07", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
