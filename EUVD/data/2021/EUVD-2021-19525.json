FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition file.", "datePublished": "2021-07-12T23:00:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:33:55", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid/security/advisories/GHSA-39r7-275f-rvgw"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32754"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c7abc0d-fa09-3b73-9060-445e469a41fa", "product": {"name": "FlowDroid"}, "product_version": "< 2.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0bd36367-3cbd-3581-9875-b4304e8f7a16", "vendor": {"name": "secure-software-engineering"}}], "isExploited": false}
