The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured user authorization level. This could allow the attacker to modify the configuration of an affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:17:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:42:08", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanuafw-ZHkdGGEy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3592"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b6a7befc-7717-3775-96c0-5197acb8a1eb", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c8c3a9f-6bf1-3cdf-bf43-b7c1c5d9c186", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
