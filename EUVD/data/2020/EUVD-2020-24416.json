The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:20:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:56:33", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-m4FEEGWX"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3145"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "400b84a2-5a4f-3fd1-9f53-e4e1556af3ab", "product": {"name": "Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e62c4d8f-c0c2-3f38-acf7-509ceb04b63c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
