The vulnerability is due to improper handling of packets by the IPsec packet processor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious ICMP error messages to an affected device that get punted to the IPsec packet processor. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete IPsec memory, resulting in all future IPsec packets to an affected device being dropped by the device. Manual intervention is required to recover from this situation.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:35:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:36:17", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-ipsec-dos-q8UPX6m"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3190"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6dc4d521-4ce4-37ab-a0e1-d4139e147e00", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ab5c9e06-077f-3289-9e4f-2de996dda8a2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
