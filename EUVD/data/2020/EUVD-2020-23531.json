It gave authenticated attackers the ability to modify arbitrary files, including PHP files. Doing so would allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution. The xcloner_restore.php write_file_action could overwrite wp-config.php, for example. Alternatively, an attacker could create an exploit chain to obtain a database dump.", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T03:27:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:16:13", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:L/S:C/UI:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-35948", "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/09/critical-vulnerabilities-patched-in-xcloner-backup-and-restore-plugin/", "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10412", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/163336/WordPress-XCloner-4.2.12-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "https://github.com/Hacker5preme/Exploits/tree/main/Wordpress/CVE-2020-35948"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-35948"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 52.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d2013de-9bf7-3092-a544-44c599f020e0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4363acdd-353a-3d9c-8382-9c32f90ebb0b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
