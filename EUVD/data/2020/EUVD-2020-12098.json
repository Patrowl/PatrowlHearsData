An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.</p>\n<p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.</p>\n", "datePublished": "2020-09-11T17:09:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:31:59", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1218"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1218"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 12.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "150e0c5c-04c8-3150-952a-6ca35c5f88bc", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Word 2013 Service Pack 1"}, "product_version": "15.0.1 <publication"}, {"id": "1ced2803-0d83-3402-ad42-84fa011d2689", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office Online Server"}, "product_version": "16.0.1 <publication"}, {"id": "2ba60e62-3ccf-3fc6-ac58-c18d71ac6d2d", "product": {"name": "Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise"}, "product_version": "16.0.1 <https://aka.ms/OfficeSecurityReleases"}, {"id": "39623d97-4888-35bc-be6f-dac7361cfefe", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office 2019 for Mac"}, "product_version": "16.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "3f6eee3f-82a9-3d28-8816-b4475cefcda6", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 Service Pack 2"}, "product_version": "13.0.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "4e0ed21d-71f8-3b58-b7a3-b450aa775e86", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016"}, "product_version": "16.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "54f0d0f2-b809-387e-b101-f4babb2dfb00", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office Web Apps 2013 Service Pack 1"}, "product_version": "15.0.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "5d2caf6d-57a4-3637-94f7-f3bd43d6d817", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019"}, "product_version": "16.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "63654eb1-985d-301c-bf7a-6c8b681c76e5", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac"}, "product_version": "16.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "73e8d970-d2dc-30a5-8893-c8dc6f2d075c", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010 Service Pack 2"}, "product_version": "13.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "76fa4d6a-71b5-3ea7-8712-ae4152e6d8fb", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Word 2013 Service Pack 1"}, "product_version": "15.0.1 <publication"}, {"id": "841175fe-ca8f-3e12-8ccc-f161a99bb1d8", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Word 2016"}, "product_version": "16.0.1 <publication"}, {"id": "9a349341-0d89-3705-9961-ebb6bcb7d719", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2013 Service Pack 1"}, "product_version": "15.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "a8fabc04-2dfd-3970-936b-29e2e97060a2", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Word 2010 Service Pack 2"}, "product_version": "13.0.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "e405bb1c-7641-39ac-8567-17ed5fd088a1", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2"}, "product_version": "13.0.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "e91ca597-7f41-3db0-b7cd-7a00e850c835", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Office 2019"}, "product_version": "19.0.0 <https://aka.ms/OfficeSecurityReleases"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "49d7465f-a5a5-3a62-bc51-f8cd3ce60114", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
