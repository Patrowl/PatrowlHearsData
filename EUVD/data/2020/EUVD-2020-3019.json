In the ajax_calls.php file in the save_img action in the name parameter, there is no validation of what kind of extension is sent. This makes it possible to execute PHP code if a legitimate JPEG image contains this code in the EXIF data, and the .php extension is used in the name parameter. (A potential fast patch is to disable the save_img action in the config file.)", "datePublished": "2020-03-14T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:06:09", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/600", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171280/ZwiiCMS-12.2.04-Remote-Code-Execution.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10567"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 17.87, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "431b33a9-b8ad-36be-90e8-acd4fd1b974f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f8321fb8-9e87-3980-806d-dd028ab757d5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
