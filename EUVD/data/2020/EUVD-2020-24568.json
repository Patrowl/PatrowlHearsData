The attacker could obtain the privileges of the highjacked session account, which could include administrator privileges on the device. The vulnerability is due to the use of weak entropy generation for session identifier values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to determine a current session identifier through brute force and reuse that session identifier to take over an ongoing session. In this way, an attacker could take actions within the management interface with privileges up to the level of the administrative user.", "datePublished": "2020-07-02T04:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:57:52", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbswitch-session-JZAS5jnY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3297"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 5.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "65a4f0f6-93ab-337b-9525-098d7ddb042d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2e088eef-7241-393e-9d6b-0b7ef118acc9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
