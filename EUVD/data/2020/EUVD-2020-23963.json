The verification of X.509 certificates when matching the expected common name (the cn argument of mbedtls_x509_crt_verify) with the actual certificate name is mishandled: when the subjecAltName extension is present, the expected name is compared to any name in that extension regardless of its type. This means that an attacker could impersonate a 4-byte or 16-byte domain by getting a certificate for the corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 address (this would require the attacker to control that IP address, though).", "datePublished": "2021-08-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:30:08", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-36477.html", "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.24.0", "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls/issues/3498", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202301-08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-36477"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8b44abe6-1cfe-3dbf-875a-7c26c03d0236", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f013ec3-5a43-3dfc-85ca-7a25c8392129", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
