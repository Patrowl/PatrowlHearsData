The vulnerability is due to insufficient length restrictions when the onePK Topology Discovery Service parses Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol message to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges, or to cause a process crash, which could result in a reload of the device and cause a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:41:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:16:40", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-nxos-onepk-rce-6Hhyt4dC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3217"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1d995145-866a-343f-99d5-80d7c2003294", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a32c6a4-05f2-3a88-b674-71baf5339a2d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
