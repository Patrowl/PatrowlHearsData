The vulnerability is due to improper resource management for inbound SSL/TLS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing multiple SSL/TLS connections with specific conditions to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the memory on the affected device, causing the device to stop accepting new SSL/TLS connections and resulting in a DoS condition for services on the device that process SSL/TLS traffic. Manual intervention is required to recover an affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:25:01", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ssl-vpn-dos-qY7BHpjN"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3196"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.86, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f247fb7a-5831-3c04-b7fe-13b173a5226e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23b8b471-4d72-3655-ae3e-9961217be959", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
