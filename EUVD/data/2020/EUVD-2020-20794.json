The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W device has an SSH daemon included in the firmware image. By default, the SSH daemon is disabled and does not start at system boot. The system initialization scripts read a device configuration file variable to see if the SSH daemon should be started. The web interface does not provide a visible capability to alter this configuration file variable. However, a malicious actor can include this variable in a POST such that the SSH daemon will be started when the device boots.", "datePublished": "2020-11-24T17:38:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:33:58", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-28331", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160162/Barco-wePresent-Undocumented-SSH-Interface.html", "https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2020-007.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-28331"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb2ef8d3-f069-3b1f-8341-64eccd4aac76", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f13c76a-8567-34af-8a92-9bf87dd5b6da", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
