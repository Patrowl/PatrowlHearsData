The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the 802.11 GAS frames that are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted 802.11 GAS frame over the air to an access point (AP), and that frame would then be relayed to the affected WLC. Also, an attacker with Layer 3 connectivity to the WLC could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious 802.11 GAS payload in a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T20:11:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:28:32", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-gas-dos-8FsE3AWH"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3273"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d1df7dcb-182a-3bae-b387-f95918283920", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4b1a0d5e-ca8e-34c5-989e-76c755dbbea5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
