Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "datePublished": "2020-01-22T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-01-30T17:07:00", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/#security-fixes", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/575994cd42e83fd772a5f7ec98b2c56751bd3f65", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppp-gpcr-7qf6", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7j6-7hfx-5522", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/waitress/PYSEC-2020-178.yaml", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16792", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00011.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-16792.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16792", "GHSA-4ppp-gpcr-7qf6", "GHSA-j7j6-7hfx-5522", "PYSEC-2020-178"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.8, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42856693-0b40-389a-9709-5c87fee2b7ba", "product": {"name": "Waitress"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.3.1 \u22641.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cf008a72-9c56-35eb-897b-817418093a6e", "vendor": {"name": "Pylons"}}], "isExploited": false}
