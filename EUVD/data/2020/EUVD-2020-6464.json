In particular, the option `local-service` is not enabled. Running dnsmasq in this manner may inadvertently make it an open resolver accessible from any address on the internet. This flaw allows an attacker to conduct a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) against other systems.", "datePublished": "2021-02-05T23:16:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:39:36", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14312.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-14312.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1851342"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-14312"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "69233b88-0506-3b65-872c-3d6e453856ca", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
