To exploit the vulnerability, one must register with a username identical to the victim's username, but with white space inserted before and/or after the username. This will register the account with the same username as the victim. After initiating a password reset for the new account, CTFd will reset the victim's account password due to the username collision.", "datePublished": "2020-01-23T22:47:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T09:25:48", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/pull/1218", "https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/releases/tag/2.2.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-7245"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "860e6a7e-a47c-3557-948e-b4c1445a2d7b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "877096d1-48fd-3dbd-8616-0b380e3d6688", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
