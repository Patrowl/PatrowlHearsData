The vulnerability is due to an internal state not being represented correctly in the SSH state machine, which leads to an unexpected behavior. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating an SSH connection to an affected device and using a specific traffic pattern that causes an error condition within that connection. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:45:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:12:41", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ssh-dos-Un22sd2A"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3200"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bfd99181-c026-3f71-82e3-8d030c92416a", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 12.2(58)SE"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f66ca0f3-dba7-3227-925f-5c5b7710a7e2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
