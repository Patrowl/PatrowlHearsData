It was thus possible for an authenticated user to list and access files, environment variables, and process information. Additionally it was possible to set environment variables for the current process, create and update files in folders writable by the web process, and execute arbitrary programs accessible by the web process. All other operations available to the `os` package in Python were also available, even if not explicitly enumerated in this CVE.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T13:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:21:55", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdeee068ac1e0c43bd5b69830240f30598df15a2ef9f7998c7b29131e%40%3Cdev.superset.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0e35c7c5672a6146b962840be5c1a7b7461c05a71cd7ecc62774d155@%3Cnotifications.superset.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r4fc7115f6e63ac255c48fc68c0da592df55fe4be47cae6378d39ac22@%3Cnotifications.superset.apache.org%3E", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13948", "https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/11617#issuecomment-726204489", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/apache-superset/PYSEC-2020-222.yaml", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r4fc7115f6e63ac255c48fc68c0da592df55fe4be47cae6378d39ac22%40%3Cnotifications.superset.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0e35c7c5672a6146b962840be5c1a7b7461c05a71cd7ecc62774d155%40%3Cnotifications.superset.apache.org%3E"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-13948", "PYSEC-2020-222"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.62, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96b30a3c-d1c7-3025-a482-bd6ae58a6c02", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
