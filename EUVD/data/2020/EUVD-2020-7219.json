{"id": "EUVD-2020-7219", "enisaUuid": "959605a0-f69a-3524-b9e5-832ae35c6a94", "description": "In Envoy before versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, and 1.15.0 when validating TLS certificates, Envoy would incorrectly allow a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of *.example.com, Envoy would incorrectly allow nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow subdomain.example.com. This defect applies to both validating a client TLS certificate in mTLS, and validating a server TLS certificate for upstream connections. This vulnerability is only applicable to situations where an untrusted entity can obtain a signed wildcard TLS certificate for a domain of which you only intend to trust a subdomain of. For example, if you intend to trust api.mysubdomain.example.com, and an untrusted actor can obtain a signed TLS certificate for *.example.com or *.com. Configurations are vulnerable if they use verify_subject_alt_name in any Envoy version, or if they use match_subject_alt_names in version 1.14 or later. This issue has been fixed in Envoy versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, 1.15.0.", "datePublished": "2020-07-14T22:05:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15104.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3090", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-15104.html", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-w5f5-6qhq-hhrg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15104"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0ae8ea6e-1c1b-3768-a5b7-d0c966c256e3", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.13.0, < 1.13.4"}, {"id": "4dbdeb6e-b8cd-3574-8ba7-49a7bbb75bfa", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.14.0, < 1.14.4"}, {"id": "a1057670-2d47-3197-8567-8711a6113f26", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "< 1.12.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "56fafa6b-ee48-3a66-b7b3-67591f46aebf", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
