The signature information and the node/object that is signed can be in different places and thus the signature verification will succeed, but the wrong data will be used. This specifically affects the verification of assertion that have been signed.", "datePublished": "2020-01-13T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-01-27T18:15:00", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/releases/tag/v5.0.0", "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/commit/f27c7e7a7010f83380566a219fd6a290a00f2b6e", "https://pypi.org/project/pysaml2/5.0.0/", "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/commit/5e9d5acbcd8ae45c4e736ac521fd2df5b1c62e25", "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/releases", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4245-1/", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4630", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/02/msg00025.html", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qf7v-8hj3-4xw7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5390", "https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500-2020-01-13", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pysaml2/PYSEC-2020-94.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-5390.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-5390"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5390", "GHSA-qf7v-8hj3-4xw7", "PYSEC-2020-94"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e4832648-7ccd-3e27-9129-54054e9d6595", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "19698e16-3d24-32a1-a069-8a09d27ee359", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
