The code for IPv6 fragment reassembly tries to access a previous fragment starting from a network incoming fragment that still doesn't have a reference to the previous one (which supposedly resides in the reassembly list). When faced with an incoming fragment that belongs to a non-empty fragment list, IPv6 reassembly must check that there are no empty holes between the fragments: this leads to an uninitialized pointer dereference in _fnet_ip6_reassembly in fnet_ip6.c, and causes Denial-of-Service.", "datePublished": "2020-12-11T22:39:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:53:17", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-17469.html", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128", "https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-343-01", "http://fnet.sourceforge.net/manual/fnet_history.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-17469"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "45b086d1-df38-3cb6-87d7-c57520b21650", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9ecbba03-87c9-31b1-87b1-8043c716f5e4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
