In particular, there is no validation that the `splits` tensor has the minimum required number of elements. Code uses this quantity to initialize a different data structure. Since `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector, it needs to have at least one element to not be `nullptr`. If user passes a `splits` tensor that is empty or has exactly one element, we get a `SIGABRT` signal raised by the operating system. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.", "datePublished": "2020-09-25T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-09-01T08:19:33", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-x5cp-9pcf-pp3h", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15199", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2020-279.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2020-314.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2020-122.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15199", "GHSA-x5cp-9pcf-pp3h", "PYSEC-2020-279"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d56d2666-4aa2-3ae4-9e63-f09127ecde54", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "= 2.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fbeda366-b03e-3639-bcf1-ee35fce04c93", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
