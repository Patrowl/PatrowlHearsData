The vulnerability is due to improper input sanitization. An attacker who has valid administrative access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device, which could lead to complete system compromise.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:40:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:17:56", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-web-cmdinj4-S2TmH7GA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3211"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4fb3d672-1379-3899-a9a9-2fbfe7f184d7", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software 16.10.1"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f180c3eb-0863-3feb-b4d3-65ad69e9437f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
