The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Webex player application to crash when trying to view the malicious file.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:00:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:20:07", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvs98269"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3322"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5382afc2-204a-367d-b491-193f387a2787", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0 MR3"}, {"id": "ab241b5a-bdeb-3ee4-b521-7eded5e2ea19", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0 MR3"}, {"id": "ba892103-358b-3d8b-9093-ce28c27eee1e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2"}, {"id": "d39bd85d-09c2-388f-bbbf-54b065585b37", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e0a308c-efc6-3ec5-b3ce-2cbc8194198f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
