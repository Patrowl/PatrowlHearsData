This flaw allows an attacker to leverage this issue by creating a symlink point to a target folder, which then has its ownership transferred to the new home directory's unprivileged user.", "datePublished": "2020-05-27T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:14:14", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10737.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4687", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-10737.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-10737", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10737", "https://pagure.io/oddjob/c/10b8aaa1564b723a005b53acc069df71313f4cac?branch"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10737"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c2c1097-2443-36a6-9bb7-be8e78372525", "product": {"name": "oddjob"}, "product_version": "before 0.34.6"}, {"id": "c56621a8-6d8c-3f43-b031-2c3ca1fa40e5", "product": {"name": "oddjob"}, "product_version": "before 0.34.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "560b5687-daf5-373c-b544-3d9a90eb097f", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
