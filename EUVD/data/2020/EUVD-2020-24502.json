The vulnerability exists because broadcast traffic that is received on the 802.1X-enabled port is mishandled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending broadcast traffic on the port before being authenticated. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send and receive broadcast traffic on the 802.1X-enabled port before authentication.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:42:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:13:50", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c2960L-DpWA9Re4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3231"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9fabddbf-442e-3dc1-959e-0a1d530e6bc3", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 15.2(5a)E"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9e970643-7042-344f-aee6-b4bb4e3c823f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
