An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>\n<p>Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of the Windows Camera Codec Pack. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Camera Codec Pack handles objects in memory.</p>\n", "datePublished": "2020-10-16T22:18:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:45:34", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16967"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-16967"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 12.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "16476a91-63f3-37a5-8800-b60ae5b6f668", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "5258ad30-3cf4-3949-bd10-d60f5a7ede4b", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 2004"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "6f391491-2043-31af-b107-911dcb4f8150", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1507"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "75db14fa-3064-30fb-92b4-2ebc01b4ecbc", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1709 for 32-bit Systems"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "7da2644f-6c45-3f9a-ae20-c7f223de9bde", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1903 for 32-bit Systems"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "7f6b0eb6-7674-3d29-b80d-6d5754a9b8f3", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1803"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "9427d061-e0a8-3e82-8ec6-6edd6c7fc683", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1809"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "b28341c2-79df-3173-99e9-848a66b068a4", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1909"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "baf557b7-07fa-3d47-89a4-7eec1b702547", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1903 for ARM64-based Systems"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "c0a53d4c-f11e-3ee1-aba3-636b373cde64", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1607"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "ef1da0c6-7ce1-3e22-b75a-af3b4938d986", "product": {"name": "Windows 10 Version 1709"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "821c9ce2-c9d4-3a73-9313-ff017eef9d99", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
