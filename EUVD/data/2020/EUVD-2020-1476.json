{"id": "EUVD-2020-1476", "enisaUuid": "8c42c8ab-b936-360f-ab31-ffdde4200b61", "description": "URI.js is a javascript URL mutation library (npm package urijs). In URI.js before version 1.19.4, the hostname can be spoofed by using a backslash (`\\`) character followed by an at (`@`) character. If the hostname is used in security decisions, the decision may be incorrect. Depending on library usage and attacker intent, impacts may include allow/block list bypasses, SSRF attacks, open redirects, or other undesired behavior. For example the URL `https://expected-example.com\\@observed-example.com` will incorrectly return `observed-example.com` if using an affected version. Patched versions correctly return `expected-example.com`. Patched versions match the behavior of other parsers which implement the WHATWG URL specification, including web browsers and Node's built-in URL class. Version 1.19.4 is patched against all known payload variants. Version 1.19.3 has a partial patch but is still vulnerable to a payload variant.]", "datePublished": "2020-12-30T23:40:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:03", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/security/advisories/GHSA-3329-pjwv-fjpg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26291", "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/commit/b02bf037c99ac9316b77ff8bfd840e90becf1155", "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js", "https://github.com/medialize/URI.js/releases/tag/v1.19.4", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1595", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/urijs", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3917"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26291", "GHSA-3329-pjwv-fjpg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12170a01-1695-35b6-ba34-fd0b8651ad37", "product": {"name": "URI.js"}, "product_version": "< 1.19.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "173b69b3-0e7b-36a6-8e9b-e5749d9d2545", "vendor": {"name": "medialize"}}], "isExploited": false}
