The vulnerability is due to the system memory not being properly freed for a VPN System Logging event generated when a VPN session is created or deleted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly creating or deleting a VPN tunnel connection, which could leak a small amount of system memory for each logging event. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause system memory depletion, which can lead to a systemwide denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker does not have any control of whether VPN System Logging is configured or not on the device, but it is enabled by default.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:25:31", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-dos-Rdpe34sd8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3189"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7c946bdc-487e-3505-a838-de30d4471775", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "20953087-e600-345c-a560-bbd01b9bab70", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
