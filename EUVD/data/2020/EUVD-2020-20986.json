More specifically, this issue has been introduced in v5.1-rc4 (commit 631b7abacd02b88f4b0795c08b54ad4fc3e7c7c0) and is still present in v5.10-rc4, so it\u2019s likely that all versions in between are affected. An attacker can read /proc/pid/syscall to trigger this vulnerability, which leads to the kernel leaking memory contents.", "datePublished": "2021-05-10T18:54:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:40:59", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-28588.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-28588", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-28588.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-28588.html", "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1211"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-28588"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f673278e-d141-3649-a772-66613ae96ead", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
