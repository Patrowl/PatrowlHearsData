The attacker must have valid credentials on the device.The vulnerability exists because a configuration file that is used at container startup has insufficient protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a specific container configuration file on the underlying file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges within the host namespace. This could allow the attacker to impact other running Cisco FTD instances or the host Cisco FXOS device.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:35:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:49:45", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-container-esc-FmYqFBQV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3514"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "85857b05-60b8-3bbb-9004-dfa97cc49a30", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "076994ef-5f0c-3328-ae73-9ab7f3fef102", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
