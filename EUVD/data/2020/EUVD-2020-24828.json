The vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted data stream to the host input daemon of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the host input daemon to restart. The attacker could use repeated attacks to cause the daemon to continuously reload, creating a DoS condition for the API.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:41:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:45:42", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-dos-3WymYWKh"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3557"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d79d1b4-d50b-3169-9342-5388526a359b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17f662c7-c8d5-3e5e-ae85-0aacad2f1bd5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
