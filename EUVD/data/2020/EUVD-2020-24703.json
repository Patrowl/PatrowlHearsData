An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to a target file on a specific path. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt the contents of the file. If the file is a critical systems file, the exploit could lead to a denial of service condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the system.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-11T23:56:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-26T18:00:06", "baseScore": 5.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-3432", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-mac-dos-36s2y3Lv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3432"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6f3f5f37-1692-3756-9f4c-2dde0fed3f91", "product": {"name": "Cisco Secure Client"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8e5bf47-54e6-35a4-813d-677f7224b225", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
