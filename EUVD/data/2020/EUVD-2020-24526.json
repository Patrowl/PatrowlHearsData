The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of IPv4 or IPv6 traffic through an affected device. This traffic would need to match a configured block action in an access control policy. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition on the affected device, which would result in a DoS for traffic transiting the device, as well as sluggish performance of the management interface. Once the flood is stopped, performance should return to previous states.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:24:20", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-dos-N2vQZASR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3255"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "de9998c6-cf90-3793-92ff-8e5a8c77688c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1396f63a-83c1-38a7-a1f5-a941e36b5287", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
