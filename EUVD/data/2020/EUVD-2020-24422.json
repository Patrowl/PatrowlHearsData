The vulnerability is due to insufficient security mechanisms in the restricted shell implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and execute a set of normally unauthorized commands with the privileges of a non-root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:16:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:10:41", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cmx-rshell-esc-L6hBwjbg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3151"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81585c27-968b-395d-a75c-5f2fe03f7e29", "product": {"name": "Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "45aae391-0b5c-3042-9f13-5a5fa7e62379", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
