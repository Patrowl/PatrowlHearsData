For example, a small amount of sniffed data may indicate that a vote was cast for the candidate with the least metadata. An active man-in-the-middle attacker can leverage this behavior to disrupt voters' abilities to vote for a candidate opposed by the attacker.", "datePublished": "2020-02-13T20:46:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T10:19:19", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SecurityAnalysisOfVoatz_Public.pdf", "https://blog.voatz.com/?p=1209"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-8989"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7313fb17-f1e8-3059-800c-dde80a46a92b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1ee7fad0-af4c-35e4-b749-1131d523bf9f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
