The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on Lua function calls within the context of user-supplied Lua scripts. An attacker with valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious Lua script. When this file is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition could occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux OS of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:01:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:56:35", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-lua-rce-7VeJX4f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3423"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c385a58e-35a5-36d7-a912-5847baac86c1", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software 3.7.0S"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4679ecb-96b9-3e64-89d4-35aad76b8c40", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
