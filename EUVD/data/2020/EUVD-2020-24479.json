The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions on the area of code that manages the image verification feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the targeted device and then logging in to the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker could then, from the VDS shell, disable Cisco IOS Software integrity (image) verification. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious Cisco IOS Software image on the targeted device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:40:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:18:33", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3208"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "99c6342b-21d6-34db-b11e-e668b86186c7", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 12.2(60)EZ16"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dac948d5-6fc3-32f9-9177-854d7bcfee35", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
