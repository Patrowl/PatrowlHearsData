If users expose apollo-adminservice to internet(which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since apollo-adminservice is designed to work in intranet and it doesn't have access control built-in. Malicious hackers may access apollo-adminservice apis directly to access/edit the application's configurations. To fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that do not expose apollo-adminservice to internet.", "datePublished": "2020-09-10T18:40:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/security/advisories/GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15170", "https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/pull/3233/commits/ae9ba6cfd32ed80469f162e5e3583e2477862ddf", "https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15170", "GHSA-xpmx-h7xq-xffh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "401ac37c-3166-36e4-b9ee-fa8df57f0018", "product": {"name": "Apollo"}, "product_version": "<1.7.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "76d0bae4-8615-3371-8728-c63016fb8ba4", "vendor": {"name": "ctripcorp"}}], "isExploited": false}
