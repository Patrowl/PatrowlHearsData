The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:15:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:08:51", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-stack-vUxHmnNz"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3288"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c03d880b-97f1-377f-a679-fb65d86b9310", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd6d80ca-965d-30aa-a439-a328fd7a25a6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
