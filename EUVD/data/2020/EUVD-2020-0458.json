This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466 (v1.0.466).", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T22:00:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:22:09", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5299", "https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c84bf03f506052c848f2fddc05f24be631427a1a", "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/802d8c8e09a2b342649393edb6d3ceb958851484", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158730/October-CMS-Build-465-XSS-File-Read-File-Deletion-CSV-Injection.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/2", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-5299"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5299", "GHSA-4rhm-m2fp-hx7q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "86f7f6b2-6fb3-3d37-91ef-ffcfa6714617", "product": {"name": "October"}, "product_version": "1.0.319, < 1.0.466"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e431630-d2b7-3b46-a26d-b977125e8466", "vendor": {"name": "octobercms"}}], "isExploited": false}
