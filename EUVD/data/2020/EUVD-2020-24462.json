The vulnerability is due to improper length validation of a field in an IPv6 DNS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS query over IPv6, which traverses the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to DNS over IPv6 traffic only.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:25:21", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ipv6-67pA658k"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3191"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "95c0fa07-6b6b-3b05-953e-7a6305f7d2f3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "062a4fe7-0b68-36eb-bf30-df06ba4e6708", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
