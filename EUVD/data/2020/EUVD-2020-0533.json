This includes the possibility to fetch typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, which again contains the encryptionKey as well as credentials of the database management system being used. In case a database server is directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows the ability to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom extensions. This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.", "datePublished": "2020-07-29T16:15:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-3x94-fv5h-5q2c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms-core/CVE-2020-15099.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms/CVE-2020-15099.yaml", "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15099", "GHSA-3x94-fv5h-5q2c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9c91b359-7e47-3b7c-949b-1b42e520ed1a", "product": {"name": "TYPO3 CMS"}, "product_version": "9.0.0, < 9.5.20"}, {"id": "ae23b7ae-2170-3d73-889c-bd3d064de472", "product": {"name": "TYPO3 CMS"}, "product_version": "10.0.0, 10.4.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0218e8e1-1111-3bfb-9264-0faa318eea1d", "vendor": {"name": "TYPO3"}}], "isExploited": false}
