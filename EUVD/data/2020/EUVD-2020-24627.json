The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by interacting with the interface in a way that injects malicious content in a log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:16:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:05:48", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-stored-xss-eUyGPqxm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3356"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "469cbeb3-f530-320c-9231-9509354c7f7d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8181fb64-88d3-3e07-b9b1-d01fa4ba85a5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
