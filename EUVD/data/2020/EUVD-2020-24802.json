The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly authenticate REST API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) token and then using the token with REST API requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the back-end database of the affected device and read, alter, or drop information.", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T17:41:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:37:22", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-FND-BCK-GHkPNZ5F"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3531"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 4.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fedfad6b-f2dc-3ec3-acb6-d9d77f264c8d", "product": {"name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "76a6899b-e9ac-34bb-93b5-6b5c5eb98519", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
