The vulnerability is due to inadequate parsing mechanisms for specific email body components. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email containing a high number of shortened URLs through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume processing resources, causing a DoS condition on an affected device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, certain conditions beyond the control of the attacker must occur.", "datePublished": "2020-02-19T19:16:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:40:08", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-shrt-dos-wM54R8qA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3132"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3f6e54f-8217-3a71-ab5f-1a46784c8b63", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b210799-b16d-3cf0-8877-9e6737e7ffc3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
