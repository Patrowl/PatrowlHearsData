The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-07-02T12:43:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:57:04", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-cuc-imp-xss-OWuSYAp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3282"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "daa620b9-14d0-3afd-831c-94326a5cdeff", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ee660a45-7e6d-3a28-a657-ecf8bd778785", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
