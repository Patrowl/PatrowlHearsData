User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 2.22.7 and was fixed in 2.22.7, 2.21.15, and 2.20.24. The underlying issues contributing to this vulnerability were identified through the GitHub Security Bug Bounty program.", "datePublished": "2021-03-03T03:25:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:06:09", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.20/admin/release-notes#2.20.24", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.21/admin/release-notes#2.21.15", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@2.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.7", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.20/admin/release-notes#2.20.24", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.21/admin/release-notes#2.21.15", "https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server%402.22/admin/release-notes#2.22.7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10519"], "assigner": "GitHub_P", "epss": 1.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72624b56-e2be-32a9-b1c9-5622b60f2b7a", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2.20 <2.20.24"}, {"id": "776dc066-893f-3773-9406-cb261886f5b9", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2.22 <2.22.7"}, {"id": "d8e3e5e8-e9b3-3d69-8d9f-1578f29cd73e", "product": {"name": "GitHub Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2.21 <2.21.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f4a3a3dd-26e9-33e9-bd55-5be66db6215a", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
