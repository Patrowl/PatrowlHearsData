When configured with cookies authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set the SameSite value, allowing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and consequently allowing a cross-site WebSocket hijack on Theia IDE. This flaw allows an attacker to gain full access to the victim's workspace through the /services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker conducts a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into executing a request via an untrusted link, which performs the CSRF and the Socket hijack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "datePublished": "2020-12-14T20:05:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:46:33", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1823892"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-14368"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8828ae8e-8833-30ea-a890-6e0d3c59f533", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
