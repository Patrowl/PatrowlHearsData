The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reboot of the switch, leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.", "datePublished": "2020-08-17T18:01:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:14:20", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbss-ipv6-dos-3bLk6vA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3363"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4832f2e9-5f1e-3920-b177-133bcda172fe", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 250 Series Smart Switches Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b0a619c0-a66d-3e26-a4d4-e31b0fe74e09", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
