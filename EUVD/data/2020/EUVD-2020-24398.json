The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements within a Webex recording that is stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious ARF or WRF file to a user through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:40:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:35:37", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200304-webex-player", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-269/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3127"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8bd3fdd6-5e3c-3eb0-94d3-df4415937910", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx WRF Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4f12639-d0eb-3836-b30f-ff800bb48400", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
