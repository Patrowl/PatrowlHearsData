The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco ISE Software releases 2.7.0 and later contains the fix for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T17:50:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:42:24", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-DxJsRWRx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3149"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3b47fd6b-3e94-3d92-bb5f-496a2176c122", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f290bdc7-7ce9-362b-90d7-d5776d14eb2f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
