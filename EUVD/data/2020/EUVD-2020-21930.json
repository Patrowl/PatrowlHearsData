Some OSes (such as Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD) are processing watch events using a single thread. If the events are received faster than the thread is able to handle, they will get queued. As the queue is unbounded, a guest may be able to trigger an OOM in the backend. All systems with a FreeBSD, Linux, or NetBSD (any version) dom0 are vulnerable.", "datePublished": "2020-12-15T16:52:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:55:10", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-29568.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4843", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-29568", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2020-29568.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-29568.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-349.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00018.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00010.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-29568"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5f223cd6-ad71-3940-b959-7f5a085bb0e6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "13ac5592-c1a4-317a-a1c5-cd262e869498", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
