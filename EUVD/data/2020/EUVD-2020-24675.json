The vulnerability is due to insufficient enforcement of the consent token in authorizing shell access. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the persistent Telnet/SSH CLI on an affected device and requesting shell access. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain shell access on the affected device and execute commands on the underlying OS with root privileges.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:02:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:54:59", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-ctbypass-7QHAfHkK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3404"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f2d7e14e-f384-35ca-99bd-b332637e1ab8", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f9c503ce-e3cf-35f7-b52d-dc0953a3d36a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
