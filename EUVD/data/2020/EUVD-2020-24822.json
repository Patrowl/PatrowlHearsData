The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:16:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:43:31", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xss-euRCwX9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3551"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c180a586-87b3-34dc-955b-de31d57369bc", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "30fd6c07-decc-37fa-a5b8-fa0d24efd634", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
