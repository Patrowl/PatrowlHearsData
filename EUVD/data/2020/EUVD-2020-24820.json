The vulnerability is due to insufficient sftunnel negotiation protection during initial device registration. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a specific flow of the sftunnel communication between an FMC device and an FTD device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt and modify the sftunnel communication between FMC and FTD devices, allowing the attacker to modify configuration data sent from an FMC device to an FTD device or alert data sent from an FTD device to an FMC device.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:35:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:50:32", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftdfmc-sft-mitm-tc8AzFs2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3549"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cdefbd3c-19aa-3c07-8695-19f19ee4fe17", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4c924782-52f6-3166-9ef0-07c7ae7aae9b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
