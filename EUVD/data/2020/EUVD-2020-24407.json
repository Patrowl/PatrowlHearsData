The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of the affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information. This vulnerability affects Cisco Jabber Guest releases 11.1(2) and earlier.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:30:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:47:15", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-guest-xss-6urXhkqv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3136"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82e603eb-13e2-383e-a214-524aa31ca0c8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Jabber Guest"}, "product_version": "before 11.1(3)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c4f8dddf-ce5b-3cf0-ba82-c9f490feccec", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
