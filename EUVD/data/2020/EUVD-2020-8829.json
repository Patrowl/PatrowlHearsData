These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions within Dynamics Server on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.</p>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that Dynamics Server properly sanitizes web requests.</p>\n", "datePublished": "2020-09-11T17:08:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:45:33", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16871"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-16871"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "335f2d28-d3b2-3fcc-8618-a8086a9f27f4", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises) version 9.0"}, "product_version": "9.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "6888b83b-684e-3d82-aed2-4e8a8cdcc66b", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises) version 8.2"}, "product_version": "8.0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ad40522-a617-3659-8525-37e1018df4d4", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
