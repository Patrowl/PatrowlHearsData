The vulnerability occurs because the BGP MD5 authentication is bypassed if the peer does not have MD5 authentication configured, the NX-OS device does have BGP MD5 authentication configured, and the NX-OS BGP virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) name is configured to be greater than 19 characters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to establish a BGP session with the NX-OS peer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a BGP session with the NX-OS device without MD5 authentication. The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly configured peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer. To do so, the attacker must obtain information about the BGP peers in the affected system&rsquo;s trusted network.", "datePublished": "2020-02-26T16:45:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:39:00", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-nxos-bgpmd5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3165"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b4e42496-8e82-355a-950a-9a09e39c188a", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "9.2(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9630b53a-c0a5-34de-9873-65b08c99d9bb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
