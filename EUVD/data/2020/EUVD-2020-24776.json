{"id": "EUVD-2020-24776", "enisaUuid": "89c04013-192a-3ffd-86c1-cd5ed2172d28", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol of Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to continuously consume memory, which could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DOS condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:15:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:12:46", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cdp-memleak-k5Z7m55t"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3505"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "25c0527a-d351-3628-889c-9fecb0bbb949", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "40824c03-bbe7-30b9-97da-8c7c0befb5b4", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
