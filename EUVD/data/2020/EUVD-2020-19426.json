While claiming on-chain a received HTLC output, it didn't verify that the corresponding outgoing off-chain HTLC was already settled before releasing the preimage. In the case of a hash-and-amount collision with an invoice, the preimage for an expected payment was instead released. A malicious peer could have deliberately intercepted an HTLC intended for the victim node, probed the preimage through a colluding relayed HTLC, and stolen the intercepted HTLC. The impact is a loss of funds in certain situations, and a weakening of the victim's receiver privacy.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T02:00:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:03:23", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://gist.github.com/ariard/6bdeb995565d1cc292753e1ee4ae402d", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002857.html", "https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-October/002855.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26896"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "83bfb917-6d8a-3172-9482-a83834fd855a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b3ed593-2d7a-3efc-bff5-517ab0868298", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
