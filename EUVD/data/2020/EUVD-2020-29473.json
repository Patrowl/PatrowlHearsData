{"id": "EUVD-2020-29473", "enisaUuid": "40bb825a-77db-3b49-a20b-ba3d97af0f62", "description": "BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch", "datePublished": "2021-02-17T22:40:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:40:02", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-8625.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4857", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0922", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0727", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0694", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0693", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0692", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0691", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0672", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0671", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0670", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0669", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-8625", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-8625.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-8625", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2020-8625.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-8625.html", "https://kb.isc.org/v1/docs/cve-2020-8625", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/19/1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00029.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/02/20/2", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-195/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QWCMBOSZOJIIET7BWTRYS3HLX5TSDKHX/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KYXAF7G45RXDVNUTWWCI2CVTHRZ67LST/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210319-0001/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EBTPWRQWRQEJNWY4NHO4WLS4KLJ3ERHZ/", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-8625"], "assigner": "isc", "epss": 1.65, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "15c6bbb0-3314-3d9b-bd3e-3ad393ec769f", "product": {"name": "BIND9"}, "product_version": "Development Branch 9.17 9.17.0 through versions before 9.17.2"}, {"id": "42adcb62-7a89-3a5e-8a7d-5c5a920258eb", "product": {"name": "BIND9"}, "product_version": "Supported Preview Branch 9.16-S 9.16.8-S1 through versions before 9.16.12-S1"}, {"id": "7973c0fc-39f9-38a9-9b96-a97aa56d5701", "product": {"name": "BIND9"}, "product_version": "Open Source Branches 9.5 though 9.11 9.5.0 through versions before 9.11.28"}, {"id": "b67bfa93-004c-3a58-afbf-5852089b25aa", "product": {"name": "BIND9"}, "product_version": "Supported Preview Branch 9.11-S 9.11.3-S1 through versions before 9.11.28-S1"}, {"id": "c61a2087-7986-3570-9e0f-12df1319e9d2", "product": {"name": "BIND9"}, "product_version": "Open Source Branches 9.12 though 9.16 9.12.0 through versions before 9.16.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9fb8ad9-40bb-3ce8-a6b2-bf6b0b0a16ef", "vendor": {"name": "ISC"}}], "isExploited": false}
