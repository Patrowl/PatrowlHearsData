It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. Any user in the system is allowed to access the interprocess communication channel AternityAgentAssistantIpc, retrieve a serialized object and call object methods remotely. Among others, the methods allow any user to: (1) Create and/or overwrite arbitrary XML files across the system; (2) Create arbitrary directories across the system; and (3) Load arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory and execute code contained in them.", "datePublished": "2020-07-27T13:36:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:22:30", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem", "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15593"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6aefaee6-ca58-3039-ba7f-2691fc16e163", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f49e023c-bd79-3535-8be7-67f11a4281cf", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
