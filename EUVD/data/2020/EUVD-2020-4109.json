If there is a TCP connection (negotiated with SNI over HTTPS) to *.example.com, a request for a domain concurrently configured explicitly (e.g., abc.example.com) is sent to the server(s) listening behind *.example.com. The outcome should instead be 421 Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users. If a victim is interacting with abc.example.com, and a server (for abc.example.com) recycles the TCP connection to the forward proxy, the victim's browser may suddenly start sending sensitive data to a *.example.com server. This occurs because the forward proxy between the victim and the origin server reuses connections (which obeys the specification), but neither Istio nor Envoy corrects this by sending a 421 error. Similarly, this behavior voids the security model browsers have put in place between domains.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T01:05:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:41:59", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=954160#c5", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/6767", "https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/9429", "https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/13589"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11767"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "95a27771-1579-385e-bf06-5ad066a8043a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "07c36b06-19d9-3f6b-a4e6-a7e0ef40f84c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
