The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied application packages. An attacker who can upload a malicious package within Cisco IOx could exploit the vulnerability to modify arbitrary files. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not affect the device that is hosting Cisco IOx.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:56:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:11:23", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-caf-3dXM8exv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3238"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cfab7ec8-b701-3ab6-8d29-949e6a1c9db8", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOx"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8732f92f-c280-3c96-bcb7-43803420dd04", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
