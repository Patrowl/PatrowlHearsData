Ansible Tower uses the token to provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower. This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4 and Ansible Tower versions before 3.5.6.", "datePublished": "2021-05-27T18:46:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:06:11", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1824033"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10709"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "97de2fca-de54-3582-b8f3-2fea14044bbd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
