An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Wininit.dll properly handles objects in memory.</p>\n", "datePublished": "2020-09-11T17:08:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:24:59", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1012"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1012"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 15.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7aebf808-f91f-3f5e-b43a-cc73967111fe", "product": {"name": "Internet Explorer 11"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "988b84f1-b86c-3c44-a8bc-9b125393c2d8", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
