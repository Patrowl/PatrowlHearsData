{"id": "EUVD-2020-4081", "enisaUuid": "46ddaa5b-39fa-301d-bf06-01d91eb5ed80", "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of missing memory barriers in read-write unlock paths. The read-write unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In other words, the unlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses within the \"critical\" section. As a consequence, it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance, there is a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.", "datePublished": "2020-04-14T12:17:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:41:59", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11739.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4723", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-11739", "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-314.html", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-314.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/14/2", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YMAW7D2MP6RE4BFI5BZWOBBWGY3VSOFN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5M2XRNCHOGGTJQBZQJ7DCV6ZNAKN3LE2/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00006.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NVTP4OYHCTRU3ONFJOFJQVNDFB25KLLG/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11739"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a840c318-219c-3528-aaca-7f4a35a239dd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ef36b048-dca4-3101-85ea-aff6d3f618f3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
