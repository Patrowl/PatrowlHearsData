The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:17:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:41:07", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-nbr-NOS6FQ24", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-1363/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3604"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9717d1a4-39cd-36a9-b301-58e7a266d70f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2e8d5795-9f4f-3ea6-97fc-46cad735d84c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
