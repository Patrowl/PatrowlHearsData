A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before it validates the received DNS entries. A remote attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to cause an overflow in a heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the code execute memcpy() with a negative size in get_rdata() and cause a crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T15:25:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:12:11", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25683.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4844", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0152", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0151", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0150", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25683", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-25683.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-25683", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-25683.html", "https://www.jsof-tech.com/disclosures/dnspooq/", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1882018", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYW3IR6APUSKOYKL5FT3ACTIHWHGQY32/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-17", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGB7HL3OWHTLEPSMLDGOMXQKG3KM2QME/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00027.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25683", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGB7HL3OWHTLEPSMLDGOMXQKG3KM2QME", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYW3IR6APUSKOYKL5FT3ACTIHWHGQY32", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/434904"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-25683"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 31.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "de5762ee-9751-309e-b3ab-1eb618ea14c1", "product": {"name": "dnsmasq"}, "product_version": "dnsmasq 2.83"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6f7ad05f-a856-3c83-a29c-a08ad2927310", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
