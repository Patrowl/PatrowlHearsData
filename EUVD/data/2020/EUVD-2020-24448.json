The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the TAPS interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the TAPS interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files in the system.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T20:10:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:31:41", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-taps-path-trav-pfsFO93r"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3177"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c18d6307-ba6c-34fa-a6c8-c8fd7f8634ed", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d3e144a4-634f-3901-b075-45aa4beed2d8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
