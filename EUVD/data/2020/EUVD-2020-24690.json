This vulnerability is due to improper handling of authentication tokens by a vulnerable Webex site. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Cisco Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit requires the attacker to have access to join a Webex meeting, including applicable meeting join links and passwords. The attacker could then exploit this vulnerability to join meetings, without appearing in the participant list, while having full access to audio, video, chat, and screen sharing capabilities.", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T17:41:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:38:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-auth-token-3vg57A5r"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3419"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b411ece4-d9c9-359f-992a-c438bbb8ae2a", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b413b6fc-95cc-3c11-bdb1-2c40f8cbc9f9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
