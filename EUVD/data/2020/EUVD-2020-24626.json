The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need administrative credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:16:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:05:58", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-stored-xss-yJyqBJGU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3355"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9ae53999-42f1-3d70-9907-6adf10e3862f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6363b44a-e717-306a-8d9f-838682e881dc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
