{"id": "EUVD-2020-18346", "enisaUuid": "750d3f70-22d0-354e-bd06-44c868a9c86b", "description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query() if the reply destination address/port is used by the pending forwarded queries. However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve the exact forwarded query, substantially reducing the number of attempts an attacker on the network would have to perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which specifies a query's attributes that all must be used to match a reply. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If chained with CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T15:22:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:12:12", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25684.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4844", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0401", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0395", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0245", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0240", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0156", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0155", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0154", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0153", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0152", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0151", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0150", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25684", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-25684.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-25684", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-25684.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1889686", "https://www.jsof-tech.com/disclosures/dnspooq/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYW3IR6APUSKOYKL5FT3ACTIHWHGQY32/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-17", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGB7HL3OWHTLEPSMLDGOMXQKG3KM2QME/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00027.html", "https://www.arista.com/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisories/12135-security-advisory-61", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25684", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGB7HL3OWHTLEPSMLDGOMXQKG3KM2QME", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYW3IR6APUSKOYKL5FT3ACTIHWHGQY32", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/434904"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-25684"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ebbf753-99e3-3006-af5e-489b6221f753", "product": {"name": "dnsmasq"}, "product_version": "dnsmasq 2.83"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b28a63c4-66a5-3b5b-a4f1-d18994237a15", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
