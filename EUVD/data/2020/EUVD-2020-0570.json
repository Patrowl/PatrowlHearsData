The responsible code is getExtensionIdForOpcode in serialization/sb3.js. The use of _ is incompatible with a protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were split and consequently deserialization attacks were prevented. NOTE: the scratch.mit.edu hosted service is not affected because of the lack of worker scripts.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T14:41:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:32:14", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14000", "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/pull/2476", "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/pull/2476/commits/90b9da45f4084958535338d1c4d71a22d6136aab", "https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm", "https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/422904/?page=1#post-4223443"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-14000", "GHSA-vc9j-fhvv-8vrf"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 6.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f7a54ed9-9e59-3176-84fa-8a0276378a15", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5eefd7e4-3430-3415-95ef-cf3d802846cc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
