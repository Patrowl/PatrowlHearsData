The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during CAPWAP packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP packet to an affected device, resulting in a buffer over-read. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:02:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:54:32", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-capwap-dos-ShFzXf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3399"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66227cab-d4da-33fc-b21e-e91224b3ec60", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b58f1639-ae09-3c23-8a1c-375b5bb15558", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
