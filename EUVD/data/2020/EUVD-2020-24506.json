The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when the software processes specific SNMP object identifiers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: To exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability by using SNMPv3, the attacker must know the user credentials for the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:55:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:11:46", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snmp-dos-USxSyTk5", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3235"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db1e807a-a116-39b6-aed0-4fed810ad8cd", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 12.2(53)SG1"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bfcfb21f-c30b-3f84-8943-94ae2ec9ae20", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
