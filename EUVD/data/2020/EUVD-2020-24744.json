The vulnerability is due to incorrect mapping of a command to task groups within the source code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the local CLI shell on the device and using the CLI command to bypass the task group&ndash;based checks. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges and perform actions on the device without authorization checks.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:26:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:07:53", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-LJtNFjeN"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3473"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72b67770-3a36-3291-8923-7bb22225fc54", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6a32fdc3-71fe-38e1-8e94-c5f8585e1f19", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
