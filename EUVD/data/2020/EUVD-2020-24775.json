The vulnerability is due to improper handling of CLI command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing specific commands on the local-mgmt CLI on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause internal system processes to fail to terminate properly, which could result in a buildup of stuck processes and lead to slowness in accessing the UCS Manager CLI and web UI. A sustained attack may result in a restart of internal UCS Manager processes and a temporary loss of access to the UCS Manager CLI and web UI.", "datePublished": "2020-08-27T15:40:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:10:32", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucs-cli-dos-GQUxCnTe"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3504"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f601b8b3-85ec-3411-b1b4-f519ce6a0a8f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e0a3dac6-a394-379e-86d5-63921208d1bb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
