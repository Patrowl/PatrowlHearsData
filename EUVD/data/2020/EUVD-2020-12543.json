{"id": "EUVD-2020-12543", "enisaUuid": "a462b41c-32fd-3134-ba2e-66236d1a06f5", "description": "Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger, and is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. Junos OS is unaffected by this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-10-16T20:31:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T16:13:35", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11078"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1681"], "assigner": "juniper", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e386fe10-d023-3309-a8ca-ae8c7a780d8f", "product": {"name": "Junos OS Evolved"}, "product_version": "all <20.1R2-EVO"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e9a70e34-2c57-3d1b-9ec5-861cba58e5fb", "vendor": {"name": "Juniper Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
