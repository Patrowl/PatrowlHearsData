Since code uses the last element of the tensor holding them to determine the dimensionality of output tensor, attackers can use a very large value to trigger a large allocation. The issue is patched in commit 204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1. A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to limit the maximum value in the segment ids tensor. This only handles the case when the segment ids are stored statically in the model, but a similar validation could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime, between inference steps. However, if the segment ids are generated as outputs of a tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.", "datePublished": "2020-09-25T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-10-01T23:15:00", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15213", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/00c7ed7ce81c2126ebc17dfe7073b5c0efd5ec0a", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a4030d8ba3692c438997c27be2dd95f3d5f54827", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2020-293.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2020-328.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2020-136.yaml", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/segment_sum.cc#L39-L44"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15213", "GHSA-hjmq-236j-8m87", "PYSEC-2020-293"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a0d18d6-4217-3481-890b-52f9d160050b", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "= 2.2.0"}, {"id": "35ad4f5d-db92-3b04-86c1-1aa1a84df1e5", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "= 2.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "729eb53c-1219-34f0-a78d-b1270291d929", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
