An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Wininit.dll properly handles objects in memory.</p>\n", "datePublished": "2020-09-11T17:09:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:39:10", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1506"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1506"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 3.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f4140003-f574-3dc4-8257-b5a56d639bb7", "product": {"name": "Internet Explorer 11"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d310eebf-9e7d-3e52-a845-cb0ad0df5777", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
