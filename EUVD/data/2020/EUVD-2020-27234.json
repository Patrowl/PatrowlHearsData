When encountering errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed, possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion. An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this vulnerability through the function rr_read_RR [5] reads the current resource record, except for the RDATA section. This is read by the loop at in rr_read. For each RR type, a different function is called. When the RR type is 0x10, the function rr_read_TXT is called at [6].", "datePublished": "2020-03-24T20:50:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:47:40", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4671", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-6080.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-6080", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-10", "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1002"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6080"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 1.08, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a0b2539b-51af-3d9b-a957-933d7dd2d93a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
