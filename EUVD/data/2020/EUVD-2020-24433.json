The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming CoAP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CoAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the CoAP server to stop, interrupting communication to the IoT endpoints.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T20:10:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:31:56", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iot-coap-dos-WTBu6YTq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3162"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "941af99a-9cbb-3792-9e57-d70fd30d219d", "product": {"name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e91bdd8c-23ed-317c-bd04-83fc9db89d93", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
