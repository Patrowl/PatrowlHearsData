The payload can be in a folder, a tag, or a document's filename. If email consumption is configured in Papermerge, a malicious document can be sent by email and is automatically uploaded into the Papermerge web application. Therefore, no authentication is required to exploit XSS if email consumption is configured. Otherwise authentication is required.", "datePublished": "2020-12-02T08:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-12-02T16:29:00", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/issues/228", "https://www.papermerge.com/", "https://github.com/ciur/papermerge/releases/tag/v1.5.2", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9w49-m7xh-5r39", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-29456", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/papermerge/PYSEC-2020-74.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-29456", "GHSA-9w49-m7xh-5r39", "PYSEC-2020-74"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ab01e465-af63-30f2-92de-8d5d7b99cf27", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a8c60da-2922-331b-97c0-b188c68e7572", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
