The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.", "datePublished": "2020-10-08T04:20:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:53:09", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-xss-xXeLFpC3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3536"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55358359-92d1-348b-914a-9d9ac3553371", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f5a0344-2c2e-3314-aa79-1d8884e87cd8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
