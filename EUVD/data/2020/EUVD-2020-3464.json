In the dialog.php page, the session variable $_SESSION['RF'][\"view_type\"] wasn't sanitized if it was already set. This made stored XSS possible if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the \"view\" action and places a payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php page. This occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the $_SESSION['RF'][\"view_type\"] variable, but there it wasn't sanitized.", "datePublished": "2020-03-30T21:52:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:21:14", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/603"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11106"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5fe79eed-22a7-39a5-8cd6-a72add8f1c8e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac6e31d5-b64c-3dd1-b090-0f912f397d08", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
