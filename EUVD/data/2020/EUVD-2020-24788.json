The attack vector is configuration dependent and could be remote or adjacent. For more information about the attack vector, see the Details section of this advisory. The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when the affected software parses Cisco Fabric Services messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious Cisco Fabric Services messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, which could result in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-08-27T15:40:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:09:30", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxos-nxos-cfs-dos-dAmnymbd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3517"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17aee30a-9b1c-3175-a48c-ecaada08dfd1", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c55fba6-0714-398b-ae79-4d07436d41c1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
