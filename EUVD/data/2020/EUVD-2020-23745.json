On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from the Installation folder. This library in turn attempts to load the /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf configuration file, which may not exist. On Windows systems, this path could translate to <drive>:\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf. A low privileged user can create a :\\usr\\local\\ssl\\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc. If the system is also an Active Directory domain controller, then this can affect the entire domain.", "datePublished": "2021-01-06T00:51:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:23:09", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:L/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:C/UI:N", "references": ["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/429301", "https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-010"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-36167"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "432bf852-e999-3489-be2f-63de31afaf81", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "784fdcb7-facf-338b-b3af-d06440ec9673", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
