The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the IP addresses that are configured on the internal interfaces of the affected device. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:25:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:09:21", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-info-disclosure-vMJMMgJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3546"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2da52d82-e122-3e54-a803-f5ed57a72911", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3dfec704-8eff-3ddf-9bf2-1ecc8e1ea260", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
