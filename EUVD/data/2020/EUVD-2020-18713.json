The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:15:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:45:14", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxs-pkjCmq9d"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26083"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cb7de400-8953-3ff3-8528-9c15d2f18d6a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d65ef91-6f26-33ad-ae68-e232b3ddeee7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
