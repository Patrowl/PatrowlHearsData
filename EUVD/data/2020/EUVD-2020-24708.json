The vulnerability is due to insufficient file scope limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specific file reference on the filesystem and then accessing it through the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:22:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:19:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-3437", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanwebid-5QWMcCvt", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162958/Cisco-SD-WAN-vManage-19.2.2-Remote-Root.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3437"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f56e964b-3b11-323e-beb4-9823f34bbeec", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e79c07b3-b4d0-3e3b-af2a-efa305c263f1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
