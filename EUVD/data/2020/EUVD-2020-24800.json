The vulnerability is due to inefficient direct memory access (DMA) memory management during the negotiation phase of an SSL VPN connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted Datagram TLS (DTLS) traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust DMA memory on the device and cause a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:35:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:50:14", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-sslvpndma-dos-HRrqB9Yx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3529"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e006d4b6-738e-3d80-817b-24bf7bf3320c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "129dc460-82ea-3317-be3f-f9f1968a243c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
