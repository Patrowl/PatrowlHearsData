The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface on an affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:16:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:11:49", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-mlt-xss-zUzbcdEV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3466"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "18cefa4e-ceb4-3519-9ba8-84d14a752a9b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80b5ab00-7c5b-3175-9f66-491234dcb493", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
