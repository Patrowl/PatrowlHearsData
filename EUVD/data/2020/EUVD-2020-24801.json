The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to incorrect mapping in the source code of task group assignments for a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the command, which they should not be authorized to issue, on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to invalidate the integrity of the disk and cause the device to restart. This vulnerability could allow a user with read permissions to issue a specific command that should require Administrator privileges.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:25:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:08:33", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxr-cli-privescl-sDVEmhqv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3530"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9b0b73d0-86db-37b2-b5cd-069043a0c20f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d1425b2f-4055-3e63-bbb6-7d37f0349e3a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
