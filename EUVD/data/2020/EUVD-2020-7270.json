Since Veyon users (both students and teachers) usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all potentially untrustworthy users.", "datePublished": "2020-10-19T21:30:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:15:19", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-15261", "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-x786-hqqp", "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/issues/657", "https://github.com/veyon/veyon/commit/f231ec511b9a09f43f49b2c7bb7c60b8046276b1", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162873/Veyon-4.4.1-Unquoted-Service-Path.html", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49925", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48246"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15261"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 8.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10fa30f0-9f6a-3d66-9f53-1203656216cd", "product": {"name": "veyon"}, "product_version": "< 0.11.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "60d5591f-cf2c-3f74-9b23-95f63a9d4139", "vendor": {"name": "veyon"}}], "isExploited": false}
