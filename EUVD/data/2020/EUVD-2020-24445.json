The ARP entries are for nonlocal IP addresses for the subnet. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a received gratuitous ARP (GARP) request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious GARP packet on the local subnet to cause the ARP table on the device to become corrupted. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to populate the ARP table with incorrect entries, which could lead to traffic disruptions.", "datePublished": "2020-02-26T16:50:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:38:37", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-nxos-arp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3174"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ef06e88e-21ef-3b85-ab12-f67b26f162a6", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software 7.3(2)D1(1d)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "218b43b6-a0ba-3497-a87b-b97fb559dd81", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
