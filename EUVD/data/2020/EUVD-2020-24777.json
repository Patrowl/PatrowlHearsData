{"id": "EUVD-2020-24777", "enisaUuid": "dbce99fc-fd20-3419-a804-7a7d0d2b9644", "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP camera. These vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP cameras process a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP camera or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:15:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:12:55", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipcameras-rce-dos-uPyJYxN3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3506"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6d7e7255-4b42-31d5-97d0-cb6087e9d94b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a5fe1a8-0e76-3476-b8d5-0f110e935453", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
