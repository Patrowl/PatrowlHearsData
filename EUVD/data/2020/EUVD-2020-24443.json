{"id": "EUVD-2020-24443", "enisaUuid": "fb7a98de-e832-3330-ac51-e061485e5d1a", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol feature of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code as root or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because of insufficiently validated Cisco Discovery Protocol packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to a Layer 2-adjacent affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as root or cause a DoS condition on the affected device. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). Note: This vulnerability is different from the following Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol vulnerabilities that Cisco announced on Feb. 5, 2020: Cisco FXOS, IOS XR, and NX-OS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-02-26T16:50:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:38:15", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-fxos-nxos-cdp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3172"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.65, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a34c424d-2dc4-368f-8f37-ecd91b2e50d2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "66fa010a-339d-3e75-845f-8f8325653b0a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
