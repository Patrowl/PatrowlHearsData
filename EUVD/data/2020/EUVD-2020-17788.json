Users within LogRhythm can be delegated different roles and privileges, intended to limit what data and services they can interact with. However, no access control is enforced for WebSocket-based communication to the PM application server, which will forward requests to any configured back-end server, regardless of whether the user's access rights should permit this. As a result, even the most low-privileged user can interact with any back-end component that has a LogRhythm agent installed.", "datePublished": "2020-12-17T02:03:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:26:09", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://cybercx.com.au/blog/2020/12/15/logrhythm-zero-days/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-25096"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1abeedcd-82aa-3a0a-a1ec-c8804d219695", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "65dd83a9-062d-3bb3-90cf-366648f9c57a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
