The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:15:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:13:14", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-xss-JnHSWG5C"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3518"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "24cb098d-6ca3-334a-8950-644c21da6064", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bc1995f8-3503-3b66-8f0a-a1973e4f8ec1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
