{"id": "EUVD-2020-0236", "enisaUuid": "5ab83ebf-9338-30f5-aea8-18aa88ddb99e", "description": "In Wagtail before versions 2.7.2 and 2.8.2, a potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's \\\"Privacy\\\" controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. This is understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet. Privacy settings that restrict access to pages/documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this vulnerability. This has been patched in 2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9.", "datePublished": "2020-04-30T23:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-05-08T15:57:00", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11037", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/3c030490ed575bb9cd01dfb3a890477dcaeb2edf", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/b76ab57ee859732b9cf9287d380493ab24061090", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/ba9d424bd1ca5ce1910d3de74f5cc07214fbfb11", "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/commit/bac3cd0a26b023e595cf2959aae7da15bb5e4340", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/wagtail/PYSEC-2020-153.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11037", "GHSA-jjjr-3jcw-f8v6", "PYSEC-2020-153"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3666d636-f3f1-3793-ade7-f11ee2f2e02e", "product": {"name": "wagtail"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.3"}, {"id": "52257821-4463-3507-90c2-a8d5a4723e7e", "product": {"name": "wagtail"}, "product_version": "= 2.9rc1"}, {"id": "e307dd25-3c8c-3723-a33c-1d1adcac7c38", "product": {"name": "wagtail"}, "product_version": "2.8rc1, < 2.8.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0134a564-75b0-3d7d-98ac-9d9865604a22", "vendor": {"name": "wagtail"}}], "isExploited": false}
