In Jupyter Server before version 1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may *appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix: \\\"jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/\\\".", "datePublished": "2020-12-21T18:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-03-30T19:15:00", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-9f66-54xg-pc2c", "https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-server/", "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/85e4abccf6ea9321d29153f73b0bd72ccb3a6bca", "https://advisory.checkmarx.net/advisory/CX-2020-4291", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26275", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/jupyter-server/PYSEC-2020-50.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26275", "GHSA-9f66-54xg-pc2c", "PYSEC-2020-50"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d2429478-5502-3f88-8331-f1c310c42831", "product": {"name": "jupyter_server"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01265049-e38e-3a80-afb6-f919fd069adb", "vendor": {"name": "jupyter-server"}}], "isExploited": false}
