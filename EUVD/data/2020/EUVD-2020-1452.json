In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before version 1.0.469, an authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.", "datePublished": "2020-11-23T19:35:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:23", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/octobercms/october/security/advisories/GHSA-94vp-rmqv-5875", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15247", "https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/4c650bb775ab849e48202a4923bac93bd74f9982", "https://github.com/octobercms/october"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15247", "GHSA-94vp-rmqv-5875"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0f700435-4745-3100-ae9d-2e2c27d6700f", "product": {"name": "October"}, "product_version": "1.0.319, < 1.0.469"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "974bf202-ee21-3692-a22a-ad2bdb5bc505", "vendor": {"name": "octobercms"}}], "isExploited": false}
