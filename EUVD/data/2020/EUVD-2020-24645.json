The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured user authorization level. The attacker may be able to access sensitive information, modify the system configuration, or impact the availability of the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-07-31T00:01:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:17:05", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uabvman-SYGzt8Bv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3374"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b9183cda-b67d-3313-901a-444845faa5dd", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2c0289b7-48eb-3be6-83f7-06a53bcfad05", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
