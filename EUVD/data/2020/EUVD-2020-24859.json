This vulnerability occurs when this app is deployed in a virtual desktop environment and using virtual environment optimization. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of messages processed by the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App. A local attacker with limited privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious messages to the affected software by using the virtualization channel interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the underlying operating system configuration, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only when Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App is in a virtual desktop environment on a hosted virtual desktop (HVD) and is configured to use the Cisco Webex Meetings virtual desktop plug-in for thin clients.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:16:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:42:34", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-vdi-qQrpBwuJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3588"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "716f81d9-c726-3b14-9439-c8faf0da4534", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7295c757-81fa-34e3-b731-5a0c4152237b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
