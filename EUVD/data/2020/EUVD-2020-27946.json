This required Firefox to be configured as the default handler for a given file type and for a file downloaded to be opened in a third party application that insufficiently sanitized URL data. In that situation, clicking a link in the third party application could have been used to retrieve and execute files whose location was supplied through command line arguments. Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems and when Firefox is configured as the default handler for non-default filetypes. Other operating systems are unaffected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 73 and Firefox < ESR68.5.", "datePublished": "2020-03-02T04:05:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T09:11:05", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-6799.html", "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-05/", "https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2020-06/", "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1606596", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-02"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6799"], "assigner": "mozilla", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "411403dd-d5c3-306d-98e0-4ed460906f08", "product": {"name": "Firefox"}, "product_version": "unspecified <ESR68.5"}, {"id": "628b495c-acf1-323d-8911-813d2dcced67", "product": {"name": "Firefox"}, "product_version": "unspecified <73"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa461580-655f-3371-a6f1-78079871c0d6", "vendor": {"name": "Mozilla"}}], "isExploited": false}
