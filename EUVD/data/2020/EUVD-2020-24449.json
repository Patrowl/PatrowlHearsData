The vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by intercepting an HTTP request and modifying it to redirect a user to a specific malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page or to obtain sensitive browser-based information. This type of attack is commonly referred to as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks to get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:35:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:28:01", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-opn-rdrct-yPPMdsMQ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3178"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6ddc78aa-5371-3221-91a1-bda2aa801da9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "456960b7-b571-3a5b-80c9-60d28438db7c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
