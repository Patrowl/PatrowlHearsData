The vulnerability is due to improper validation of fields in Cisco SD-WAN peering messages that are encapsulated in UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP messages to the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause services on the device to fail, resulting in a DoS condition that could impact the targeted device and other devices that depend on it.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:21:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:54:26", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-dos-KWOdyHnB"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3351"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e8593a97-63f9-3c9f-9e9e-e61bc01d8947", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f17dbdcd-b75a-313d-8af4-6f209ebc0ac4", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
