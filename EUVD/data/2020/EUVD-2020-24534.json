The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is supplied to application URLs. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute other programs that are already present on the end-user system. If malicious files are planted on the system or on an accessible network file path, the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:21:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:59:07", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-client-url-fcmpdfVY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3263"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.76, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "71c9b303-50de-3204-8c34-d42b2566278a", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bacce653-97b3-3071-9dd8-f6305a4690be", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
