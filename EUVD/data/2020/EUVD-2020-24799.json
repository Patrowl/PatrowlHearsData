The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation when the affected software processes certain OSPFv2 packets with Link-Local Signaling (LLS) data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed OSPFv2 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:35:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:50:05", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ospflls-37Xy2q6r"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3528"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2e7aed07-563a-3dd0-9324-6dae79ce1b2c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5aeff405-404d-381c-9065-fd4b00972062", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
