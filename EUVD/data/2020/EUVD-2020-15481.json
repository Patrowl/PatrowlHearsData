An attacker can obtain admin privileges by placing a malicious .exe file in the application and renaming it ScadaAgentSvc.exe, which would result in executing the binary as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM in a Windows operating system. For example, an attacker can plant a reverse shell from a low privileged user account and by restarting the computer, the malicious service will be started as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by giving the attacker full system access to the remote PC.", "datePublished": "2020-08-14T15:44:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T14:51:10", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://syhack.wordpress.com/2020/04/21/rapid-scada-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-22722"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9d03f99-264a-3371-a842-41be8c8c2a48", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "969d9d3b-bcb3-385b-9b1d-7344bf3b5ffc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
