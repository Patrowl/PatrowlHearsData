The vulnerability is due to a watchdog timeout and crash during the cleanup of threads that are associated with a SIP connection that is being deleted from the connection list. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted SIP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a watchdog timeout and crash, resulting in a crash and reload of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:41:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:45:33", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-sipdos-3DGvdjvg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3555"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "21bdcd2a-f42b-3816-9bab-3cb03c231c8a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7f3f6244-5229-3263-864a-aa3f01905629", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
