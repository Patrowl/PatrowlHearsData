The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data passed to the Tcl interpreter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading malicious Tcl code on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory corruption or execute the code with root privileges on the underlying OS of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:40:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:19:26", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-tcl-ace-C9KuVKmm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3204"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "78dce303-0575-36d8-833f-961af3262a20", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 12.2(53)SE1"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "827b40b9-9f87-3894-bcf8-a9e3bdc36799", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
