The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of TCP packets to a specific port on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the device to reload unexpectedly. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after it has reloaded.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:41:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:46:20", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-tcp-dos-GDcZDqAf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3563"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fbf27a87-97c9-3c7d-b89d-0bd7109067c5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c42c41e4-66e7-3711-a8d1-ac1b893e40f5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
