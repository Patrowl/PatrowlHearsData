NOTE: unlike most CVEs, exploitability depends on the product version that was in use when a particular setup step was performed, NOT the product version that is in use during a current assessment of a CVE consumer's product inventory. Specifically, the vulnerability can be exploited if a storage zone was created by one of these product versions: 5.9.0, 5.8.0, 5.7.0, 5.6.0, 5.5.0, or earlier. This CVE differs from CVE-2020-8982 and CVE-2020-8983 but has essentially the same risk.", "datePublished": "2020-05-07T13:54:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T09:33:19", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX269106"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-7473"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 67.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "57454006-276d-3ca1-a15b-0807a45b5d08", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3a33f45b-b0eb-38ae-b739-52d05f3c83e8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
