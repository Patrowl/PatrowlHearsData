While searching for an object identifier in a malformed document that is missing from the cross-reference table, the application will save a reference to the object\u2019s cross-reference table entry inside a stack variable. If the referenced object identifier is not found, the application may resize the cross-reference table which can change the scope of its entry. Later when the application tries to reference cross-reference entry via the stack variable, the application will access memory belonging to the recently freed table causing a use-after-free condition. A specially crafted document can be delivered by an attacker and loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T12:19:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:47:41", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1068"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6115"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5fd101be-11c5-3ae7-be7c-c9de40956642", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
