OpenPGP has three passwords: Admin PIN, Reset Code, and User PIN. The Reset Code is used to reset the User PIN, but it is disabled by default. A flaw in the implementation of OpenPGP sets the Reset Code to a known value upon initialization. If the retry counter for the Reset Code is set to non-zero without changing the Reset Code, this known value can be used to reset the User PIN. To set the retry counters, the Admin PIN is required.", "datePublished": "2020-07-09T17:57:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:00:52", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2020-05/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15000"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6df79c7b-72c2-39e2-a674-cef379abaed9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f8f59d4-a73c-34a9-b162-05e2ebb5e7dc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
