The attacker must have a valid CAC to initiate the access attempt. The vulnerability is due to incorrect session invalidation during CAC authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a CAC-based authentication attempt to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access an affected system with the privileges of a CAC-authenticated user who is currently logged in.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:36:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:48:29", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-cacauthbyp-NCLGZm3Q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3410"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "564bacf3-7b55-35cf-afed-ae54b1d099fa", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f6b3f8e3-cb58-3daf-af95-7cdd8ee7b3a5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
