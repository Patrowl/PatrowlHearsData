Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in Opencast 7.9 and Opencast 8.8 Please be aware that fixing the problem means that Opencast will not simply accept any self-signed certificates any longer without properly importing them. If you need those, please make sure to import them into the Java key store. Better yet, get a valid certificate.", "datePublished": "2020-12-08T22:35:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:02", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories/GHSA-44cw-p2hm-gpf6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26234", "https://github.com/opencast/opencast/commit/4225bf90af74557deaf8fb6b80b0705c9621acfc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26234", "GHSA-44cw-p2hm-gpf6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b290b468-c9bb-3347-b155-4c3941178e04", "product": {"name": "opencast"}, "product_version": "8.0, < 8.9"}, {"id": "e7bdaffb-6c62-31a3-b14a-a76f3ad142ac", "product": {"name": "opencast"}, "product_version": "< 7.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9e5208b-1eae-3be5-853c-30d8eeae63d7", "vendor": {"name": "opencast"}}], "isExploited": false}
