The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web UI. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information on an affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T17:40:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:38:54", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-FND-XSS-NzOPCGEc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26081"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "21f600f4-d763-33ae-8474-4489f9a74e19", "product": {"name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "442618d5-3808-3666-8aa4-c878d3300b33", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
