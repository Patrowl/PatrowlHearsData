To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials for the affected device. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the enable command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and issuing the enable command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full administrative privileges without using the enable password. Note: The Enable Secret feature is disabled by default.", "datePublished": "2020-08-27T15:40:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:09:48", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n3n9k-priv-escal-3QhXJBC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3394"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ba01c29d-00a7-386d-909a-0a33404d43c7", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0e9ce046-3ae8-385b-acd2-cf9b60f58758", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
