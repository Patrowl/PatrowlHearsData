An adversary can exploit this to cause the driver to misinterpret part of the payload of a large packet as a separate packet, and thereby inject packets across security boundaries such as VLANs.", "datePublished": "2021-03-26T20:55:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T09:33:18", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-20:27.ure.asc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-7464"], "assigner": "freebsd", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db407226-7591-3100-9914-b9ace236de9b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
