The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection mechanisms for the TURN server credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the legitimate traffic that is generated by an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the TURN server credentials, which the attacker could use to place audio/video calls and forward packets through the configured TURN server. The attacker would not be able to take control of the TURN server unless the same credentials were used in multiple systems.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:20:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:55:51", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cma-turn-crdls-RHjSzKXn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3197"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b89be4f8-4e60-3dd6-b0a6-4be986414c13", "product": {"name": "Cisco Meeting App"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fb109108-8dc5-3e81-b8f5-1f07995ce1ed", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
