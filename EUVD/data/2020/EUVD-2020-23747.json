Processes using OpenSSL attempt to load and execute libraries from paths that do not exist by default on the Windows operating system. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories under the top level of any drive. If a low privileged user creates an affected path with a library that the Veritas product attempts to load, they can execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM or Administrator. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed applications, etc. This vulnerability affects master servers, media servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers on the Windows platform. The system is vulnerable during an install or upgrade and post-install during normal operations.", "datePublished": "2021-01-06T00:50:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:23:09", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:L/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:C/UI:N", "references": ["https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-016#Issue1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-36169"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4d9b164-7a78-323b-b415-56fd2c9fe288", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eea3895e-9467-3d67-be5d-841f6449b9cc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
