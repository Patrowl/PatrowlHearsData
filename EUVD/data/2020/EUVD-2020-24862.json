The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:17:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:42:16", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanxsshi-9KHEqRpM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3591"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "414a221c-8c51-38fe-a13c-824c3133b6e7", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ce51fc2-a654-3022-99a4-e9620e82c5f7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
