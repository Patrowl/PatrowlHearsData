The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:15:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:12:26", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cvdsd-xss-teMmLyUr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3491"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f52bcf85-e1ee-31e9-9b10-456f8ead611e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9b46d8b2-8a6a-34cf-8e8d-d04e19649a34", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
