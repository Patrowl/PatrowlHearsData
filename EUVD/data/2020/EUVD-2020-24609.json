{"id": "EUVD-2020-24609", "enisaUuid": "138ba372-6da2-3da0-bcf1-dd800203b44f", "description": "A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature for IPv6 networks (PIM6) of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when processing inbound PIM6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted PIM6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PIM6 application to leak system memory. Over time, this memory leak could cause the PIM6 application to stop processing legitimate PIM6 traffic, leading to a DoS condition on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-08-27T15:40:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:09:39", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-pim-memleak-dos-tC8eP7uw"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3338"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ed808915-df5b-3c22-aaba-fc91ddb28cd7", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software 5.2(1)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75582549-b8f6-3abe-ae5f-6e5d79d0d45a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
