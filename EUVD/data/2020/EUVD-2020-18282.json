{"id": "EUVD-2020-18282", "enisaUuid": "0bfffebd-bf2e-38a1-a422-03bdb6faa9ff", "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Event channels control structures can be accessed lockless as long as the port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an appropriate memory barrier (e.g., smp_*mb()) to prevent both the compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A malicious guest may be able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded. Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a system is vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For all systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen. We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code generation options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-ordering is possible. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU is able to re-order memory access. Please consult your CPU vendor. x86 systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T21:34:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:33:05", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25603.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4769", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-25603.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25603", "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-340.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4JRXMKEMQRQYWYEPHVBIWUEAVQ3LU4FN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DA633Y3G5KX7MKRN4PFEGM3IVTJMBEOM/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00008.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RJZERRBJN6E6STDCHT4JHP4MI6TKBCJE/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202011-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-25603"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a74e40b1-7c1c-3674-b5dc-8b891085f007", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d96c55fe-8b9a-3405-acf2-117ad8f2afd6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
