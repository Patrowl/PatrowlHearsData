The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Webex player application to crash when trying to view the malicious file. This vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player releases earlier than Release 3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2 and 4.0 MR3.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T16:55:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:20:29", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvs98254"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3319"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "04d37f52-76fc-3f08-88e2-ba2a30153088", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2"}, {"id": "7d5659fe-e634-3c50-a6a1-19642b34ec11", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0 MR3"}, {"id": "9ac0a019-560e-3e2c-b361-c9a22027b08b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0 MR3"}, {"id": "f8a5d117-aadb-34c0-bf4c-94d5c46aa5f6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "018a401a-8901-3685-8bf0-71e80790026c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
