The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing the address of an existing Access Point on the network and sending a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet that includes a crafted Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process crash that would lead to a reload of the device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:52:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:59:11", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-wlc-fnfv9-EvrAQpNX"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3492"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12f1cfaf-97b4-3684-8f7f-fe19dbbc390c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d75d0abb-fe3c-3994-a323-ee1b0bef2107", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
