The vulnerability is due to a missing check when the affected software processes Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, causing the device to reload. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T17:50:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:42:14", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-fxnxos-iosxr-cdp-dos", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156203/Cisco-Discovery-Protocol-CDP-Remote-Device-Takeover.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3120"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b60a63f4-e607-3a31-9242-e5c149ef4c2f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.3.1.173"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "98e49259-9e69-3d2a-8549-2454df3526ee", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
