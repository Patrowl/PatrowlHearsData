The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation when Ethernet frames are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious Ethernet frames through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker do either of the following: Fill the /ngfw partition on the device: A full /ngfw partition could result in administrators being unable to log in to the device (including logging in through the console port) or the device being unable to boot up correctly. Note: Manual intervention is required to recover from this situation. Customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a device in this condition. Cause a process crash: The process crash would cause the device to reload. No manual intervention is necessary to recover the device after the reload.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:40:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:47:10", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-inline-dos-nXqUyEqM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3577"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c847c7d9-d090-35e4-984f-f533abc9d623", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86064a5a-f5ad-3a08-8692-2d7539cfc03d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
