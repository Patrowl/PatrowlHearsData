A complete lack of validation of attacker-controlled parameters can lead to a buffer over read. The results of the over read are then written back to the guest virtual machine memory. This vulnerability can be used by an attacker in a virtual machine to read significant amounts of host memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and system availability.", "datePublished": "2020-09-30T18:53:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:46:33", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14377.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-14377", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/09/28/3", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1879472", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4550-1/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00004.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00006.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-14377"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e93a4ea-e3c9-36bb-ac9a-ec790276a029", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
