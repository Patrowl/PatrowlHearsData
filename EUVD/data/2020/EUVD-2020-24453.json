The vulnerability exists because sensitive information is included in the mDNS reply. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing an mDNS query for a particular service against an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:35:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:36:41", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-info-disc-OHqg982"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3182"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ada5ce9-f25a-31ed-b2d7-e34fedd78599", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "97a8c925-1583-335b-a9bc-16891c124525", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
