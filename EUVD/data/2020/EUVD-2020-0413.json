A user with permission to create comments could POST HTML directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then be executed/displayed to others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability custom JavaScript code could be injected and therefore ran on other user machines. This most impacts scenarios where not-trusted users are given permission to create comments. This has been fixed in 0.29.2.", "datePublished": "2020-05-07T20:40:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:21:14", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-5vf7-q87h-pg6w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11055", "https://bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-29-2", "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.29.2", "http://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN41035278/index.html", "https://bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-29-2/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11055", "GHSA-5vf7-q87h-pg6w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61dfa479-8835-395b-8a9d-b7910758ba28", "product": {"name": "BookStack"}, "product_version": "0.18.0, < 0.29.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c5136212-a5a3-32d9-8deb-c79f427c2865", "vendor": {"name": "BookStackApp"}}], "isExploited": false}
