The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative credentials on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-08-17T18:00:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:15:57", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucs-director-xss-O7T8ORYR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3464"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d94f134c-9b8e-388e-8ce2-2a05a9f9ab6f", "product": {"name": "Cisco UCS Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "766b0a69-a726-3c80-b208-1472b9383d7c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
