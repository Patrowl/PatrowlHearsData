As a result, users are exposed to basic double spending attacks, amplified double spending attacks, and DoS attacks without user consent.", "datePublished": "2020-07-02T14:42:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:48:58", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://donjon.ledger.com/lsb/012/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-12119"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d57f6663-e39c-3412-97f4-540a04d4af59", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4b26d5b-6b18-338c-bd6c-a77432c7428f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
