{"id": "EUVD-2020-21849", "enisaUuid": "5fb10da3-2b14-3ee2-bf97-53060f679041", "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of Xenstore nodes are per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access rights are not removed when a domain is being destroyed. This means that a new domain created with the same domid will inherit the access rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous domain(s) with the same domid. Because all Xenstore entries of a guest below /local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xen tools when a guest is destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guests still running are affected. For example, a newly created guest domain might be able to read sensitive information that had belonged to a previously existing guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are vulnerable.", "datePublished": "2020-12-15T17:51:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:55:09", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-29481.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4812", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-29481.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-322.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/16/3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OBLV6L6Q24PPQ2CRFXDX4Q76KU776GKI/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2C6M6S3CIMEBACH6O7V4H2VDANMO6TVA/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-29481"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "adde9c1e-6cfb-3316-a2c9-92c90ce6e7a5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9e272b03-9f05-37ce-a710-5a4ac1901e90", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
