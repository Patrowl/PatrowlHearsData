{"id": "EUVD-2020-24815", "enisaUuid": "7fd39f72-882e-3ba7-9a4c-957835a60ce4", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to reload. This vulnerability is due to missing checks when an IP camera processes a Cisco Discovery Protocol packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP camera or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Note: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2020-10-08T04:20:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:52:50", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cdp-rcedos-mAHR8vNx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3544"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a288b1f4-d1ae-3169-bf7d-efbe088910c8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c260aa45-51be-36d1-8148-0067a6d03532", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
