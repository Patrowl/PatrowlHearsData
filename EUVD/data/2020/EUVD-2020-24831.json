The vulnerability is due to improper resource management while processing specific packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted UDP packets to a specific port on an affected device. A successful exploit could either allow the attacker to tear down the connection between the AP and the wireless LAN controller, resulting in the affected device not being able to process client traffic, or cause the vulnerable device to reload, triggering a DoS condition. After the attack, the affected device should automatically recover its normal functions without manual intervention.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:50:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:02:03", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aironet-dos-VHr2zG9y"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3560"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ff9450cc-f316-3eaa-a381-4b43746f7104", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac7518ec-5e38-35db-8e22-e9887870050d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
