The vulnerability exists because the web management software does not properly handle RBAC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and delete certain screen content on the system that the attacker would not normally have privileges to access.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:16:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:12:17", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cvdsd-rbac-y9LM5jw4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3485"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b8e802b-1a5a-3119-bef0-c0a636ffda71", "product": {"name": "Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e1f7109f-67a5-3305-ba88-f9fdf2806272", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
