When drawing the contents of a page and selecting the stroke color from an 'ICCBased' colorspace, the application will read a length from the file and use it as a loop sentinel when writing data into the member of an object. Due to the object member being a buffer of a static size allocated on the heap, this can result in a heap-based buffer overflow. A specially crafted document must be loaded by a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-09-16T18:48:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:55:21", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1084"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6146"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4358aa27-7cd2-3e40-851f-af2e3c77d225", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
