The vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-08-17T18:01:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:14:10", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-selfcare-drASc7sr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3346"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "75e0ba33-45c5-368e-91a7-6a4b2151c882", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c5d1c7af-6386-3c78-b3e6-9382c521f42f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
