The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when parsing DNS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious DNS requests to an Umbrella Connector client interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the iosd process, which triggers a reload of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:51:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:00:31", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-umbrella-dos-t2QMUX37"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3510"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.75, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d746389d-a75b-38d6-8690-5c9514ebb6ce", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7965fce6-17c8-3843-94d5-0e768ce9db6a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
