This vulnerability is due to incorrect validations by boot scripts when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables are set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing code to a specific directory in the underlying operating system (OS) and setting a specific ROMMON variable. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying OS. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need access to the root shell on the device or have physical access to the device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:01:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:55:57", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xbace-OnCEbyS"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3417"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "213a83ec-d03c-340f-b875-c8dd9e042798", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "847a0d65-3bae-3fe1-b5d5-bed0315e75c7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
