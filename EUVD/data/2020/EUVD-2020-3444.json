The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-09T15:45:50", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11080.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4696", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3084", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3042", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2895", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2852", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2850", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2849", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2848", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2847", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2823", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2784", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2755", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2646", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2644", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2524", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2523", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-11080.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2020-11080.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11080.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-06/msg00024.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AAC2AA36OTRHKSVM5OV7TTVB3CZIGEFL/", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/security/advisories/GHSA-q5wr-xfw9-q7xr", "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/336a98feb0d56b9ac54e12736b18785c27f75090", "https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/commit/f8da73bd042f810f34d19f9eae02b46d870af394", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4OOYAMJVLLCLXDTHW3V5UXNULZBBK4O6/", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00011.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00023.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11080"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ef15d8f3-1348-3356-ae1f-066d4d0e845b", "product": {"name": "nghttp2"}, "product_version": "< 1.41.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ff07c45-b79b-3136-8dea-ea57958b32f9", "vendor": {"name": "nghttp2"}}], "isExploited": false}
