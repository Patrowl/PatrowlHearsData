As a part of EJBCA's domain security model, the peer connector allows the restriction of client certificates (for the RA, not the end user) to a limited set of allowed CAs, thus restricting the accessibility of that RA to the rights it has within a specific role. While this works for other protocols such as CMP, it was found that the EJBCA enrollment over an EST implementation bypasses this check, allowing enrollment with a valid client certificate through any functioning and authenticated RA connected to the CA. NOTE: an attacker must already have a trusted client certificate and authorization to enroll against the targeted CA.", "datePublished": "2020-11-19T16:38:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:47:59", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://support.primekey.com/news/posts/40"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-28942"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "072bc230-32a3-3b99-b9ee-1578efdfba52", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e8b1671-8267-3d2a-888b-e11ba3d772e0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
