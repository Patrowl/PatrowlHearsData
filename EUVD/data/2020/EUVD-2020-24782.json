The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when the ISDN Q.931 messages are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious ISDN Q.931 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the process to crash, resulting in a reload of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:51:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:00:40", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-isdn-q931-dos-67eUZBTf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3511"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "106957a6-1a23-37f1-97e5-e3953e66a824", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4b87734f-3f2d-3c46-9e20-4a1ae3cd770d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
