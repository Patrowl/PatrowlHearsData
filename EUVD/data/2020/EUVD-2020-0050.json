Due to the non-committing property of AES-GCM (and other AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM-SIV or (X)ChaCha20Poly1305) used by the SDKs to encrypt messages, an attacker can craft a unique cyphertext which will decrypt to multiple different results, and becomes especially relevant in a multi-recipient setting. We recommend users update their SDK to 2.0.0 or later.", "datePublished": "2020-11-16T12:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-09-26T23:32:16", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/improved-client-side-encryption-explicit-keyids-and-key-commitment/", "https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-wqgp-vphw-hphf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8897", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/aws-encryption-sdk/PYSEC-2020-261.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-8897", "GHSA-wqgp-vphw-hphf", "PYSEC-2020-261"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ff29790d-9372-3bab-84c3-e5b569375ebf", "product": {"name": "AWS SDK"}, "product_version": "stable <2.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d131cdbf-53b3-30dc-ba14-c887ddb1e095", "vendor": {"name": "Amazon"}}], "isExploited": false}
