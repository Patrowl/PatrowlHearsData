{"id": "EUVD-2020-24381", "enisaUuid": "292d0fbf-e24f-3ace-93b0-2253cf23c4e8", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP Camera. The vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP Camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to expose the affected IP Camera for remote code execution or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). This vulnerability is fixed in Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Camera Firmware Release 1.0.7 and later.", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T17:35:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:42:54", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-ipcameras-rce-dos", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156203/Cisco-Discovery-Protocol-CDP-Remote-Device-Takeover.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3110"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "721e4765-39c2-3a08-9df2-8bbf8d3a76ea", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3b224535-b9c0-31c7-b31f-e53eb64416e9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
