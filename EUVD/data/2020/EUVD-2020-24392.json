The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link and access a specific page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:31:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:45:38", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-sbsms-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3121"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b7876740-8b4f-342f-bb7e-e475f2089fcc", "product": {"name": "Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "42e256a1-cd42-3a16-8ea9-6072d043e9aa", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
