MAVLink is a header-based protocol that does not perform encryption to improve transfer (and reception speed) and efficiency by design. The increasing popularity of the protocol (used accross different autopilots) has led to its use in wired and wireless mediums through insecure communication channels exposing sensitive information to a remote attacker with ability to intercept network traffic.", "datePublished": "2020-07-03T14:30:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T20:37:09", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtbD0ORNkhZ8eKrsbSIZNLyg9sFRXMXbsR2mp37KbIg/edit"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10281"], "assigner": "Alias", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e6e52a03-fa25-3ead-bcea-9f5cfb3fbae0", "product": {"name": "MAVLink"}, "product_version": "v2.0 and before"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "45240efa-e866-3a4d-ac82-67ad6ce27c48", "vendor": {"name": "unspecified"}}], "isExploited": false}
