The vulnerability is due to the presence of weak, hard-coded credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and then connecting to VDS through the device&rsquo;s virtual console by using the static credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the Linux shell of VDS as the root user.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:55:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:11:57", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cred-uPMp9zbY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3234"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a133b2ca-9fd1-3494-8107-c07bc7f338c4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 12.2(60)EZ16"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8a22235-3a1e-3209-bca6-6e88ae61edf9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
