The vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to API requests that are a part of meeting join flow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an API request to the application, which would return a URL that includes a meeting join page that is prepopulated with the meeting username and password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to join the password-protected meeting. The attacker would be visible in the attendee list of the meeting.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:25:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:09:02", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-meetings-UtbwOR4Q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3542"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7f158107-b51d-3b2f-9299-a19ea0de6a17", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3c05d72d-b09e-393a-a8af-cc18ae0c083b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
