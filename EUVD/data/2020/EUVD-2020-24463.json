The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:35:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:36:07", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-prime-collab-xss-RjRCe9n7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3192"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "626904e0-ccc7-3639-b634-515a545c5a34", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac9814f6-bd67-33e1-a7bf-e17556dea801", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
