These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:35:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:49:53", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-6VqH4rpZ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3515"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "088f755a-b72e-3ef1-b90a-db2b13ee8d74", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c728f96a-ba93-3b43-820a-3902e4672943", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
