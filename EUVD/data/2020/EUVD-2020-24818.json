The vulnerability exists because an insecure method is used to mask certain passwords on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by looking at the raw HTML code that is received from the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain some of the passwords configured throughout the interface.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:26:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:07:07", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-wsa-esa-info-dis-vsvPzOHP"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3547"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b6477e10-7445-3bac-9970-1baea65bb9e0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "40754700-832e-39bf-a1ea-10704e816001", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
