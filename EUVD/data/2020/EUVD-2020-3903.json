This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to escalate privileges on a Windows host. An attacker does not require any privilege on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. One option is the self-service option on the Windows login screen. Upon selecting this option, the thick-client software is launched, which connects to a remote ADSelfService Plus server to facilitate self-service operations. An unauthenticated attacker having physical access to the host could trigger a security alert by supplying a self-signed SSL certificate to the client. The View Certificate option from the security alert allows an attacker to export a displayed certificate to a file. This can further cascade to a dialog that can open Explorer as SYSTEM. By navigating from Explorer to \\windows\\system32, cmd.exe can be launched as a SYSTEM.", "datePublished": "2020-08-11T15:43:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:35:13", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-11552", "https://www.manageengine.com", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/4", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158820/ManageEngine-ADSelfService-Plus-6000-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "https://pitstop.manageengine.com/portal/en/community/topic/adselfservice-plus-6003-release-faceid-support", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48739", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Aug/6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11552"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7e85483b-f0d8-3609-b792-a4cfd9afecae", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2e919d97-18a2-3f19-8b77-9f10cf456441", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
