The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch management CLI to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:15:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:12:35", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbss-ipv6-dos-tsgqbffW"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3496"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ba611dc-ff75-36bb-803f-b2988bcad574", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 250 Series Smart Switches Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8681a354-95ed-334b-90e2-276856552f74", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
