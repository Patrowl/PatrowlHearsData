The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read files on the underlying operating system with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T16:16:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:12:08", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cvdsd-pathtrv-5tLJRrFn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3490"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9ade6fed-7c9c-363f-9bfd-d32fa84dcdda", "product": {"name": "Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "48832055-3b54-3f65-960d-e09770857867", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
