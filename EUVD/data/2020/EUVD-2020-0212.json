Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-09-01T08:19:35", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/42143/commits/3ade2efec2e90c6237de32a19680caaa3ebc2845", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42129", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-xwhf-g6j5-j5gc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15266", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2020-296.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2020-331.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2020-139.yaml", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-15266"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15266", "GHSA-xwhf-g6j5-j5gc", "PYSEC-2020-296"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "881991f7-5766-31ce-a4a0-46e36b782381", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fc252ae6-c742-32c8-bc67-d41978d9e52c", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
