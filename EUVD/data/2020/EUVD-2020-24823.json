The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wired client to the Ethernet interface of an affected device and sending a series of specific packets within a short time frame. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer access that results in a reload of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:51:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:01:45", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ap-ethport-dos-xtjTt8pY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3552"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b92b9c39-ef6b-375c-841e-eb5b6fa65d4f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87253f4a-b933-3e60-8de8-05cb97a2fd75", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
