Dell is aware of unauthorized password generation tools that can generate BIOS recovery passwords. The tools, which are not authorized by Dell, can be used by a physically present attacker to reset BIOS passwords and BIOS-managed Hard Disk Drive (HDD) passwords. An unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the system could potentially exploit this vulnerability to bypass security restrictions for BIOS Setup configuration, HDD access and BIOS pre-boot authentication.", "datePublished": "2021-01-04T21:15:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T23:06:25", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000180741/dsa-2020-119-dell-client-products-unauthorized-bios-password-reset-tool-vulnerability"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5361"], "assigner": "dell", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "56adc5f7-2a24-3930-b5b3-eaf9d3c502fb", "product": {"name": "CPG BIOS"}, "product_version": "unspecified <All"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23e7feaf-3a27-317e-b85a-226852fa0fd1", "vendor": {"name": "Dell"}}], "isExploited": false}
