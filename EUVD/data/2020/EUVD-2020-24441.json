The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the Cisco NX-OS device itself would still be available and passing network traffic. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.", "datePublished": "2020-02-26T16:50:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:37:52", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-nxos-api-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3170"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b3401f93-df3b-3ab4-bacf-94cc2c96099c", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software 7.3(2)D1(1d)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cc94deea-3b50-3347-b6a5-ecb0df22923d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
