The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient protections of the secure boot process. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting code into specific files that are then referenced during the device boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break the chain of trust and inject code into the boot process of the device, which would be executed at each boot and maintain persistence across reboots.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:36:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:49:16", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxos-sbbyp-KqP6NgrE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3458"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ac51f94b-a0b3-3e58-8732-bfd088a63177", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ccc2c45f-f4b4-3a4c-a4f7-60c1ebe8f35f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
