It employs caching of std::shared_ptr values, using the raw pointer address as a unique identifier. This becomes problematic if an std::shared_ptr variable goes out of scope and is freed, and a new std::shared_ptr is allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes dependent upon memory layout. In short, serialized std::shared_ptr variables cannot always be expected to serialize back into their original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending on the context within which this manifests.", "datePublished": "2020-03-30T21:30:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:21:14", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11105.html", "https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues/636"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11105"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bcf4fac1-fe16-3a50-aa41-1846dc9e8fda", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "462e2d7f-5221-3705-aead-cc5a4ea4e1e6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
