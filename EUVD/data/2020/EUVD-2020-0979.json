{"id": "EUVD-2020-0979", "enisaUuid": "babc8ebf-34e8-3bd8-b7ec-73a44fcea4a8", "description": "In Action View before versions 5.2.4.4 and 6.0.3.3 there is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Action View's translation helpers. Views that allow the user to control the default (not found) value of the `t` and `translate` helpers could be susceptible to XSS attacks. When an HTML-unsafe string is passed as the default for a missing translation key named html or ending in _html, the default string is incorrectly marked as HTML-safe and not escaped. This is patched in versions 6.0.3.3 and 5.2.4.4. A workaround without upgrading is proposed in the source advisory.", "datePublished": "2020-09-11T15:50:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-cfjv-5498-mph5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15169", "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e663f084460ea56c55c3dc76f78c7caeddeeb02e", "https://github.com/rails/rails", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/actionview/CVE-2020-15169.yml", "https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/b-C9kSGXYrc", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/10/msg00015.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XJ7NUWXAEVRQCROIIBV4C6WXO6IR3KSB", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4766", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15169.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1313", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XJ7NUWXAEVRQCROIIBV4C6WXO6IR3KSB/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15169", "GHSA-cfjv-5498-mph5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "137d914d-e6e1-3c25-a867-b95238c0172c", "product": {"name": "actionview"}, "product_version": "6.0.0.0, < 6.0.3.3"}, {"id": "990399fd-cca6-362a-81ce-a59db3beef96", "product": {"name": "actionview"}, "product_version": "< 5.2.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e60c00d-8d52-3a00-a702-ad958782905f", "vendor": {"name": "rails"}}], "isExploited": false}
