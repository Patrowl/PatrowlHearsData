By modifying the folder GET parameter, it is possible to execute arbitrary SQL statements via a crafted URL. Unauthenticated remote command execution is possible by using this SQL injection to update certain database values, which are then executed by a bizRule eval() function in the yii/framework/web/auth/CAuthManager.php file. Resultant authorization bypass is also possible, by recovering or modifying password hashes and password reset tokens, allowing for administrative privileges to be obtained.", "datePublished": "2020-09-30T18:00:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:15:20", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.re-desk.com/download-help-desk-software.html", "https://labs.f-secure.com/advisories/redesk-v2-3-multiple-issues/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15487"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a7478f67-3bf4-3d46-9f47-8aa69c0145b3", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17db3e92-5c32-3b88-8884-e125258493df", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
