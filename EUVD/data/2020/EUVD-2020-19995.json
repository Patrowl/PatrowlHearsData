The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check the index provided when accessing the local variable in the LGETV and LPUTV instructions. This provides the ability to both read and write memory outside the bounds of the TVM context allocation. It can be leveraged to construct a use-after-free scenario, leading to a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.", "datePublished": "2020-11-16T20:59:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:18:44", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0005.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-27485"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "23922bb9-6c8e-3487-adb1-9eb9de69d60c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c49148b3-2800-3eaa-9473-e5d2ce1770d0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
