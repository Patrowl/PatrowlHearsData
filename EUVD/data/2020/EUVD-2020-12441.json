If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nIn a HTML editing attack scenario, an attacker could trick a user into editing a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how MSHTML engine validates input.\n", "datePublished": "2020-08-17T19:13:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:39:10", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1567"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1567"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 1.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66d3fda4-9d1f-347c-951d-59b74c3b6e22", "product": {"name": "Internet Explorer 9"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "d4a79c99-aa83-3b1f-b344-200ee6bd2c41", "product": {"name": "Internet Explorer 11"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6b572237-82f7-329b-8aaf-ce56d15c3cf6", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
