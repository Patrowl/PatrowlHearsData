The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of the affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:25:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:06:49", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-email-sec-xss-EbjXuXwP"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3137"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "15a7f098-960b-37ec-9ab9-141df07c59af", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3266791a-e79f-3a33-8866-bc4bafe1dd74", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
