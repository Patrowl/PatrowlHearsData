The vulnerability is due to a system account that has a default and static password and is not under the control of the system administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access to system data, including the configuration of an affected device. The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system, but the attacker would not have full administrative rights to control the device.", "datePublished": "2020-02-19T19:15:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:40:54", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-on-prem-static-cred-sL8rDs8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3158"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cbf0872b-1fe5-3818-9ace-da68e0bc5546", "product": {"name": "Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a86c9f9-8206-36e7-bbe8-06b8d650a912", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
