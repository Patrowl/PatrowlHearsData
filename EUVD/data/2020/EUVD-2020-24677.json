The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:22:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:19:26", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanxss-z7bhvHpy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3406"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "67664400-8023-3eb0-a0ec-c01d5afcb322", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4e98a61c-ea4a-3afa-bc7b-ea6f0769c463", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
