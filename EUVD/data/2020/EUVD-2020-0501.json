The get() method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there is a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it is returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around get() to anonymous peers. This is fixed in version 20.0.1. Note that users of SSB-Server verion 16.0.0 should upgrade to 16.0.1 to get the fixed version of SSB-DB.", "datePublished": "2020-06-11T21:15:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T07:52:20", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/security/advisories/GHSA-mpgr-2cx9-327h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4045", "https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/commit/43334d0871c9cc6220e0f6d6338499060f7761d4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-4045", "GHSA-mpgr-2cx9-327h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "45634e79-4279-3f9b-bad5-932534b16487", "product": {"name": "SSB-DB"}, "product_version": "= 20.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f0614dd-60ad-3098-8c5b-215589348d47", "vendor": {"name": "ssbc"}}], "isExploited": false}
