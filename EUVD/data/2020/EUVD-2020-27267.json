When processing an object stream from a PDF document, the application will perform a calculation in order to allocate memory for the list of indirect objects. Due to an error when calculating this size, an integer overflow may occur which can result in an undersized buffer being allocated. Later when initializing this buffer, the application can write outside its bounds which can cause a memory corruption that can lead to code execution. A specially crafted document can be delivered to a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T12:23:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:47:41", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1063"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6113"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "deb73a7a-6a50-3f00-8a9a-af2f77693a66", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
