The WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 implementations reassemble fragments with non-consecutive packet numbers. An adversary can abuse this to exfiltrate selected fragments. This vulnerability is exploitable when another device sends fragmented frames and the WEP, CCMP, or GCMP data-confidentiality protocol is used. Note that WEP is vulnerable to this attack by design.", "datePublished": "2021-05-11T19:39:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:49:07", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-26146.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4356", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4140", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-26146", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-26146.html", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wifi-faf-22epcEWu", "https://www.fragattacks.com", "https://github.com/vanhoefm/fragattacks/blob/master/SUMMARY.md", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/11/12", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-913875.pdf", "https://www.arista.com/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisories/12602-security-advisory-63"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26146"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "431530c1-d7a0-31f3-9260-924d4ae65723", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "04223407-6a5b-394e-aa00-c8821cda03da", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
