The vulnerability is due to unsafe usage of shared memory that is used by the affected software. An attacker with permissions to view system memory could exploit this vulnerability by running an application on the local system that is designed to read shared memory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the shared memory, including usernames, meeting information, or authentication tokens that could aid the attacker in future attacks.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:16:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:06:29", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-client-NBmqM9vt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3347"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f0eed131-9ddd-33cf-aafa-05a8f286ae9f", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22765973-8bdf-3ec9-bd46-c6d3fe6a5e2f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
