Credentials to such wireless interface default to well known and widely spread users (omitted) and passwords (omitted). This information is also available in past User Guides and manuals which the vendor distributed. This flaw allows cyber attackers to take control of the robot remotely and make use of the default user interfaces MiR has created, lowering the complexity of attacks and making them available to entry-level attackers. More elaborated attacks can also be established by clearing authentication and sending network requests directly. We have confirmed this flaw in MiR100 and MiR200 but according to the vendor, it might also apply to MiR250, MiR500 and MiR1000.", "datePublished": "2020-06-24T04:50:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T02:56:46", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/2557"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10270"], "assigner": "Alias", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5eb9c777-b25e-3dbc-a5da-5472dc4ae1b9", "product": {"name": "MiR100"}, "product_version": "v2.8.1.1 and before"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b2a147e-8a5b-3492-8435-4d82d1e3cfa1", "vendor": {"name": "Mobile Industrial Robots A/S"}}], "isExploited": false}
