{"id": "EUVD-2020-0205", "enisaUuid": "cb722d60-f8f6-3a1e-a457-34b116d255af", "description": "In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, a crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a tensor backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with `nullptr`. However, by changing the buffer index for a tensor and implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write one, as there is nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer dereference. The issue is patched in commit 0b5662bc, and is released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.", "datePublished": "2020-09-25T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-10-29T16:15:00", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-qh32-6jjc-qprm", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0b5662bc2be13a8c8f044d925d87fb6e56247cd8", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00065.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15209", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2020-289.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2020-324.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2020-132.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15209.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15209", "GHSA-qh32-6jjc-qprm", "PYSEC-2020-289"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12e0d482-7755-3f23-94fe-b44a28117b38", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.0.3"}, {"id": "593ad788-a883-3ff1-a267-ce8163a8a753", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.2.0, < 2.2.1"}, {"id": "6f30293a-5cee-3eca-ae80-ee257d063e17", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.3.0, < 2.3.1"}, {"id": "8752c1da-a89b-379e-a64c-0bb017c72ddf", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.1.0, < 2.1.2"}, {"id": "c963d039-71c5-380e-9a41-03a6167b90e0", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 1.15.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7d0611a9-6d51-3ac4-bac7-4bb1cd341099", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
