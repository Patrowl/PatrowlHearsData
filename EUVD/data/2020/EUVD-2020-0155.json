This is the case for example if the software is launched as a service or as a scheduled task using a system account (TempPath will be C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp). In order to be exploitable the software has to be (re)started after the attacker launch the exploit program, so for a service launched at startup, a service restart is needed (e.g. after a crash or an upgrade).", "datePublished": "2020-01-14T20:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-10-09T13:40:00", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/security/advisories/GHSA-7fcj-pq9j-wh2r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16784", "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/commit/42a67148b3bdf9211fda8499fdc5b63acdd7e6cc", "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/commit/be948cf0954707671aa499da17b10c86b6fa5e5c", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pyinstaller/PYSEC-2020-175.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16784", "GHSA-7fcj-pq9j-wh2r", "PYSEC-2020-175"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e91e1d31-11e1-3263-a3c1-97b90d46fa18", "product": {"name": "PyInstaller"}, "product_version": "< 3.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "770c843e-365b-3bb7-8201-d56863a897e0", "vendor": {"name": "PyInstaller"}}], "isExploited": false}
