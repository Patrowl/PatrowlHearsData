A maliciously crafted link to a jupyter server could redirect the browser to a different website. All jupyter servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet.", "datePublished": "2020-11-24T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:05", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-grfj-wjv9-4f9v", "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#106---2020-11-18", "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/3d83e49090289c431da253e2bdb8dc479cbcb157", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26232", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/jupyter-server/PYSEC-2020-234.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-26232.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26232", "GHSA-grfj-wjv9-4f9v", "PYSEC-2020-234"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61fdbef1-b57a-3a2b-8df6-bc77a19eee32", "product": {"name": "jupyter_server"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "519f97ed-c18e-30d9-908e-7ada7357ea20", "vendor": {"name": "jupyter"}}], "isExploited": false}
