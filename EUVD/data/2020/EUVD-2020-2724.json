Credentials to such wireless Access Point default to well known and widely spread SSID (MiR_RXXXX) and passwords (omitted). This information is also available in past User Guides and manuals which the vendor distributed. We have confirmed this flaw in MiR100 and MiR200 but it might also apply to MiR250, MiR500 and MiR1000.", "datePublished": "2020-06-24T05:05:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T03:48:18", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/2566"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10269"], "assigner": "Alias", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e52b127a-be20-3a03-9deb-9030fef21644", "product": {"name": "MiR100"}, "product_version": "v2.8.1.1 and before"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d93496a6-e5b1-3d16-a314-de14497cd66f", "vendor": {"name": "Mobile Industrial Robots A/S"}}], "isExploited": false}
