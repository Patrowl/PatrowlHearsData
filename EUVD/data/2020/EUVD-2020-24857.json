The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underling operating system with privileges of the web-based management application, which is running as a restricted user. This could result in changes being made to pages served by the web-based management application impacting the integrity or availability of the web-based management application.", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T17:41:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:37:14", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dna-cmd-injection-rrAYzOwc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3586"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0886460d-5925-3d2a-838f-0a1ad8f7dad1", "product": {"name": "Cisco DNA Spaces Connector"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0915005c-70ff-3e46-b71d-42973d80bac7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
