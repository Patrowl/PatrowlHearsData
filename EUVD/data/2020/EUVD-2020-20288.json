A write to this specific memory while freed and before use causes the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.", "datePublished": "2020-12-11T04:05:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:25:43", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27786.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1739", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1578", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-27786.html", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c1f6e3c818dd734c30f6a7eeebf232ba2cf3181d", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/03/1", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1900933", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210122-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-27786"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 8.07, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c807870c-e497-3752-8675-59a75b00a9e6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
