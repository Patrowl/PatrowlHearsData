The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:16:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:42:53", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmxss2-NL4KSSVR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3579"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ddb3a49-3a1a-3a77-8c9f-2986a9eab500", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a3a10cfc-241d-30c2-90e2-cdc76528309f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
