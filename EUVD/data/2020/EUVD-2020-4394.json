There is shell metacharacter injection via attributes to an open-audit/configuration/ URI. An attacker can exploit this by adding an excluded IP address to the global discovery settings (internally called exclude_ip). This exclude_ip value is passed to the exec function in the discoveries_helper.php file (inside the all_ip_list function) without being filtered, which means that the attacker can provide a payload instead of a valid IP address.", "datePublished": "2020-04-28T13:26:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:48:57", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-12078", "https://gist.github.com/mhaskar/dca62d0f0facc13f6364b8ed88d5a7fd", "https://shells.systems/open-audit-v3-3-1-remote-command-execution-cve-2020-12078/", "https://github.com/Opmantek/open-audit/commit/6ffc7f9032c55eaa1c37cf5e070809b7211c7e9a", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157477/Open-AudIT-Professional-3.3.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-12078"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 63.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a3934b2-934a-3d34-9cab-aec8a96a8740", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "caf73fb6-ba3d-3efb-ae5e-0b70ee04873d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
