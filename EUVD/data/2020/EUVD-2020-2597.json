An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be able to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the user must authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumes that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-local protections may be weakened.", "datePublished": "2020-05-19T15:50:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T20:01:34", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10134.html", "https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/534195/", "https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/method-vulnerability/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10134"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d462a8cb-3667-370d-8fc4-9915b54f0f2c", "product": {"name": "LE"}, "product_version": "5.2 \u22645.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "68ea9991-809c-31ad-8fae-e4c416af543f", "vendor": {"name": "Bluetooth"}}], "isExploited": false}
