It uses an executable running as a high privileged Windows service to perform administrative tasks and collect data from other processes. It distributes functionality among different processes and uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) primitives to enable the processes to cooperate. The remotely callable methods from remotable objects available through interprocess communication allow loading of arbitrary plugins (i.e., C# assemblies) from the \"%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%/Aternity Information Systems/Assistant/plugins\u201d directory, where the name of the plugin is passed as part of an XML-serialized object. However, because the name of the DLL is concatenated with the \u201c.\\plugins\u201d string, a directory traversal vulnerability exists in the way plugins are resolved.", "datePublished": "2020-07-27T13:33:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:22:30", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://aternity.force.com/customersuccess/s/article/Recorder-tool-security-notification-mitigation-steps-for-On-Prem", "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-in-steelcentral-aternity-agent-cve-2020-15592-cve-2020-15593/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15592"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "18b5cf7c-186f-3946-b5cb-3ae53ec08354", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f619ff96-359d-353a-b296-9778008f2209", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
