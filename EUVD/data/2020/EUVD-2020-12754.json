It was meant as an extension to the long standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires that any and all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid credentials, effectively forbidding any anonymous requests. The new `require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default setting that was meant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints except for the `/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this made an error that lead to not enforcing credentials on any endpoint, when enabled. CouchDB versions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this issue.", "datePublished": "2020-05-20T13:53:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:54:00", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-1955.html", "https://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/cve/2020-1955.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1955"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 2.1, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e1ac8b52-06d5-3498-b602-75c8c0f49ec4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
