It limits the admin user to a restricted shell, allowing execution of a small number of tools of the operating system. The restricted shell can be bypassed by presenting a fake vmware-tools ISO image to the guest virtual machine running SpamTitan Gateway. This ISO image should contain a valid Perl script at the vmware-freebsd-tools/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl path. The fake ISO image will be mounted and the script wmware-install.pl will be executed with super-user privileges as soon as the hidden option to install VMware Tools is selected in the main menu of the restricted shell (option number 5). The contents of the script can be whatever the attacker wants, including a backdoor or similar.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T16:37:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:05:11", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/felmoltor", "https://twitter.com/felmoltor", "https://www.titanhq.com/", "https://sensepost.com/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-24045"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5eaef8a5-4b35-3b5e-ad6d-8d25dabf3f87", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "abed3645-4c11-3370-a851-44b9173c964e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
