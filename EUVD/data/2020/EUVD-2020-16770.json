By making a request with valid sess_id, nonce, and ha1 values inside of the serialized session cookie, an attacker may alter the user value inside of this cookie, and assume the role and permissions of the user specified. By assuming the role of the user internal, which is inaccessible to end users by default, the attacker gains the permissions of the internal account, which includes the ability to flash custom firmware to the router, allowing the attacker to achieve a complete compromise.", "datePublished": "2020-09-01T17:20:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:05:11", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-24034", "https://support.sagemcom.com/fr/haut-debit", "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159026/Sagemcom-F-ST-5280-Privilege-Escalation.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-24034"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d6866de-e9fb-37df-b1ce-7e45373bbe99", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "626e0da1-e04a-300f-a6c2-1aae48cf2ece", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
