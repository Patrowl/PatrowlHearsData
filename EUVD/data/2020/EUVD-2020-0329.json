PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.", "datePublished": "2017-01-16T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T14:55:35", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/security/advisories/GHSA-4x5h-cr29-fhp6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5223", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/phpmailer/phpmailer/CVE-2017-5223.yaml", "https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/SECURITY.md", "https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/releases/tag/v5.2.22", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43056", "http://kalilinux.co/2017/01/12/phpmailer-cve-2017-5223-local-information-disclosure-vulnerability-analysis", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95328", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5223.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-5223.html", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-5223", "http://kalilinux.co/2017/01/12/phpmailer-cve-2017-5223-local-information-disclosure-vulnerability-analysis/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43056/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5223", "GHSA-4x5h-cr29-fhp6"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 8.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b352d167-1fa9-3554-acd9-77ccd51fa68a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b3ddde15-cb9a-3c13-87cd-890cc9cc702b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
