This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the web interface and CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and injecting scripting commands in the scope of the log subscription subsystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T17:40:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:38:34", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wsa-prv-esc-nPzWZrQj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3367"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "09728119-fa3a-3c9c-ba63-8f54ee26a20b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "41e93c9e-c63e-34a2-bd57-82860ca01874", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
