The vulnerabilities are due to improper boundary checks for certain user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected system. When this request is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS).", "datePublished": "2020-11-18T17:41:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:37:58", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucs-api-rce-UXwpeDHd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3470"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dce1a1f4-4915-37fb-9924-dfb08ef79d6e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Standalone)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2c8dec06-855e-3ed2-bedb-e73daa1b04bb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
