It allows users to delete arbitrary files such as wp-config.php file, which could effectively take a site offline and allow an attacker to reinstall with a WordPress instance under their control. This occurred via qsm_remove_file_fd_question, which allowed unauthenticated deletions (even though it was only intended for a person to delete their own quiz-answer files).", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T03:27:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:16:13", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:H/C:L/I:L/PR:N/S:C/UI:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/08/critical-vulnerabilities-patched-in-quiz-and-survey-master-plugin/", "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10348"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-35951"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 58.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "307d8695-fe77-36e3-8742-810770f12225", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7a085632-4952-3979-89b8-d69bb0717e47", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
