A server-side template injection was identified in the self-validating feature enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. If you are using a self-validating bean an upgrade to Dropwizard 1.3.21/2.0.3 or later is strongly recommended. The changes introduced in Dropwizard 1.3.19 and 2.0.2 for CVE-2020-5245 unfortunately did not fix the underlying issue completely. The issue has been fixed in dropwizard-validation 1.3.21 and 2.0.3 or later. We strongly recommend upgrading to one of these versions.", "datePublished": "2020-04-10T18:35:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:21:14", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/advisories/GHSA-3mcp-9wr4-cjqf", "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/advisories/GHSA-8jpx-m2wh-2v34", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11002", "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3208", "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/pull/3209", "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/commit/d5a512f7abf965275f2a6b913ac4fe778e424242", "https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/6.1/reference/en-US/html_single/#section-hibernateconstraintvalidatorcontext", "https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/security/policy#reporting-a-vulnerability"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11002", "GHSA-8jpx-m2wh-2v34"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5235df6c-675b-30bf-aae0-4801dd1c3572", "product": {"name": "dropwizard"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.21"}, {"id": "e9cac0e8-2ba4-3ef9-804d-c2f8391f6437", "product": {"name": "dropwizard"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53674a80-6b5e-35c6-8e1f-bcc9a7b0bf8c", "vendor": {"name": "dropwizard"}}], "isExploited": false}
