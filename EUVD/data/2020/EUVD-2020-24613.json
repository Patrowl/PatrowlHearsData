The vulnerability is due to improper validation of cryptographic protections on files that are downloaded by the application as part of a software update. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to go to a website that returns files to the client that are similar to files that are returned from a valid Webex website. The client may fail to properly validate the cryptographic protections of the provided files before executing them as part of an update. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the user.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:16:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:06:42", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-client-mac-X7vp65BL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3342"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb69b778-20dc-33e1-9b16-c52a42d4705c", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d7a8e00-24cd-38af-91ea-d0bce7654cd5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
