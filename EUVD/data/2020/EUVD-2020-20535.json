This OS requires installed applications and all system binaries to be signed either by the manufacturer or by the Point Of Sale application developer and distributor. The signature is a 2048-byte RSA signature verified in the kernel prior to ELF execution. Shared libraries, however, do not need to be signed, and they are not verified. An attacker may execute a custom binary by compiling it as a shared object and loading it via LD_PRELOAD.", "datePublished": "2020-11-01T17:39:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:33:56", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://git.lsd.cat/g/pax-pwn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-28045"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aadda59b-2cf6-3f68-88ec-a1efa9e37a0e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5ea76bbf-bc54-3af2-ba23-77f95a82b082", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
