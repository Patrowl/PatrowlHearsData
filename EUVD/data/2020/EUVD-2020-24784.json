These vulnerabilities are due to incorrect validations by boot scripts when specific ROM monitor (ROMMON) variables are set. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by copying a specific file to the local file system of an affected device and defining specific ROMMON variables. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have access to the root shell on the device or have physical access to the device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:51:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:00:59", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-rsp3-rce-jVHg8Z7c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3513"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8160c835-c185-30c2-ac45-c631aee19850", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f0ba8a3f-296c-3927-b267-8b733aab3feb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
