An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1) reconstructing the projective coordinate of the result of scalar multiplication by exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine coordinates; (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those projective coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a lattice attack to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:21:12", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10932.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-10932.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-10932", "https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/security-advisories", "https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2020-04", "https://tls.mbed.org/tech-updates/releases/mbedtls-2.16.6-and-2.7.15-released", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FCWN5HIF4CJ2LZTOMEBJ7Q4IMMV7ZU2V/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNOS2IIBH5WNJXZUV546PY7666DE7Y3L/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00036.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10932"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "924861ab-2d23-3e75-adf2-455a6ac48007", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f8fb505-00f9-3219-9c95-12e6f51dfdbe", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
