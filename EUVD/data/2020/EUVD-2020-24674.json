The authenticated user must have privileged EXEC permissions on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of values passed to a script that executes during device startup. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by writing values to a specific file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges each time the affected device is restarted.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:02:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:54:50", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-cmdinj-2MzhjM6K"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3403"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "576e6929-b39a-3fb9-9efb-6b5d64eeae9e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b13bccec-0758-33ae-a59b-29962f6128ed", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
