The vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet to the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) data port of an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a process crash that would cause a reload of the device.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:41:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:15:52", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-fnfv9-dos-HND6Fc9u"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3221"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0aa29731-7a67-3a91-8b8f-74efd8b8f50e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software 16.10.1"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa2a5b11-8906-345e-ab75-1466cf41879e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
