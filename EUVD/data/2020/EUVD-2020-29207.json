This vulnerability could allow JavaScript code to be executed in the user's web browser if the user is convinced to visit a crafted URL, possibly through phishing. Successful exploitation requires specific knowledge about the user\u2019s network to be included in the crafted URL. Impact is limited to the normal access restrictions and permissions of the user clicking the crafted URL, and subject to the user being able to connect to and already being authenticated to IMM2 or other systems. The JavaScript code is not executed on IMM2 itself.", "datePublished": "2020-09-15T14:20:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:25:37", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/LEN-44717"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-8340"], "assigner": "lenovo", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ba6179f-2604-3ef9-a413-8f8782f17ecb", "product": {"name": "System x IMM2 firmware"}, "product_version": "unspecified <5.60"}, {"id": "37c6a266-f23d-3fb3-9354-c15267961473", "product": {"name": "System x IMM2 firmware for x240 M5, Machine Types: 9532, 2591"}, "product_version": "unspecified <5.61"}, {"id": "89ec904a-a228-3790-81d0-481b8095b56d", "product": {"name": "System x IMM2 firmware for: x240, Machine Types: 7162, 2588;  x440, Machine Type 7167, 2590 ; x3750 M4, Machine Type: 8753 ;  x3250 M6, Machine type 3633, 3943 ; nx360 M5, Machine type 5465, 5467 ;  x280/x480/x880 X6 , Machine Type 7196, 4258 ; x3850 X6 and x3950 X6, Machine type 6241    ; x3550 M5, Machine Type 5463, 8869 ; x3650 M5, Machine Type 5462, 8871; x3500 M5, Machine Type 5464, 5478"}, "product_version": "unspecified <5.60"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e6a24ab-2faa-3a4f-bf0f-cb77e790b941", "vendor": {"name": "Lenovo"}}, {"id": "e3d9a8bc-a72c-3078-8df6-d50bbb07d032", "vendor": {"name": "IBM"}}], "isExploited": false}
