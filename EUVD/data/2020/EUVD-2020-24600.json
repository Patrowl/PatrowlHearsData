The vulnerability is due to incorrect allocation of the enable/disable action button under the role-based access control code on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a read-only user and then updating the roles of other users to disable them. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable users, including administrative users.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:40:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:26:11", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsd-Ar6BAguz"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3329"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6fac1218-99f8-313b-a6be-d86561b0cd6f", "product": {"name": "Cisco UCS Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "880e56b0-eb97-33d4-80b9-c04c0f8bd5b0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
