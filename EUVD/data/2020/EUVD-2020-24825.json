The vulnerability is due to a memory exhaustion condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of crafted TCP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust device resources, resulting in a DoS condition for traffic transiting the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:41:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:45:24", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-dos-QFcNEPfx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3554"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b410ab01-3214-307a-85be-7592838b8e11", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80c0d9da-c335-3b7b-b439-5e3c2ab412b0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
