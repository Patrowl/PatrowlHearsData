These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:21:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:54:36", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dncm-xss-AvMyAwd2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3349"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7cb3362a-c5cd-3f9e-a421-d2c3aaca5fe1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "abce2a45-2d13-3572-b899-02ac2799fa8d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
