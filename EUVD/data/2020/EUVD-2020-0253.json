Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because preflight requests should not include credentials and therefore requests should fail authentication. However a notable exception to this are Chrome based browsers when using client certificates for authentication since Chrome sends TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in violation of spec requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or received as a result of this attack.", "datePublished": "2020-01-17T18:50:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:45:35", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5397", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/bc7d01048579430b4b2df668178809b63d3f1929", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework", "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2020-5397", "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5397", "GHSA-7pm4-g2qj-j85x"], "assigner": "pivotal", "epss": 0.89, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "656e021b-69a0-34e5-9994-97f7409394e4", "product": {"name": "Spring Framework"}, "product_version": "5.2 <v5.2.3.RELEASE"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ac649bf-4efd-35ad-b521-140045989553", "vendor": {"name": "Spring"}}], "isExploited": false}
