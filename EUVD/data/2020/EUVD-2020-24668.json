{"id": "EUVD-2020-24668", "enisaUuid": "eab2c0eb-d924-3f2a-b0e5-9ab79c1d170a", "description": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multicast VPN (MVPN) implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of a specific type of BGP MVPN update message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending this specific, valid BGP MVPN update message to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause one of the BGP-related routing applications to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart. Note: The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic from only explicitly configured peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must send a specific BGP MVPN update message over an established TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer. To do so, the attacker must obtain information about the BGP peers in the trusted network of the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-08-27T15:40:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:09:56", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxosbgp-nlri-dos-458rG2OQ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3397"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9bfa6a4b-00b4-34f8-a9cb-4491beeade06", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "66d0cb21-2202-3cda-901e-33e98505b5fe", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
