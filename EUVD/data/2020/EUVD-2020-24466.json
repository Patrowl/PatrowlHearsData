The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted OSPF packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to continuously consume memory on an affected device and eventually cause it to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:25:12", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-memleak-DHpsgfnv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3195"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2441fd35-9c5e-3140-9130-6bc4e699a1d5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db959546-70d7-37c6-a064-692fc9c405ae", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
