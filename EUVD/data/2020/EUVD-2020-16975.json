The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.", "datePublished": "2020-08-25T13:45:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:12:08", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-24240.html", "https://github.com/akimd/bison/commit/be95a4fe2951374676efc9454ffee8638faaf68d", "https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-bison/2020-07/msg00051.html", "https://github.com/akimd/bison/compare/v3.7...v3.7.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-24240"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d671b770-81b7-3bfb-a055-07f47afadccf", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f07ce4fb-833b-3456-925d-98c59886991f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
