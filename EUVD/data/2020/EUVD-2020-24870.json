This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:37:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:47:37", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-rxss-L54Htxp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3599"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dd0613b0-d076-3b8b-affe-87ab1dbaf1ad", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "82dee425-255d-3daf-9139-85483e1e80aa", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
