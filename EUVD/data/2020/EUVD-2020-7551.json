The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info is used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor. The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly accessed. On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that require a specific alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a result, a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a misaligned address. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All Xen versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.", "datePublished": "2020-07-07T12:25:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:22:29", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15564.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4723", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-15564", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-327.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/07/07/5", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VB3QJJZV23Z2IDYEMIHELWYSQBUEW6JP/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MXESCOVI7AVRNC7HEAMFM7PMEO6D3AUH/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-02"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15564"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e486f735-d843-3413-91b9-c9e98cf97762", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "69872ec6-def7-3b15-b9bd-fad40e6f78b8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
