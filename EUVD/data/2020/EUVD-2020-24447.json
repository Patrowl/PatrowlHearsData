The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying certain CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, which could result in a complete system compromise.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:40:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:34:15", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rphy-cmdinject-DpEjeTgF"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3176"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1d247ce0-295f-34b8-b874-52bd225f5026", "product": {"name": "Cisco Remote PHY"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c3a8096-ef43-37c3-b8ed-2e6ffa259ec9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
