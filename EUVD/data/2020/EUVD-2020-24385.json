The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link while having an active session on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2020-02-19T19:16:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:39:53", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-dcnm-csrf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3114"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9a18dfad-0f0b-35c7-96eb-74592a8548fe", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "518067fa-c0f0-30dc-9108-228f2a2b21a6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
