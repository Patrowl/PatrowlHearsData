The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for certain fields of specific SSL/TLS messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SSL/TLS message through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after it has reloaded.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:41:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:46:10", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-ssl-dcrpt-dos-RYEkX4yy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3562"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f54344d2-2bf5-3759-8041-6cd8e4758965", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "60548c4d-24b9-3547-a7b0-1d695400b737", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
