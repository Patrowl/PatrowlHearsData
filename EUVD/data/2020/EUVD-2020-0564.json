This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege escalation, insecure deserialization & remote code execution. The overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated). This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and 10.4.6.", "datePublished": "2020-07-29T16:15:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:21", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-m5vr-3m74-jwxp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15098", "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/commit/85d3e70dff35a99ef53f4b561114acfa9e5c47e1", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms-core/CVE-2020-15098.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms/CVE-2020-15098.yaml", "https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-008"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15098", "GHSA-m5vr-3m74-jwxp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5aba4bbc-451d-3db7-b563-e5068c6982b8", "product": {"name": "TYPO3 CMS"}, "product_version": "9.0.0, < 9.5.20"}, {"id": "b0c2a1a9-5785-3945-b64a-2c9cf442cd7e", "product": {"name": "TYPO3 CMS"}, "product_version": "10.0.0, 10.4.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3f8af89f-1664-3a80-a5e0-fe3745920027", "vendor": {"name": "TYPO3"}}], "isExploited": false}
