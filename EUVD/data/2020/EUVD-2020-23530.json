Nearly all of the AJAX action endpoints lacked permission checks, allowing these actions to be executed by anyone authenticated on the site. This happened because nonces were used as a means of authorization, but a nonce was present in a publicly viewable page. The greatest impact was the pagelayer_save_content function that allowed pages to be modified and allowed XSS to occur.", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T03:27:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:16:13", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:L/C:L/I:L/PR:L/S:C/UI:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/05/high-severity-vulnerabilities-in-pagelayer-plugin-affect-over-200000-wordpress-sites/", "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/10239"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-35947"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a869d022-81e5-3346-87ae-a72903669fc8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "18bc46eb-af1f-3b15-bcf4-0c778a94b9f2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
