The vulnerability exists because TCP Intercept is invoked when the embryonic connection limit is reached, which can cause the underlying detection engine to process the packet incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic that matches a policy on which TCP Intercept is configured. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to match on an incorrect policy, which could allow the traffic to be forwarded when it should be dropped. In addition, the traffic could incorrectly be dropped.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:40:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:46:42", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-tcp-intercept-bypass-xG9M3PbY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3565"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c768ea70-13a7-3461-bd64-9a1f346460d2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67548ec0-bc8b-3dbd-9ace-270d018f424b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
