For this issue to occur all of these conditions must be true: (1) 'Save User Credential' option should be set to 'Yes' in the GlobalProtect Portal's Agent configuration, (2) the GlobalProtect user manually selects a gateway, (3) and the logging level is set to 'Dump' while collecting troubleshooting logs. This issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms (for example iOS/Android/Linux). This issue affects GlobalProtect app 5.0 versions earlier than 5.0.9, GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than 5.1.2 on Windows or MacOS. Since becoming aware of the issue, Palo Alto Networks has safely deleted all the known GlobalProtectLogs zip files sent by customers with the credentials. We now filter and remove these credentials from all files sent to Customer Support. The GlobalProtectLogs zip files uploaded to Palo Alto Networks systems were only accessible by authorized personnel with valid Palo Alto Networks credentials. We do not have any evidence of malicious access or use of these credentials.", "datePublished": "2020-05-13T19:07:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:30:43", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2020-2004"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-2004"], "assigner": "palo_alto", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55490410-5f9c-3acd-9b18-2692cfae2231", "product": {"name": "GlobalProtect App"}, "product_version": "5.0 <5.0.9"}, {"id": "cea8f9b4-7292-37be-9f87-81a89ad306e4", "product": {"name": "GlobalProtect App"}, "product_version": "5.1 <5.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80280267-14a7-372e-a773-b7f3aeb8156c", "vendor": {"name": "Palo Alto Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
