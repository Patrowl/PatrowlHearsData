The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests sent to the REST API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition that is due to high CPU utilization. Manual intervention may be required to recover the Cisco IND.", "datePublished": "2020-10-08T04:20:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:52:38", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ind-dos-BwG634zn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3567"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "99a81c1e-7f55-3190-98d8-ae395cc78d61", "product": {"name": "Cisco Industrial Network Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "138fd8cf-1b7f-3277-ac22-db4239e83495", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
