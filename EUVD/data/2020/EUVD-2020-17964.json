When using a client certificate to enroll over the EST protocol, no revocation check is performed on that certificate. This vulnerability can only affect a system that has EST configured, uses client certificates to authenticate enrollment, and has had such a certificate revoked. This certificate needs to belong to a role that is authorized to enroll new end entities. (To completely mitigate this problem prior to upgrade, remove any revoked client certificates from their respective roles.)", "datePublished": "2020-09-11T15:15:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:33:05", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://support.primekey.com/news/posts/ejbca-security-advisory-revocation-check-not-performed-on-est-client-certificate"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-25276"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f62fb0f2-22ed-391e-a6a0-aaaf45bb4871", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ee5f103-2cb1-3e24-90e8-3717d38d33c3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
