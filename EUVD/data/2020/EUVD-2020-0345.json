They would then have the permissions of the PHP process. This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to upload images in any area of the application. The issue was addressed in a series of patches in versions 0.25.3, 0.25.4 and 0.25.5. Users should upgrade to at least v0.25.5 to avoid this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-03-09T15:50:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:22:09", "baseScore": 7.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-g9rq-x4fj-f5hx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5256", "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.3", "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.4", "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.25.5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5256", "GHSA-g9rq-x4fj-f5hx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0432a36d-2272-3ca1-bb81-717548cbfc59", "product": {"name": "BookStack"}, "product_version": "< 0.25.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "778789cc-e3d9-3762-a391-b41eb1a59fc9", "vendor": {"name": "BookStackApp"}}], "isExploited": false}
