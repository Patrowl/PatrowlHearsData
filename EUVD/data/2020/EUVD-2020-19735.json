The missing check involves verifying that the command target device is configured giving permission for the gateway device to act on its behalf. This means an authenticated device of a certain tenant, notably also a non-gateway device acting like a gateway, may receive command & control messages targeted at a different device of the same tenant without corresponding permissions getting checked.", "datePublished": "2021-01-14T22:35:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:11:36", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=569856"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-27220"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e96c7ec4-de1b-3757-9448-bfbf0101c3e2", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Hono"}, "product_version": "1.4.0 to 1.4.4 inclusive, 1.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "398356c2-6140-3640-9a29-38f430324c0a", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
