The vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T17:40:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:42:42", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-voip-phones-rce-dos", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156203/Cisco-Discovery-Protocol-CDP-Remote-Device-Takeover.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3111"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "987ae910-633b-3163-8cda-1fce9fc8bb4c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP phone"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.7(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a2b84314-b43f-307e-bb4e-1cadff5e007f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
