{"id": "EUVD-2020-18348", "enisaUuid": "45e8b2de-4658-3d7e-8084-a24bab92262e", "description": "A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a query, dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the same name and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150 pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts that it would have to perform to forge a reply and have it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the \"Birthday Attacks\" section of RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.", "datePublished": "2021-01-20T16:47:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:12:14", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-25686.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4844", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0401", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0395", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0245", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0240", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0156", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0155", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0154", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0153", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0152", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0151", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0150", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-25686", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-25686.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-25686", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-25686.html", "https://www.jsof-tech.com/disclosures/dnspooq/", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1890125", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYW3IR6APUSKOYKL5FT3ACTIHWHGQY32/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-17", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGB7HL3OWHTLEPSMLDGOMXQKG3KM2QME/", "https://www.arista.com/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisories/12135-security-advisory-61", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25686", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGB7HL3OWHTLEPSMLDGOMXQKG3KM2QME", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WYW3IR6APUSKOYKL5FT3ACTIHWHGQY32", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/434904"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-25686"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8fdb8421-f59e-32f4-abe6-195b3f5925fe", "product": {"name": "dnsmasq"}, "product_version": "dnsmasq 2.83"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8e22a7c-3fb8-3cf5-b34b-dfc86a4bef18", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
