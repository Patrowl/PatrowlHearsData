The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Webex player application to crash when trying to view the malicious file.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T16:55:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:20:18", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvs98259"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3321"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17b8a7bc-9bd8-302e-870f-78082a14fe2d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2"}, {"id": "23dfeb71-1c33-3d13-8c29-d3b46da10da0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Network Recording Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0 MR3"}, {"id": "affe0457-b134-3387-8466-c8b64ad93c47", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0 MR3 Security Patch 2"}, {"id": "f158fcfc-f67c-3140-ac03-efe7ec89cfe7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0 MR3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7d91d2bb-c09c-3fdb-811c-ccd79aca9787", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
