The attacker must have valid Local Manager credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based Local Manager interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a system settings tab. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:55:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:12:07", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ioxxss-wc6CqUws"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3233"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cd38c1e1-8fe2-36a4-999b-6d25c197b872", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOx"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c002953f-7dfb-3db1-9c3c-8d394e31612e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
