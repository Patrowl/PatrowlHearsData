{"id": "EUVD-2020-24459", "enisaUuid": "ab4235c7-ebd1-3cf5-94df-e3c720419f9b", "description": "A vulnerability in how Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software handles session timeouts for management connections could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buildup of remote management connections to an affected device, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because the default session timeout period for specific to-the-box remote management connections is too long. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large and sustained number of crafted remote management connections to an affected device, resulting in a buildup of those connections over time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the remote management interface or Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) to stop responding and cause other management functions to go offline, resulting in a DoS condition. The user traffic that is flowing through the device would not be affected, and the DoS condition would be isolated to remote management only.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:25:40", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-mgmt-interface-dos-FkG4MuTU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3188"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "51b6b1dd-41d5-3734-9250-e237e1566ece", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5978d79e-0e25-3f08-84e6-11d368542960", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
