The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:26:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:07:17", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nfvis-path-emy79OC2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3365"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "28800ebc-db8d-30a9-9841-2aa8c680a68e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "151241e0-610d-3471-84b1-ed20d27cd526", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
