When an encrypted tunnel is created between two hosts, the kernel isn't correctly routing tunneled data over the encrypted link; rather sending the data unencrypted. This would allow anyone in between the two endpoints to read the traffic unencrypted. The main threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.", "datePublished": "2020-09-09T14:35:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:46:30", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-1749.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0354", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4062", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4060", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1769", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1567", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-1749", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2020-1749.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-1749.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1749", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20201222-0001/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1749"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0f8d15a1-9a4d-33cb-bde6-72ddaf90169a", "product": {"name": "Kernel"}, "product_version": "5.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75b0de7e-d89a-3a6b-b8a2-391ce1763cb9", "vendor": {"name": "Linux kernel"}}], "isExploited": false}
