More precisely, it is possible to inject an XSS payload into the owner POST parameter, which does not filter user inputs. By putting an XSS payload in place of a valid Owner Name, a modal box appears that writes an error message concatenated to the injected payload (without any form of data encoding). This can also be exploited via CSRF.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T21:40:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:53:17", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2020-0843"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-17454"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "27bf36b2-a5b0-3ef5-9db9-a3161bc82c6a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "77176ad5-37cd-385f-b8be-b0698df40d84", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
