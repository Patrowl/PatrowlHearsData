Users that use lookatme to render untrusted markdown may have malicious shell commands automatically run on their system. This is fixed in version 2.3.0. As a workaround, the `lookatme/contrib/terminal.py` and `lookatme/contrib/file_loader.py` files may be manually deleted. Additionally, it is always recommended to be aware of what is being rendered with lookatme.", "datePublished": "2020-10-26T18:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-11-13T16:40:00", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/security/advisories/GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q", "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/commit/72fe36b784b234548d49dae60b840c37f0eb8d84", "https://pypi.org/project/lookatme/#history", "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/releases/tag/v2.3.0", "https://github.com/d0c-s4vage/lookatme/pull/110", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15271", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/lookatme/PYSEC-2020-61.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15271", "GHSA-c84h-w6cr-5v8q", "PYSEC-2020-61"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0af40ac8-2428-351a-9f74-bc4f69b490d3", "product": {"name": "lookatme"}, "product_version": "< 2.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6c679a68-5401-3cc6-9294-2af0b3e3fd8c", "vendor": {"name": "d0c-s4vage"}}], "isExploited": false}
