An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.", "datePublished": "2020-09-25T12:58:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:32:14", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/09/nitf-extract75-cve-2020-13995/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-13995"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8dd890e9-2a8f-3084-9933-cf720a5b1804", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "683c6f75-5d32-3908-9e7a-a969c651b94a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
