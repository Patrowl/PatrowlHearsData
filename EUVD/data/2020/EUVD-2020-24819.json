An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted TLS packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a prolonged state of high CPU utilization. The affected device would still be operative, but response time and overall performance may be degraded.There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T15:53:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-18T16:32:04", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/RL:X/RC:X/E:X", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-tls-dos-xW53TBhb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3548"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "06e3de07-dc51-3842-9ceb-7f3467a71756", "product": {"name": "Cisco Secure Email"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9afdd52-db05-3e5a-acf7-f0072bb97841", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
