An attacker can create a specially-crafted hostname or service name to be imported by Metasploit from a variety of sources and trigger a command injection on the operator's terminal. Note, only the Metasploit Framework and products that expose the plugin system is susceptible to this issue -- notably, this does not include Rapid7 Metasploit Pro. Also note, this vulnerability cannot be triggered through a normal scan operation -- the attacker would have to supply a file that is processed with the db_import command.", "datePublished": "2020-04-22T21:25:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T00:51:34", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2020-7350", "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/issues/13026"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-7350"], "assigner": "rapid7", "epss": 58.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89624397-15ee-359f-b636-ec9b82972da6", "product": {"name": "Metasploit Framework"}, "product_version": "5.0.85 <5.0.85"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "85286b9d-f1d6-3a0d-8958-fa90638d27a0", "vendor": {"name": "Rapid7"}}], "isExploited": false}
