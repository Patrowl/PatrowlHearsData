{"id": "EUVD-2020-0840", "enisaUuid": "24fe7d24-f66c-333d-ab6a-b7cd6bc0317b", "description": "In Symfony before versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5, the CachingHttpClient class from the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the HttpCache class to handle requests. HttpCache uses internal headers like X-Body-Eval and X-Body-File to control the restoration of cached responses. The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario). But when used by CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the response for a request being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote code execution is possible. This has been fixed in versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5.", "datePublished": "2020-09-02T17:35:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/symfony/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-754h-5r27-7x3r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15094", "https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d9910e0b33a2e0f993abff41c6fbc86951b66d78", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/http-kernel/CVE-2020-15094.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/symfony/symfony/CVE-2020-15094.yaml", "https://github.com/symfony/symfony", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HNGUWOEETOFVH4PN3I3YO4QZHQ4AUKF3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VAQJXAKWPMWB7OL6QPG2ZSEQZYYPU5RC", "https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/http-kernel", "https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/symfony", "https://symfony.com/cve-2020-15094", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VAQJXAKWPMWB7OL6QPG2ZSEQZYYPU5RC/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HNGUWOEETOFVH4PN3I3YO4QZHQ4AUKF3/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VAQJXAKWPMWB7OL6QPG2ZSEQZYYPU5RC/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HNGUWOEETOFVH4PN3I3YO4QZHQ4AUKF3/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15094", "GHSA-754h-5r27-7x3r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84547c2b-c0ac-38ad-afa4-98ce95ca80ac", "product": {"name": "symfony"}, "product_version": "4.4.0, < 4.4.13"}, {"id": "c9b83d51-213f-366d-bd85-e11f80b3454b", "product": {"name": "symfony"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.1.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "edb6521a-7d88-3828-9e25-1d1466f36f80", "vendor": {"name": "symfony"}}], "isExploited": false}
