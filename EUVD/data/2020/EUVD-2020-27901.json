It allows an attacker to read or execute files under $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/ROOT/assets (which should be a protected directory). Additionally, attackers can upload temporary files (e.g., .jsp files) into /webapps/ROOT/assets/tmp_upload, which can lead to remote command execution (with the permissions of the user running the dotCMS application).", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T16:08:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T09:11:04", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://dotcms.com/security/SI-54", "https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17796"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6754"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 75.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6d037535-2592-345e-bb3a-8a0c87226feb", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cb50f45c-e452-377a-98b2-a26b8c31eb01", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
