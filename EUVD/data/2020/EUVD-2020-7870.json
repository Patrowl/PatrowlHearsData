There exist a few pages that are directly accessible by any unauthorized user, e.g., logout.php and login.php. This occurs because of checking the value of NO_NEED_AUTH. If the value of NO_NEED_AUTH is 1, the user has direct access to the webpage without any authentication. By appending a query string NO_NEED_AUTH with the value of 1 to any protected URL, any unauthorized user can access the application directly, as demonstrated by bsc_lan.php?NO_NEED_AUTH=1.", "datePublished": "2020-07-22T18:55:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:30:23", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10169", "https://research.loginsoft.com/bugs/authentication-bypass-in-d-link-firmware-dap-1522/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15896"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3992d46b-6d0e-35c2-8d7f-f40024b82612", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e19efb47-2305-39e7-bbc8-c8ef4817d28d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
