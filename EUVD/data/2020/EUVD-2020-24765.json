These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of CAPWAP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malformed CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:52:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:59:34", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-capwap-dos-TPdNTdyq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3494"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5f4978de-dff1-38c3-b728-297e76b1ec24", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ba5ef11-d29d-3eb1-98b2-df1dada24cb9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
