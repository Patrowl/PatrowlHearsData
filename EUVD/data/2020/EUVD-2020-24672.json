The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:22:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:19:34", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmandowndir-CVGvdKM3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3401"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "939f9094-d902-39a3-bdf0-429d974b3a58", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9eb229fe-8adf-3df2-ae54-ee051c37c45f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
