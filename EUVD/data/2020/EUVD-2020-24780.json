The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) messages are parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious DHCPv4 message to or through a WAN interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device. Note: On Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers, all of the following are considered WAN interfaces: 10 Gbps Ethernet interfaces 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces Port channel interfaces that include multiple 10 and/or 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:51:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:00:22", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-dhcp-dos-JSCKX43h"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3509"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9af9287c-a77e-3f7a-b443-16fd079ba441", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "110bd126-965b-3eae-a92c-cefceb2d6f00", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
