The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections in the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user, with an active administrative session on the affected device, to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to change the device's configuration, which could include the ability to edit or create user accounts of any privilege level. Some changes to the device's configuration could negatively impact the availability of networking services for other devices on networks managed by CPNR.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:40:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:35:16", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cpnr-csrf-WWTrDkyL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3148"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c71d0cb6-be48-3042-a56d-0427338df813", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Network Registrar"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53b91407-e418-3bc4-af3e-9ed827324e81", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
