The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:16:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:42:26", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanxss1-XhJCymBt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3590"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "056d44a2-c8a8-3cb2-a51b-18b340beeaba", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd2c19fd-3df8-3173-b44a-22ab86fed7fc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
