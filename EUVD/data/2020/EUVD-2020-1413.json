The problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater. A possible workaround is provided in the linked advisory.", "datePublished": "2020-10-05T18:30:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/security/advisories/GHSA-5jjv-x4fq-qjwp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15237", "https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine/commit/1b27090ce31543bf39f186c20ea47c8250fca2f0", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/shrine/CVE-2020-15237.yml", "https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15237", "GHSA-5jjv-x4fq-qjwp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee3eacca-527c-3117-a1f2-8a4441fb4029", "product": {"name": "shrine"}, "product_version": "< 3.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ace81a2f-ba34-32cb-868b-7acede9d9910", "vendor": {"name": "shrinerb"}}], "isExploited": false}
