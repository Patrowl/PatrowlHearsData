{"id": "EUVD-2020-0192", "enisaUuid": "76330393-2839-348f-af78-d0787339403c", "description": "In Tensorflow version 2.3.0, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` and `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementations don't validate that the `weights` tensor has the same shape as the data. The check exists for `DenseCountSparseOutput`, where both tensors are fully specified. In the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel with the data. But, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer weights than the values for the tensors can generate a read from outside the bounds of the heap buffer allocated for the weights. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.", "datePublished": "2020-09-25T19:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-09-01T08:19:33", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-pg59-2f92-5cph", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.3.1", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15196", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2020-276.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2020-311.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow/PYSEC-2020-119.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15196", "GHSA-pg59-2f92-5cph", "PYSEC-2020-276"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2fe1d44f-bf4e-36d8-866e-074ed8e35d65", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "= 2.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f531187-50e2-3a10-a881-80e43719b276", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
