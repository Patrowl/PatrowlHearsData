For most people, this fix will have a little or no impact. However, if you are relying on node-fetch to gate files above a size, the impact could be significant, for example: If you don't double-check the size of the data after fetch() has completed, your JS thread could get tied up doing work on a large file (DoS) and/or cost you money in computing.", "datePublished": "2020-09-10T18:25:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:08:22", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/security/advisories/GHSA-w7rc-rwvf-8q5r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15168", "https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/commit/2358a6c2563d1730a0cdaccc197c611949f6a334", "https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/commit/eaff0094c4dfdd5b78711a8c4f1b61e33d282072", "https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-15168.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2021:0729", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15168", "GHSA-w7rc-rwvf-8q5r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2e222fc4-e070-3496-a4c9-ffbfe9945d4e", "product": {"name": "node-fetch"}, "product_version": "<2.6.1"}, {"id": "a19d0e3a-507b-3aca-a8cb-edc842ad6faa", "product": {"name": "node-fetch"}, "product_version": ">3.0.0-beta.1, <3.0.0-beta.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd49dfdf-a08c-374f-a64e-c1457acaf6a8", "vendor": {"name": "node-fetch"}}], "isExploited": false}
