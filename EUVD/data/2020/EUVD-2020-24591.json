The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first entering input within the web-based management interface and then persuading a user of the interface to view the crafted input within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-10-08T04:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:53:34", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-yLrjqqU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3320"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ef0896b-e2bf-3e19-bc17-8c4d3cfa5316", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b6604a3-0413-3f7f-8284-2dd48ef2b059", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
