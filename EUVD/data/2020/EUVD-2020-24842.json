The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation upon receiving ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of crafted ICMP or ICMPv6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory exhaustion condition that may result in an unexpected reload. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after the reload.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:40:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:46:50", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-icmp-dos-hxxcycM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3571"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7c576634-7448-3506-b996-a8da1391333b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "355cd49e-c992-3b4a-8caa-4bc0965a6068", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
