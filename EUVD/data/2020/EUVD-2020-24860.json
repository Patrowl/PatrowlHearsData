The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2020-10-08T04:20:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:52:16", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxs-mf5cbYx5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3589"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b22aa77-ee6f-300e-9a5d-1a0f63e10d73", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "24dbb216-7f2a-33ef-b625-41f21bdaed3d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
