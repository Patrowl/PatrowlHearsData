An attacker could cause `move_desc` to get stuck in a 4,294,967,295-count iteration loop. Depending on how `vhost_crypto` is being used this could prevent other VMs or network tasks from being serviced by the busy DPDK lcore for an extended period.", "datePublished": "2020-09-30T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:46:33", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14378.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-14378", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/09/28/3", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1879473", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4550-1/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00004.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-10/msg00006.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/04/2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-14378"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a2a01b16-2b25-3fa0-b737-a3df9923d3b0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
