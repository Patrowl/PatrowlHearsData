The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options() parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a single packet. While processing the options, packet_data_pptr is accessed after being incremented by option_len without a prior out-of-bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a correct range, but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is derived from the amount of allocated heap memory, not the actual input size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may be insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by packet_data_pptr. As a result, access to a memory area outside of the intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T18:24:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T12:11:19", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os/issues/12928", "https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-coap/pull/116"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-12884"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "01cd8483-16c3-322d-8768-8809eb0efb6a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "469cd648-eb3c-38c1-9f82-ddb50a388290", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
