The vulnerability is due to insufficient TCP ingress packet rate limiting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high and sustained rate of crafted TCP traffic to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact operations of the phone or cause the phone to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:16:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:43:05", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-voip-phone-flood-dos-YnU9EXOv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3574"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.76, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb42a9a4-e55c-3e60-9b2f-ce7b0da8821e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "61725a86-147a-37c6-9525-0a92d0a40ab6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
