The vulnerability is due to improper validation of specific HTTP request headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a prolonged status of high CPU utilization relative to the GUI process(es). Upon successful exploitation of this vulnerability, an affected device will still be operative, but its response time and overall performance may be degraded.", "datePublished": "2020-03-04T18:40:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:34:32", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cont-sec-gui-dos-nJ625dXb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3164"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9a9389e4-f515-3c1b-a042-992fb55a5974", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3f873fa1-b034-3261-8826-9b26c3079790", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
