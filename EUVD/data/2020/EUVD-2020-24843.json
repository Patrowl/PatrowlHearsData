The vulnerability is due to a memory leak when closing SSL/TLS connections in a specific state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing several SSL/TLS sessions and ensuring they are closed under certain conditions. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory resources in the affected device, which would prevent it from processing new SSL/TLS connections, resulting in a DoS. Manual intervention is required to recover an affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-10-21T18:40:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:47:00", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-tcp-dos-N3DMnU4T"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3572"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.86, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f14b8f57-5723-301b-8f2a-182304e640d9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9fe24155-65dc-3298-9482-913a5f486fa7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
