{"id": "EUVD-2020-24390", "enisaUuid": "191baff7-100a-3387-8e04-1e49365f6833", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the Cisco Discovery Protocol parser does not properly validate input for certain fields in a Cisco Discovery Protocol message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. An successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges on an affected device. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T17:45:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:42:33", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-nxos-cdp-rce", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156203/Cisco-Discovery-Protocol-CDP-Remote-Device-Takeover.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3119"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 7.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc9f3f8b-45e1-35c3-941f-d551c6ddb698", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.3(2)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d16d5db-fe93-3674-b1be-5045bbad0326", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
