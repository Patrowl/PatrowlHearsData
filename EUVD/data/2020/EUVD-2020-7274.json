The problem has been patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `> 1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.", "datePublished": "2020-10-26T18:20:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:15:19", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/security/advisories/GHSA-hgx2-4pp9-357g", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/commit/9f30756375cc4b1b6c66f274fc9c591fa901455a", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/git-tag-annotation-action/releases/tag/v1.0.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15272"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7a329204-f428-339b-b511-cb9cd7e1763e", "product": {"name": "git-tag-annotation-action"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a56ce5b2-c2ff-3c31-8219-0fc9c37f6710", "vendor": {"name": "ericcornelissen"}}], "isExploited": false}
