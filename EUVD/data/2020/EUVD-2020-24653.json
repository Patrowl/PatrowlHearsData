The vulnerability exists because different installations share a static encryption key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static key to craft a valid session token. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges.", "datePublished": "2020-07-31T00:00:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:17:42", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-bypass-dyEejUMs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3382"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 13.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8b6b4a0b-d923-32f1-9908-02c0bb41bb01", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dcf7eb72-43a0-354f-bb40-423618cff352", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
