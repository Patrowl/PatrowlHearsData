The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted client login request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition for new login attempts. Users who are authenticated at the time of the attack would not be affected. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-11-06T18:15:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:44:46", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-imp-dos-uTx2dqu2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-27121"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.63, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ec765de6-dd20-3c53-917b-b1c35dbf8ba4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22cb12ed-56f0-3e44-95b0-c44ca9503b56", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
