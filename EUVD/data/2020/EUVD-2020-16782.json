It limits the admin user to a restricted shell, allowing execution of a small number of tools of the operating system. This restricted shell can be bypassed after changing the properties of the user admin in the operating system file /etc/passwd. This file cannot be accessed though the restricted shell, but it can be modified by abusing the Backup/Import Backup functionality of the web interface. An authenticated attacker would be able to obtain the file /var/tmp/admin.passwd after executing a Backup operation. This file can be manually modified to change the GUID of the user to 0 (root) and change the restricted shell to a normal shell /bin/sh. After the modification is done, the file can be recompressed to a .tar.bz file and imported again via the Import Backup functionality. The properties of the admin user will be overwritten and a root shell will be granted to the user upon the next successful login.", "datePublished": "2020-09-17T16:39:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:05:11", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/felmoltor", "https://twitter.com/felmoltor", "https://www.titanhq.com", "https://sensepost.com/blog/2020/clash-of-the-spamtitan/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-24046"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d84f6a10-e928-35b2-893e-f881c0a239d4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "27db56a3-8bcd-3494-96d4-473cca37d4ce", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
