The vulnerabilities are due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted MGCP packets through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory exhaustion resulting in a restart of an affected device, causing a DoS condition for traffic traversing the device.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:41:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:24:31", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-mgcp-SUqB8VKH"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3254"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee6adbd8-2232-31d6-9cdb-dd15961d8182", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "101ce8fa-d991-3d74-99b6-a094f38b3237", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
