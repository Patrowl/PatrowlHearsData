The vulnerability is due to incorrect packet processing during the WPA2 and WPA3 authentication handshake when configured for dot1x or pre-shared key (PSK) authentication key management (AKM) with 802.11r BSS Fast Transition (FT) enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:53:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:57:13", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wpa-dos-cXshjerc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3429"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "37fd0a56-69ae-3b5d-85f0-bbd9a6429510", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "678c1d82-70db-37cd-9d75-8959f2ae70a0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
