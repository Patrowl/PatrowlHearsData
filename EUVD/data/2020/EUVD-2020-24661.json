The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap in relation to a wireless client connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an 802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of a connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, causing a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:02:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:54:02", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-ewlc-snmp-dos-wNkedg9K"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3390"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "641df279-a7dc-3a73-a143-9564fd3016de", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4fa398b-327d-32a5-b2f0-0fe59e2cd8d2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
