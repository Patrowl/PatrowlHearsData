If such a malformed event is accepted into the room's state, the impact is long-lasting and is not fixed by an upgrade to a newer version, requiring the event to be manually redacted instead. Since events are replicated to servers of other room members, the impact is not constrained to the server of the event sender.", "datePublished": "2020-11-24T03:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:06", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4mp3-385r-v63f", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U34DPP4ZLOEDUY2ZCWOHQPU5GA5LYNUQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G7YXMMYQP46PYL664JQUXCA3LPBJU7DQ/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26890", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/matrix-synapse/PYSEC-2020-237.yaml", "https://pypi.org/project/matrix-synapse", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-26890.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-26890", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/U34DPP4ZLOEDUY2ZCWOHQPU5GA5LYNUQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/G7YXMMYQP46PYL664JQUXCA3LPBJU7DQ/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26890", "GHSA-4mp3-385r-v63f", "PYSEC-2020-237"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aae91bb2-56e9-31c8-9aa3-d37bfcb95891", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0e9f264a-7fc9-3d5d-be5d-6d92ba555a47", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
