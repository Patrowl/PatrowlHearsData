The vulnerability occurs because the USB 3.0 SSD control data is not stored on the internal boot flash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by removing the USB 3.0 SSD, modifying or deleting files on the USB 3.0 SSD by using another device, and then reinserting the USB 3.0 SSD on the original device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remove container protections and perform file actions outside the namespace of the container with root privileges.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T18:02:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T17:54:22", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iox-usb-guestshell-WmevScDj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3396"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a419a871-5c5c-3116-b6cb-ffe26936017c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f515be9a-c74d-396f-af2a-872da3fa39f1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
