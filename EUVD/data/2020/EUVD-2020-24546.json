The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:21:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:58:15", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-Rj5JRfF8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3275"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ce7e36be-5741-3eac-93ad-4f30de4517f9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67815f5c-d912-33da-af21-2e79dc86c200", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
