An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T15:54:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-18T16:33:19", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-cuc-imp-xss-XtpzfM5e", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-tls-dos-xW53TBhb", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-authbypass-YVJzqgk2", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-pa-trav-bMdfSTTq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3532"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02a8d21d-f296-3488-bd40-9f6051f7a989", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "N/A"}, {"id": "0f581ba9-15bc-37b4-b8d0-85ffe72e46e6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service"}, "product_version": "N/A"}, {"id": "11195b45-0420-37ac-b164-8da9fa312691", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager / Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "N/A"}, {"id": "34e056b0-5ae1-32ee-b2dc-4a4a40a6d65a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9b8b08f-b2af-3864-90bf-6a92850205c2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
