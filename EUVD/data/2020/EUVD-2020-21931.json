The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped. However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence, the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting / disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux blkback.", "datePublished": "2020-12-15T17:00:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:55:10", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-29569.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4843", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-29569", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2020-29569.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-29569.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-350.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0001/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/02/msg00018.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00010.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-30"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-29569"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "92560870-d011-3a6b-aa47-a95b48d421c8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "78acf322-e761-3970-aa18-b9d5e5d339ca", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
