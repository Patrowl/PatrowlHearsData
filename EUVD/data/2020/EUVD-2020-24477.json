The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate 802.11w disassociation and deauthentication PMFs that it receives. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed 802.11w PMF from a valid, authenticated client on a network adjacent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate a single valid user connection to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:40:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:18:56", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-dos-AnvKvMxR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3206"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "74fe0c33-2b79-3b7c-b6a3-30d01ba7ef80", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software 16.10.1"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53d1c430-0f8a-3346-bab9-135ecfe83b56", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
