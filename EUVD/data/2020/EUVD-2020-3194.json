{"id": "EUVD-2020-3194", "enisaUuid": "d6ec61b0-d3a3-3933-9261-bbe07dfc22c3", "description": "A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel module, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the /sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in the /dev/ directory. This read allocates kernel memory and is not accounted for a user that triggers the creation of that ZRAM device. With this vulnerability, continually reading the device may consume a large amount of system memory and cause the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer to activate and terminate random userspace processes, possibly making the system inoperable.", "datePublished": "2020-09-16T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T11:14:15", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-10781.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-10781", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2020-10781.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-10781.html", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=853eab68afc80f59f36bbdeb715e5c88c501e680", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-10781", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/18/1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/09/msg00025.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10781"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69eabf64-37a6-379e-a030-fc7d25633e56", "product": {"name": "Kernel"}, "product_version": "before 5.8-rc6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "366e1de6-b87a-3284-ad15-9c914b76244d", "vendor": {"name": "Linux kernel"}}], "isExploited": false}
