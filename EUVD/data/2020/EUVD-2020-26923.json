An attacker can exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a \"sender\" and sending a MessageType of \"FILE_LIST\" with a \"name\" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the intended \"/sdcard/MXshare\" directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by writing \".odex\" and \".vdex\" files in the \"oat\" directory of the MX Player application.", "datePublished": "2020-07-08T13:34:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:39:25", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2020-41"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-5764"], "assigner": "tenable", "epss": 0.65, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17b86274-6735-3db0-ad3f-1c596b291477", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
