The vulnerability is due to improper memory protection mechanisms while processing certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malformed OSPF packets in a short period of time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T16:42:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:23:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-dos-RhMQY8qx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3298"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "461b5c62-e7f8-3c13-b6bd-a27ba583531b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86a07846-26c9-3856-8ba8-95f8b79bf987", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
