One of the limitations of this feature is that it only takes a path to a binary without arguments; however, this can be circumvented using special shell variables, such as '${IFS}'. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands as 'root' on the units.", "datePublished": "2020-08-21T14:28:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:05:11", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://ioactive.com/moog-exo-series-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "https://ioac.tv/3hy1xu6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-24054"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.63, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "beb86ebd-5870-3fbc-85f5-dc5e857f24d6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "005a9320-ef82-3f3f-a413-1eb7b7c6801d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
