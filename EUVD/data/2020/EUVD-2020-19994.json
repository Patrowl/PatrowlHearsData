The attack vector is: To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter fails to check for overflow when allocating the array for the NEWA instruction. This a constrained read/write primitive across the entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted application execution environment.", "datePublished": "2020-11-16T20:59:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:18:44", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0004.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-27484"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5c624f1f-fc69-3118-b71f-38eaeba4702b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b3ca3ff-1fae-3e72-ba5c-eed7644d83cb", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
