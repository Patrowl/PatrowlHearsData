This is the result of a bad set up and can be mitigated by appropriately configuring ROS and/or applying custom patches as appropriate. Currently, the ROS computational graph can be accessed fully from the wired exposed ports. In combination with other flaws such as CVE-2020-10269, the computation graph can also be fetched and interacted from wireless networks. This allows a malicious operator to take control of the ROS logic and correspondingly, the complete robot given that MiR's operations are centered around the framework (ROS).", "datePublished": "2020-06-24T04:40:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:02:17", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/2555"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-10271"], "assigner": "Alias", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29f46266-0fe8-348b-b813-72c18dd4c706", "product": {"name": "MiR100"}, "product_version": "v2.8.1.1 and before"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e6cb0bbc-f0a8-343b-ae87-d8d2dae59b0f", "vendor": {"name": "Mobile Industrial Robots A/S"}}], "isExploited": false}
