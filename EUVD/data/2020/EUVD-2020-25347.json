This mechanism allows a developer to specify which components of the application should not be loaded by default when the application is started. Typically, core components and additional dependencies are loaded natively at runtime; however, dynamically loaded components are only loaded as they are specifically requested. While this can have a positive impact on performance, or grant additional functionality (for example, a non-invasive update feature), it can also open the application to loading unintended code if not implemented properly.\"", "datePublished": "2020-07-15T12:31:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T07:52:20", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0080800"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-4100"], "assigner": "HCL", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0635304b-bf77-3430-9477-4d12fd29df0d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
