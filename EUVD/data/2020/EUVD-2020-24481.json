The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific VDS-related CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user.", "datePublished": "2020-06-03T17:40:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:18:08", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cmd-inj-VfJtqGhE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3210"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b15a602d-13c8-3a0f-89ed-d3b1a30d1339", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 12.2(60)EZ16"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0ee59965-1d7c-3da6-937f-67648e69c184", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
