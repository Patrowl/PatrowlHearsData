Because the Bluetooth LE support is implemented without a requirement for pairing or security, any attacker can access the GATT server of the device and can sniff the data being broadcasted while a measurement is being done. Also, saved data can also be extracted over a Bluetooth connection. In addition, an attacker can launch a man-in-the-middle attack against data integrity.", "datePublished": "2020-08-26T15:14:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:15:20", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://payatu.com/advisory/lack-of-bluetooth-le-encryption-and-access-control-in-dr-trust-ecg-or-ekg-pen"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15486"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c5cc968f-7b65-38c5-bc7e-11babc0857ac", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3fdc6682-cd2f-35e8-a341-77d24ffa30bc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
