This does not directly lead to a security issue, yet it might aid attackers in their efforts to exploit other problems. The flaws unnecessarily make the servers more prone to Clickjacking, channel downgrade attacks and other similar client-based attack vectors.", "datePublished": "2020-04-06T13:04:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T06:46:30", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1728", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1728", "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-12264", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4252", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4213", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3539", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3501", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3497", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3496", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3495"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-1728", "GHSA-3gg7-9q2x-79fc"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7af0caa6-3eed-39a3-8afa-ad230d39e949", "product": {"name": "KeyCloak"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3187df44-79dc-37a1-a371-95074781b569", "vendor": {"name": "[UNKNOWN]"}}], "isExploited": false}
