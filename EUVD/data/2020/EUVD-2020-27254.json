A specially crafted pixel shader can cause memory corruption vulnerability. An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability potentially could be triggered from guest machines running virtualization environments (ie. VMware, qemu, VirtualBox etc.) in order to perform guest-to-host escape - as it was demonstrated before (TALOS-2018-0533, TALOS-2018-0568, etc.). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly). This vulnerability was triggered from HYPER-V guest using RemoteFX feature leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process).", "datePublished": "2020-07-20T20:22:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:47:41", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2020-1040"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6100"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "27f723bc-ff5b-30f1-af0b-be783366af41", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
