The vulnerability is due to improper checks on parameter values within affected pages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a crafted link that is designed to pass HTML code into an affected parameter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the contents of a web page to redirect the user to potentially malicious web sites, or the attacker could leverage this vulnerability to conduct further client-side attacks.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:21:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:54:58", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-html-BJ4Y9tX"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3345"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c5ad17e1-dad5-3b45-a7b6-b9f3b6a3f30c", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ddec29e3-d071-3745-a16a-666197b042a2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
