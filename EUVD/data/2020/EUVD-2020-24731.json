The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a request from a user and injecting malicious data into an HTTP header. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-07-31T00:00:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:18:29", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dcnm-xss-3jkDLsLV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3460"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "91ff00b5-c00f-30a4-8c54-b143bd668674", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Network Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16fec69f-17e1-3806-bad3-30fc1b6d213c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
