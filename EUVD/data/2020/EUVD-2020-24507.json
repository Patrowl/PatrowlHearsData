The attacker would need valid administrative credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of CLI command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using path traversal techniques when executing a vulnerable command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root shell access to the underlying operating system and overwrite or read arbitrary files on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:21:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:00:11", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nfvis-ptrav-SHMzzwVR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3236"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a9ad8912-afb5-3775-8a0a-a2874f1a939e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3f9b7a01-f3bc-3e61-967b-704588e0f420", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
