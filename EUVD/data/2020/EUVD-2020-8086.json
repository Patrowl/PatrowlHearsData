{"id": "EUVD-2020-8086", "enisaUuid": "a17db84c-df03-3967-bdb3-5b0e8ce4d697", "description": "Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up files in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user namespace, if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces were allowed. It was possible to have a file not readable by an unprivileged user to be copied to a mountpoint controlled by the user, like a removable device. This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef (\"ovl: stack file ops\"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9 (\"ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()\"), 48bd024 (\"ovl: switch to mounter creds in readdir\") and 05acefb (\"ovl: check permission to open real file\"). Additionally, commits 130fdbc (\"ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory\") and 292f902 (\"ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()\") in kernel 5.8 might also be desired or necessary. These additional commits introduced a regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces which prevented access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace. This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da (\"ovl: do not fail because of O_NOATIMEi\") in kernel 5.11.", "datePublished": "2021-02-10T19:45:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T18:49:11", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-16120.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-16120", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-16120", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-16120.html", "https://ubuntu.com/USN-4576-1", "https://ubuntu.com/USN-4577-1", "https://ubuntu.com/USN-4578-1", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/10/14/2", "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1894980", "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1900141", "https://git.kernel.org/linus/56230d956739b9cb1cbde439d76227d77979a04d", "https://git.kernel.org/linus/48bd024b8a40d73ad6b086de2615738da0c7004f", "https://git.kernel.org/linus/05acefb4872dae89e772729efb194af754c877e8", "https://git.kernel.org/linus/d1d04ef8572bc8c22265057bd3d5a79f223f8f52", "https://git.kernel.org/linus/b6650dab404c701d7fe08a108b746542a934da84"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-16120"], "assigner": "canonical", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "752d0951-38c8-3ba6-bdd0-da76aa546e91", "product": {"name": "Linux kernel"}, "product_version": "5.11-stable <5.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d88cdd59-667e-3c7b-b594-1d7971c1838c", "vendor": {"name": "Linux kernel"}}], "isExploited": false}
