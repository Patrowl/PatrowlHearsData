The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted arguments to specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS with the privileges of the currently logged-in user for all affected platforms excluding Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects. On Cisco UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, the injected commands are executed with root privileges.", "datePublished": "2020-02-26T16:50:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:38:05", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-fxos-ucs-cli-cmdinj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3171"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ecf4fd14-1fb2-3d11-a102-8fa037b96138", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "66d8955a-b101-3e39-9fa4-0c72875d5188", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
