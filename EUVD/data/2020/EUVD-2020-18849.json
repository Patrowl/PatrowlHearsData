In BookStack before version 0.30.5, a user with permissions to edit a page could set certain image URL's to manipulate functionality in the exporting system, which would allow them to make server side requests and/or have access to a wider scope of files within the BookStack file storage locations. The issue was addressed in BookStack v0.30.5. As a workaround, page edit permissions could be limited to only those that are trusted until you can upgrade.", "datePublished": "2020-12-09T16:20:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:04", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/security/advisories/GHSA-8wfc-w2r5-x7cr", "https://bookstackapp.com/blog/beta-release-v0-30-5/", "https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/releases/tag/v0.30.5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26260"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dc380e08-4364-3c24-801d-2906db274779", "product": {"name": "BookStack"}, "product_version": "v0.7, < v0.30.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cfa764bd-9cf5-3042-a6b0-417d24ba23ba", "vendor": {"name": "BookStackApp"}}], "isExploited": false}
