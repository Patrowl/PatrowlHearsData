The patch resets the depth to a proper size before throwing an exception. The memory leak can be triggered by a crafted input file that is processed by ImageMagick and could cause an impact to application reliability, such as denial of service. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.", "datePublished": "2020-12-08T21:57:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T16:18:45", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-27755.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-27755", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1894232"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-27755"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b58e6a6c-9d97-3398-ade7-370364b1f0ce", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
