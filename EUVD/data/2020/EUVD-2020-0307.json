However, it is found that the internal index can be forged by adding additional properties into user-input. If index is found in the query, taffyDB will ignore other query conditions and directly return the indexed data item. Moreover, the internal index is in an easily-guessable format (e.g., T000002R000001). As such, attackers can use this vulnerability to access any data items in the DB.", "datePublished": "2020-02-17T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:32:01", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10790", "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFY-546521", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/taffy", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/taffydb", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TAFFYDB-2992450"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-10790", "GHSA-mxhp-79qh-mcx6"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d29f545a-04a3-32d3-b2cd-b6719fde3f0d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
