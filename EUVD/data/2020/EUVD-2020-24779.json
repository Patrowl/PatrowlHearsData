The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when an affected device has reached platform limitations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious series of IP ARP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources, which would eventually cause the affected device to reload.", "datePublished": "2020-09-24T17:51:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:00:09", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esp20-arp-dos-GvHVggqJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3508"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e597e00b-0425-3d5e-8c57-ec2b7af9a1c4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b79294ba-72e4-34d2-b9a0-01f1dcabe3a8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
