The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks.", "datePublished": "2020-09-04T02:25:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:08:42", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-jabber-G3NSjPn7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3537"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9c8c324-fed2-39e8-8be2-050f5af65c03", "product": {"name": "Cisco Jabber"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "47dd272e-0878-3e6b-b8c5-e109d5182171", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
