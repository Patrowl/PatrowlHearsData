The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.", "datePublished": "2020-08-17T18:00:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:16:15", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr5k-ipv6-dos-ce3zhF8m"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3500"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "be078405-d98e-3014-922a-3440f8d095fb", "product": {"name": "Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4683004-c819-3faa-97a5-c80d0d240107", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
