RPAs that have been associated with a specific remote device may also be used to identify a peer in the same manner by using its reaction to an active scan request. This has also been called an allowlist-based side channel.", "datePublished": "2022-11-08T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T17:02:08", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3559372", "https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2022/proceedings/ccs-proceedings.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-35473"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fd8e15a6-732a-32d8-b891-811ecaa43882", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6a74aacf-cf51-3503-8d9d-88fd1122b7f4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
