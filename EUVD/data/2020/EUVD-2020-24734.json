The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-08-17T18:00:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:15:48", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-mttngs-xss-3VbdxDuF"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3463"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "026f8316-6937-3db7-a432-baf3923f059a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d57429cc-4768-329b-b01c-6bc5edbc38d0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
