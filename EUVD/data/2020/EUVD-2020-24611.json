These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.", "datePublished": "2020-07-02T04:20:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:57:38", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-mlt-ise-strd-xss-nqFhTtx7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3340"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6768611d-5b93-3c73-ac04-8f2eb66ef1be", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c8302b50-faea-3834-85a6-67bec25f2b58", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
