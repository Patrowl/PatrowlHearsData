The vulnerability is due to inefficient memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of crafted HTTP requests to the affected web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and could result in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-07-16T17:21:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T16:53:24", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-emvman-3y6LuTcZ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3372"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b4183c0d-8076-3049-b8eb-0a05e87e0960", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1331bb34-97da-3f09-bded-95b5837046c8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
