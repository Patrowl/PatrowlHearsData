The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2020-06-18T02:15:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:08:19", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-routers-stack-vUxHmnNz"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-3291"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c8c1fd54-ae3f-33a6-b5f5-bba425581f92", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9fedaf7-3d3b-3f36-8823-dc81c4640e44", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
