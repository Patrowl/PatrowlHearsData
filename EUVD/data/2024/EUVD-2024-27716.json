This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with access to the Fluent Forms settings, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This can be chained with CVE-2024-2771 for a low-privileged user to inject malicious web scripts.", "datePublished": "2024-05-18T07:38:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T19:25:41", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2ccba77c-fb90-4906-b0fe-77607ec5df1f?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3073857"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-2772"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bbb5d593-307e-35d8-99ec-fdec55fc77e1", "product": {"name": "Contact Form Plugin by Fluent Forms for Quiz, Survey, and Drag & Drop WP Form Builder"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.1.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b19ee669-9208-3e2d-9e5f-37d0de7b6685", "vendor": {"name": "techjewel"}}], "isExploited": false}
