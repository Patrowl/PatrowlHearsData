Versions of step-security/harden-runner prior to v2.10.2 contain multiple command injection weaknesses via environment variables that could potentially be exploited under specific conditions. However, due to the current execution order of pre-steps in GitHub Actions and the placement of harden-runner as the first step in a job, the likelihood of exploitation is low as the Harden-Runner action reads the environment variable during the pre-step stage. There are no known exploits at this time. Version 2.10.2 contains a patch.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T22:03:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T14:38:08", "baseScore": 2.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/security/advisories/GHSA-g85v-wf27-67xc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52587", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/commit/0080882f6c36860b6ba35c610c98ce87d4e2f26f", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L40-L44", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L53", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L57", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/arc-runner.ts#L61", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/setup.ts#L169", "https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/951b48540b429070694bc8abd82fd6901eb123ca/src/setup.ts#L229"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52587", "GHSA-g85v-wf27-67xc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d0e74383-f105-358d-9be1-bffa188d21ff", "product": {"name": "harden-runner"}, "product_version": "< 2.10.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "acd832fd-0570-3d51-9b88-6b62ee9e53cc", "vendor": {"name": "step-security"}}], "isExploited": false}
