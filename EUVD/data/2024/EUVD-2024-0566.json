When Bref is used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a `RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files` or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the difference in the body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or undefined behaviors. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.", "datePublished": "2024-02-01T16:10:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T23:28:11", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/brefphp/bref/security/advisories/GHSA-82vx-mm6r-gg8w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24754", "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/commit/c77d9f5abf021f29fa96b5720b7b84adbd199092", "https://github.com/brefphp/bref", "https://github.com/brefphp/bref/blob/2.1.12/src/Event/Http/Psr7Bridge.php#L130-L168"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24754", "GHSA-82vx-mm6r-gg8w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69dd6763-2146-380e-a996-70af073e6f96", "product": {"name": "bref"}}, {"id": "c8b1535d-34ea-3075-80ba-42298e3b87c0", "product": {"name": "bref"}, "product_version": "< 2.1.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac812d7f-7ced-3b7a-9a87-61206ba889e4", "vendor": {"name": "brefphp"}}], "isExploited": false}
