By manipulating a DOM element through a crafted URL or user input, the high-privileged attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim would need to visit a malicious link or input data into a compromised form. A successful attacker can abuse this to achieve session takeover, increasing the confidentiality and integrity impact as high.", "datePublished": "2024-12-10T20:42:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-16T17:33:20", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/connect/apsb24-99.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-54037"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 8.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4db3da42-dc6f-3988-bb82-3e0051fd7a87", "product": {"name": "Adobe Connect"}, "product_version": "0 \u226411.4.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26d4175e-e152-35c9-8b70-e605808234db", "vendor": {"name": "Adobe"}}], "isExploited": false}
