This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.", "datePublished": "2024-03-07T05:32:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:48:21", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/62b809dc-4089-4822-8aeb-7049fcfe376e?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-registration/trunk/includes/class-ur-shortcodes.php#L288", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3045419/user-registration/trunk/includes/class-ur-shortcodes.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1720"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "06977a77-09a8-364d-9676-7464e9afb795", "product": {"name": "User Registration \u2013 Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin"}}, {"id": "4f43c12f-1ae5-3d10-aa51-289c20b8548e", "product": {"name": "User Registration \u2013 Custom Registration Form, Login Form, and User Profile WordPress Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.1.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "48c0cd4a-ba29-362b-ac6e-710e83e1f24e", "vendor": {"name": "WPEverest"}}], "isExploited": false}
