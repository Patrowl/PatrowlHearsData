This endpoint does not verify that the user has the necessary access rights to the run(s) they are accessing. As a result, it returns not only the specified run but also all runs that have the `run_id` listed as their parent run. This issue affects the main branch, commit a761d833. The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to obtain information about non-public runs and their related runs, given the `run_id` of a public or non-public run.", "datePublished": "2024-09-13T16:13:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-13T16:38:51", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6867", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/35afd4439464571eb016318cd7b6f85a162225ca", "https://huntr.com/bounties/460df515-164c-4435-954b-0233a181545f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6867", "GHSA-9jmp-j63g-8x6m"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1145c758-30b5-38f0-99f0-9be3863a544b", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.4.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6868ba0c-ee73-37fd-bf58-d31d6163519f", "vendor": {"name": "lunary-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
