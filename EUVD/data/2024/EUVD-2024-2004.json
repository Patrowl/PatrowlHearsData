Affected versions of the nano-id crate incorrectly generated IDs using a reduced character set in the `nano_id::base62` and `nano_id::base58` functions. Specifically, the `base62` function used a character set of 32 symbols instead of the intended 62 symbols, and the `base58` function used a character set of 16 symbols instead of the intended 58 symbols. Additionally, the `nano_id::gen` macro is also affected when a custom character set that is not a power of 2 in size is specified. It should be noted that `nano_id::base64` is not affected by this vulnerability. This can result in a significant reduction in entropy, making the generated IDs predictable and vulnerable to brute-force attacks when the IDs are used in security-sensitive contexts such as session tokens or unique identifiers. The vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.0.", "datePublished": "2024-06-04T14:11:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:37:05", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/security/advisories/GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36400", "https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id/commit/a9022772b2f1ce38929b5b81eccc670ac9d3ab23", "https://github.com/viz-rs/nano-id", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0343.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-36400", "GHSA-9hc7-6w9r-wj94"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72d36364-a0a4-3a13-a99e-89998d54c7e5", "product": {"name": "nano-id"}, "product_version": "< 0.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7a0de492-7c3d-3dfe-a5bc-fed3cd5809af", "vendor": {"name": "viz-rs"}}], "isExploited": false}
