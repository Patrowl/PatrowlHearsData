Sites building with Tina CMS's command line interface (CLI) prior to version 1.6.2 that use a search token may be vulnerable to the search token being leaked via lock file (tina-lock.json). Administrators of Tina-enabled websites with search setup should rotate their key immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli version 1.6.2. Upgrading and rotating the search token is required for the proper fix.", "datePublished": "2024-09-03T19:43:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T20:23:59", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/security/advisories/GHSA-4qrm-9h4r-v2fx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45391", "https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/pull/4758", "https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms/commit/110f1ceea4574d636a64526648f7c8bf6539b26a", "https://github.com/tinacms/tinacms"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45391", "GHSA-4qrm-9h4r-v2fx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "18cb5be5-61c4-3b8a-b295-001b965a2693", "product": {"name": "tinacms"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a1bf59c7-5395-35a7-b41e-4b889f852dd4", "vendor": {"name": "tinacms"}}], "isExploited": false}
