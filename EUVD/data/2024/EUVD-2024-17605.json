The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the `_speech` method of the MacOSTTS class. Specifically, the use of `os.system` to execute the `say` command with user-supplied text allows for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can inject shell commands. This issue is triggered when the AutoGPT instance is run with the `--speak` option enabled and configured with `TEXT_TO_SPEECH_PROVIDER=macos`, reflecting back a shell injection snippet. The impact of this vulnerability is the potential execution of arbitrary code on the instance running AutoGPT. The issue was addressed in version 5.1.0.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T18:39:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:56:22", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/4e742624-8771-4f3c-9634-3eaf33d6d58e", "https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/26324f29849967fa72c207da929af612f1740669"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1880"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "01a1e554-babe-3349-9da7-d5aa71127c00", "product": {"name": "significant-gravitas/autogpt"}, "product_version": "unspecified <5.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b437d4ca-0837-3b12-9368-0b89b1544160", "vendor": {"name": "Significant-Gravitas"}}], "isExploited": false}
