This is due to a numerical logic flaw when transferring funds to another user. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to create funds during a transfer and distribute these funds to any number of other users or their own account, rendering products free. Attackers could also request to withdraw funds if the Wallet Withdrawal extension is used and the request is approved by an administrator.", "datePublished": "2024-11-28T12:54:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-29T16:36:15", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fd8f3eb7-ac60-46c4-b41f-5d89e3133042?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-wallet/trunk/includes/class-woo-wallet-frontend.php#L407", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3145131/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7747"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e3376fa7-b671-3a54-993b-af1facb7d7f1", "product": {"name": "Wallet for WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.5.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3b59610-a9dd-3b99-8e02-4cebf48b22b6", "vendor": {"name": "subratamal"}}], "isExploited": false}
