This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This functionality is also vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. The Cross-Site Scripting was patched in version 5.16.7.1, while the arbitrary shortcode execution was patched in 5.16.7.2.", "datePublished": "2024-12-13T08:24:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-16T16:41:47", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/66b669ce-142a-48b8-9adf-620657c2db74?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-coupon-usage/tags/5.16.7/inc/functions/functions-user-coupons.php#L491", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3207070%40woo-coupon-usage&new=3207070%40woo-coupon-usage&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12421"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4e992f3f-9716-3782-8b12-3b2ba52b45b4", "product": {"name": "Coupon Affiliates \u2013 Affiliate Plugin for WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.16.7.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "861ac186-ef6d-3e5b-ab45-7674034f0354", "vendor": {"name": "elliotvs"}}], "isExploited": false}
