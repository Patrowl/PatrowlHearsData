All details of GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w are relevant to `pyrage` for the versions specified in this advisory. See GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w for full details. Versions of `pyrage` before 1.2.0 lack plugin support and are therefore **not affected**. An equivalent issue was fixed in [the reference Go implementation of age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), see advisory GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.3 and all users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-12-19T22:24:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-20T17:32:22", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/security/advisories/GHSA-32gq-x56h-299c", "https://github.com/str4d/rage/security/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w", "https://github.com/woodruffw/pyrage/security/advisories/GHSA-47h8-jmp3-9f28", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56327", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4fg7-vxc8-qx5w", "https://github.com/woodruffw/pyrage"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56327", "GHSA-47h8-jmp3-9f28"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1c3c1216-c5b5-3f67-9f76-a0a6e8408a3f", "product": {"name": "pyrage"}, "product_version": "1.2.0, < 1.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "850ab96d-444d-35fa-a331-3c68b3839971", "vendor": {"name": "woodruffw"}}], "isExploited": false}
