{"id": "EUVD-2024-35248", "enisaUuid": "43b19ea6-9cad-3125-ac26-54bf27dda105", "description": "OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions \"Edit work packages\" as well as \"Add attachments\". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.\n", "datePublished": "2024-05-23T12:53:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:07:46", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/opf/openproject/security/advisories/GHSA-h26c-j8wg-frjc", "https://community.openproject.org/projects/openproject/work_packages/55198/relations"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-35224"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81270292-ee00-300b-9f94-55cb5bd86260", "product": {"name": "openproject"}, "product_version": "14.0.0, < 14.0.2"}, {"id": "dde0d200-59e8-3ac0-83e0-a10f4526f010", "product": {"name": "openproject"}, "product_version": "13.4.0, < 13.4.2"}, {"id": "fd5d988c-e945-3845-88cf-886da745dcb5", "product": {"name": "openproject"}, "product_version": "< 14.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dfb95363-c16c-3e87-9228-9d94fe4ebdd9", "vendor": {"name": "opf"}}], "isExploited": false}
