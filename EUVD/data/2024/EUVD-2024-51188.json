This is due to the pms_pb_payment_redirect_link function using the user-controlled value supplied via the 'pms_payment_id' parameter to authenticate users without any further identity validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with knowledge of a valid payment ID to log in as any user who has made a purchase on the targeted site.", "datePublished": "2025-01-14T09:21:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-14T14:43:35", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d3a4fa4d-a7d2-4890-b0f5-5fe69bc5e7ac?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3214706/paid-member-subscriptions"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12919"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7f8a71ec-677f-302c-b452-d0c7bc215742", "product": {"name": "Paid Membership Subscriptions \u2013 Effortless Memberships, Recurring Payments & Content Restriction"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.13.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e0b39429-d806-340c-b567-f62208f964ed", "vendor": {"name": "madalinungureanu"}}], "isExploited": false}
