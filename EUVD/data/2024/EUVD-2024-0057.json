An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-02-13T01:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-23T03:00:00", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-g9xm-7538-mq8w", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24826", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/exiv2/PYSEC-2024-106.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24826", "GHSA-g9xm-7538-mq8w", "PYSEC-2024-106"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b13f88d-53c6-3686-8057-0b53cb638fe3", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}}, {"id": "306d5715-0e3b-33af-ac27-40140c2b8b71", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "0.28.0, < 0.28.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a5f8e6e-6aef-3575-9267-b95cec74f038", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
