The vulnerability CVE-2023-49090 wasn't fully addressed. This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when uploading to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to set a Content-Type value that is interpreted by browsers to be different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`, by providing multiple values separated by commas. This bypassed value can be used to cause XSS. Upgrade to 3.0.7 or 2.2.6.\n", "datePublished": "2024-03-24T19:27:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:03:51", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/security/advisories/GHSA-vfmv-jfc5-pjjw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29034", "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/commit/25b1c800d45ef8e78dc445ebe3bd8a6e3f0a3477", "https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/carrierwave/CVE-2024-29034.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-29034", "GHSA-vfmv-jfc5-pjjw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d2d9be3f-3e3d-3ef4-8e6f-035e3d9b69e6", "product": {"name": "carrierwave"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.0.7"}, {"id": "f3d6ed2a-690f-3770-b618-2cfb04236220", "product": {"name": "carrierwave"}, "product_version": "< 2.2.6"}, {"id": "f83fe831-e3d9-3706-8145-cde80fe57b9f", "product": {"name": "carrierwave"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f0fee285-306f-3894-af9f-c9a10cf81b0c", "vendor": {"name": "carrierwaveuploader"}}], "isExploited": false}
