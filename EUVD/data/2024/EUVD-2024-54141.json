This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-03-07T08:21:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-07T17:32:46", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/31093664-c45e-4e87-b72f-5cdf8e8e9f67?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/jobcareer-job-board-responsive-wordpress-theme/14221636"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12035"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "21434081-cad4-3ce7-8991-9055fc107e74", "product": {"name": "CS Framework"}, "product_version": "* \u22647.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ded9128a-eff9-3f83-a75c-dd1a2275253a", "vendor": {"name": "Chimpstudio"}}], "isExploited": false}
