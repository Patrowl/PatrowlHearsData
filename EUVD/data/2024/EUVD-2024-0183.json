In versions 0.3.10 and prior, using the `slice` builtin can result in a double eval vulnerability when the buffer argument is either `msg.data`, `self.code` or `<address>.code` and either the `start` or `length` arguments have side-effects. It can be easily triggered only with the versions `<0.3.4` as `0.3.4` introduced the unique symbol fence. No vulnerable production contracts were found. Additionally, double evaluation of side-effects should be easily discoverable in client tests. As such, the impact is low. As of time of publication, no fixed versions are available.\\n\\n", "datePublished": "2024-04-25T09:15:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-19T09:19:01", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-r56x-j438-vw5m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32646", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2914", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/vyper/PYSEC-2024-207.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32646", "PYSEC-2024-207"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d566a703-c72d-3bab-8f24-cc7df713b74e", "product": {"name": "vyper"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.3.10"}, {"id": "fef7c7fe-6e79-3921-bbe9-ad7f7618ab6a", "product": {"name": "vyper"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f938c6ba-346d-36ac-aadf-121ee237fe79", "vendor": {"name": "vyperlang"}}], "isExploited": false}
