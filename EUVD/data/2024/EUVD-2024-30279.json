{"id": "EUVD-2024-30279", "enisaUuid": "3d3f04d2-d267-39fe-803c-31c5b0f339bf", "description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. in versions before 1.10.9, 1.12.9, 1.14.6, and 1.15.8, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app could execute arbitrary code outside its sandbox. Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6.", "datePublished": "2024-04-18T18:11:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-16T18:13:22", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-phv6-cpc2-2fgj", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/72016e3fce8fcbeab707daf4f1a02b931fcc004d", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/81abe2a37d363f5099c3d0bdcd0caad6efc5bf97", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/b7c1a558e58aaeb1d007d29529bbb270dc4ff11e", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/bbab7ed1e672356d1a78b422462b210e8e875931", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZFNSCFJVMAQK5AF55JBN7OSJP3CREDBD/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IB6VQAF5S2YOBULDHPUKPOEIKONOP5KO/", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/18/5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32462"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58e56943-ce23-3c0d-b578-a71a21f6d425", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}}, {"id": "6edeae78-40e1-3da3-b746-758aa3b6e4eb", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.14.0, < 1.14.6"}, {"id": "78a3ab8b-11b9-362e-891b-4e18922480fc", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.9"}, {"id": "a2972490-6f97-3148-847b-d1662290c56e", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.15.0, < 1.15.8"}, {"id": "d3f43f74-c8ac-333f-883d-a0df2d2ccabe", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.12.0, < 1.12.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "58e56943-ce23-3c0d-b578-a71a21f6d425", "vendor": {"name": "flatpak"}}], "isExploited": false}
