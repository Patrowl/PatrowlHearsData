A user on Appsmith that doesn't have admin permissions can trigger the restart API on Appsmith, causing a server restart. This is still within the Appsmith container, and the impact is limited to Appsmith's own server only, but there is a denial of service because it can be continually restarted. This is due to incorrect access control checks, which should check for super user permissions on the incoming request.", "datePublished": "2025-03-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-27T13:36:32", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-6mc8-hw5c-7qqr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55963"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 24.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "48c5f797-745e-334f-9c01-048166d68430", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36575450-d38b-30f9-903b-27f1eeefc4d4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
