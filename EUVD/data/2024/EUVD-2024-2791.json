An attacker can exploit this flaw by keeping a TCP connection open indefinitely, causing the server to become unresponsive and resulting in other DNS queries timing out. This issue prevents legitimate users from accessing DNS services, thereby disrupting normal operations and causing service downtime.", "datePublished": "2024-09-04T14:24:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T20:57:31", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8418", "https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/issues/500", "https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/pull/503", "https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns/commit/aa109bbd6743abd7027e589cc4b871dd2dce7d50", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-8418", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2309683", "https://github.com/containers/aardvark-dns", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:7094"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8418", "GHSA-g5jh-57wm-p79m"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "894c211c-aa75-3db4-89a9-1485d0209dc3", "product": {"name": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"}, "product_version": "patch: 2:1.14.0-1.el9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "54663d33-6114-31e4-b06c-86fc74cbca02", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
