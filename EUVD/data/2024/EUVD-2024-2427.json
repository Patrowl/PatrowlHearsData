Input of the `ImageId` in the code is not sanitized and may lead to path traversal. This allows an attacker to store an image in an arbitrary location that the server has permission to access. This issue has been addressed in version 2.1.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "datePublished": "2024-07-15T19:53:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:33:11", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/security/advisories/GHSA-vvmv-wrvp-9gjr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39918", "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/commit/e4eaeca6493b21cd515b582fd6c0af09ede54507", "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png", "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/blob/e43098e0af3a380ebc044e7f303a83933b94b434/src/middlewares/extract_query_params.ts#L75", "https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/releases/tag/v2.1.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39918", "GHSA-vvmv-wrvp-9gjr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8e3b9fc1-a0e7-3e12-9024-12da2e177073", "product": {"name": "url-to-png"}, "product_version": "< 2.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9cad1f35-b109-37e3-bb1c-1408efced162", "vendor": {"name": "jasonraimondi"}}], "isExploited": false}
