This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2024-11-13T03:20:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T16:18:19", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a1c6eed6-7b3f-4b37-85f8-6613527daa54?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-order-export-lite/trunk/classes/core/trait-woe-core-extractor.php#L996", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-order-export-lite/trunk/classes/PHPExcel/Shared/XMLWriter.php#L83"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-10828"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 38.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d332b626-5f30-3457-b63c-e99169ea1a39", "product": {"name": "Advanced Order Export For WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.5.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36d23093-cd2b-3304-831e-d61f3d29c8fd", "vendor": {"name": "AlgolPlus"}}], "isExploited": false}
