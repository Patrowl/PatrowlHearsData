These tokens, intended for sensitive operations such as password resets or account verification, are exposed to unauthorized actors, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user. This issue was addressed in version 1.2.6, where the exposure of single-use tokens in user-facing queries was mitigated.", "datePublished": "2024-11-14T17:34:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-30T13:09:20", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/8fdfdb9d-10bd-4f00-8004-d5baabc20c6e", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/17e95f6c99c7d5ac4ee5451c5857b97a12892c74"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3501"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c07e43bb-f566-3e0d-a3f5-9ca7eab313ae", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.2.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e5e84fee-3945-3e00-b458-6987e2098ac2", "vendor": {"name": "lunary-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
