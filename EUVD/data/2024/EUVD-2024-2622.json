Prior to versions 6.6.5.1 and 6.5.8.13, the Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the `aggregations` object. The `name` field in this `aggregations` object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using SQL parameters. Update to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13 to receive a patch. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin.", "datePublished": "2024-08-08T14:55:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-08T18:33:33", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p6w9-r443-r752", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42357", "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/63c05615694790f5790a04ef889f42b764fa53c9", "https://github.com/shopware/core/commit/a784aa1cec0624e36e0ee4d41aeebaed40e0442f", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/57ea2f3c59483cf7c0f853e7a0d68c23ded1fe5b", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/8504ba7e56e53add6a1d5b9d45015e3d899cd0ac", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-42357", "GHSA-p6w9-r443-r752"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "180f85ad-bb15-3b0c-bb74-b966751d8a3d", "product": {"name": "shopware"}, "product_version": "6.6.0.0, \u2264 6.6.5.0"}, {"id": "9e31da69-d033-36df-bcd6-964669aad2be", "product": {"name": "shopware"}, "product_version": "\u2264 6.5.8.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a1e221bb-ede5-3587-996c-52deae842452", "vendor": {"name": "shopware"}}], "isExploited": false}
