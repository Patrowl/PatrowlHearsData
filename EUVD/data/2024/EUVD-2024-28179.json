A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix. There are no known workarounds beyond updating the library.", "datePublished": "2024-04-04T18:42:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-21T14:30:49", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Network/security/advisories/GHSA-6h3m-c6fv-8hvh"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-30249"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17d541de-cb96-3457-b6b7-fa52f2398a40", "product": {"name": "network"}}, {"id": "71c97e73-ae6c-3a21-9e13-4a107684db97", "product": {"name": "network"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2eacd523-40af-38c1-ab03-220ebd12960a", "vendor": {"name": "CloudburstMC"}}], "isExploited": false}
