A command injection vulnerability on the 1.3.x DEV branch allows any unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary command on the server when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. In `cmd_realtime.php` line 119, the `$poller_id` used as part of the command execution is sourced from `$_SERVER['argv']`, which can be controlled by URL when `register_argc_argv` option of PHP is `On`. And this option is `On` by default in many environments such as the main PHP Docker image for PHP. Commit 53e8014d1f082034e0646edc6286cde3800c683d contains a patch for the issue, but this commit was reverted in commit 99633903cad0de5ace636249de16f77e57a3c8fc.", "datePublished": "2024-05-13T14:33:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:17:58", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cr28-x256-xf5m", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/53e8014d1f082034e0646edc6286cde3800c683d", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/commit/99633903cad0de5ace636249de16f77e57a3c8fc", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/501712998589763d411a68d35e3cda98fd9cfd18/cmd_realtime.php#L119"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-29895"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 93.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8dc326e6-d0bf-3af1-961f-ba134d7628b9", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "= 1.3.x DEV"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f24a0775-41a0-3dfd-b81e-bf51a218b8d3", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
