{"id": "EUVD-2024-1788", "enisaUuid": "e45e3dfb-403a-35b0-9235-dfdae41b85be", "description": "The source-controller is a Kubernetes operator, specialised in artifacts acquisition from external sources such as Git, OCI, Helm repositories and S3-compatible buckets. The source-controller implements the source.toolkit.fluxcd.io API and is a core component of the GitOps toolkit. Prior to version 1.2.5, when source-controller was configured to use an Azure SAS token when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires. This vulnerability was fixed in source-controller v1.2.5. There is no workaround for this vulnerability except for using a different auth mechanism such as Azure Workload Identity.", "datePublished": "2024-05-15T15:52:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:46:04", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/security/advisories/GHSA-v554-xwgw-hc3w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31216", "https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/pull/1430", "https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/commit/915d1a072a4f37dd460ba33079dc094aa6e72fa9", "https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-31216", "GHSA-v554-xwgw-hc3w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1eecb855-880a-3190-b196-a784f2673083", "product": {"name": "source-controller"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "68496bb9-ebc6-3632-84a9-603cbf039cfd", "vendor": {"name": "fluxcd"}}], "isExploited": false}
