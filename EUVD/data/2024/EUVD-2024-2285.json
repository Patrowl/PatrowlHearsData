Prior to the fixed versions,\u00a0`yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` do not limit the extensions of downloaded files, which could lead to arbitrary filenames being created in the download folder (and path traversal on Windows). Since `yt-dlp` and `youtube-dl` also read config from the working directory (and on Windows executables will be executed from the `yt-dlp` or `youtube-dl` directory), this could lead to arbitrary code being executed.\n\n\n\n\n`yt-dlp` version 2024.07.01 fixes this issue by whitelisting the allowed extensions. `youtube-dl` fixes this issue in commit `d42a222` on the `master` branch and in nightly builds tagged 2024-07-03 or later. This might mean some very uncommon extensions might not get downloaded, however it will also limit the possible exploitation surface. In addition to upgrading, have `.%(ext)s` at the end of the output template and make sure the user trusts the websites that they are downloading from. Also, make sure to never download to a directory within PATH or other sensitive locations like one's user directory, `system32`, or other binaries locations. For users who are not able to upgrade, keep the default output template (`-o \"%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`); make sure the extension of the media to download is a common video/audio/sub/... one; try to avoid the generic extractor; and/or use `--ignore-config --config-location ...` to not load config from common locations.", "datePublished": "2024-07-02T13:47:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:12:25", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/dirkf/youtube-dl/security/advisories/GHSA-22fp-mf44-f2mq", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38519", "https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/pull/32830", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/5ce582448ececb8d9c30c8c31f58330090ced03a", "https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/commit/d42a222ed541b96649396ef00e19552aef0f09ec", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2024.07.01", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-089_youtube-dl", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-090_yt-dlp", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-089_youtube-dl/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-38519", "GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "73848d21-3474-3d52-beef-a17c74aee804", "product": {"name": "youtube-dl"}, "product_version": "2015.01.25 \u22642021.12.17"}, {"id": "ce82e8e4-0cd8-35e7-a4cb-bee18e48b04c", "product": {"name": "youtube-dl"}, "product_version": "nightly <2024-07-03"}, {"id": "d4193d19-c9b2-38a6-8bd1-d29c628f54e5", "product": {"name": "yt-dlp"}, "product_version": "< 2024.07.01 <2024.07.01"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "480ea08f-aaa4-3983-8201-33a33b370264", "vendor": {"name": "yt-dlp"}}, {"id": "8608f74f-0cd4-39d8-a3a0-2462ebbc1fbb", "vendor": {"name": "ytdl-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
