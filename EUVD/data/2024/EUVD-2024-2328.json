{"id": "EUVD-2024-2328", "enisaUuid": "1c9a5cd2-c22a-3c56-a971-ce97005c9b41", "description": "Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. `fides.js`, a client-side script used to interact with the consent management features of Fides, used the `polyfill.io` domain in a very limited edge case, when it detected a legacy browser such as IE11 that did not support the fetch standard. Therefore it was possible for users of legacy, pre-2017 browsers who navigate to a page serving `fides.js` to download and execute malicious scripts from the `polyfill.io` domain when the domain was compromised and serving malware. No exploitation of `fides.js` via `polyfill.io` has been identified as of time of publication.\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. On Thursday, June 27, 2024, Cloudflare and Namecheap intervened at a domain level to ensure `polyfill.io` and its subdomains could not resolve to the compromised service, rendering this vulnerability unexploitable. Prior to the domain level intervention, there were no server-side workarounds and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts of this vulnerability were high. Clients could ensure they were not affected by using a modern browser that supported the fetch standard.", "datePublished": "2024-07-02T19:50:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:12:24", "baseScore": 0.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-cvw4-c69g-7v7m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38537", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/5026", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/868c4d629760572192bd61db34f5a4458ed12005", "https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides", "https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-38537", "GHSA-cvw4-c69g-7v7m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 22.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89c20b91-b944-358e-9070-182e8fac7a12", "product": {"name": "fides"}, "product_version": "< 2.39.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4b1afd7d-fba2-359f-b97b-26c224bed1ba", "vendor": {"name": "ethyca"}}], "isExploited": false}
