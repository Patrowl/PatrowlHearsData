There is a vulnerability in version 3.0.1 where CAs can view or edit the grade for any submission ID, even if they are not a CA for the class that has the submission. The endpoints only check that the CAs have the authorization level of a CA in the class in the endpoint, which is not necessarily the class the submission is attached to. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T20:43:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T14:54:45", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-rjg4-cf66-x6gr", "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/96006d532a392eeca2d350d1811f8e8ab9625bda"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52584"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "67a3f2b6-bf6a-310b-b17c-19fe6261f246", "product": {"name": "Autolab"}, "product_version": "= 3.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a04eb7a6-4e88-3fd8-a6d6-f1a4c4ddf928", "vendor": {"name": "autolab"}}], "isExploited": false}
