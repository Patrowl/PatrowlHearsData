In versions up to and including 1.0.1, MD5 is used to hash passwords before sending them to the backend. MD5 is a cryptographically broken hashing algorithm and is no longer considered secure for password storage or transmission. It is vulnerable to collision attacks and can be easily cracked using modern hardware, exposing user credentials to potential compromise. As of time of publication, a replacement for MD5 has not been committed to the free-one-api GitHub repository.", "datePublished": "2024-12-30T16:19:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-30T16:48:21", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/RockChinQ/free-one-api/security/advisories/GHSA-36cc-58vm-wm4h", "https://github.com/RockChinQ/free-one-api/blob/4d6ee42ffbb224b95be32c26cabc28d54d01bf78/web/src/main.js#L15"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56516"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dd1a516a-d215-300c-963e-ba9280a280bd", "product": {"name": "free-one-api"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "79a2448c-6d58-34d3-9cf7-34faf6bd9f48", "vendor": {"name": "RockChinQ"}}], "isExploited": false}
