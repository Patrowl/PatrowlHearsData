A vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 allows bypassing password login by adding X-Forwarded-For header with an unparsable IP address, e.g. `a`. This results in a possibility of logging into any account with a known login or email address. The vulnerability requires the authentik instance to trust X-Forwarded-For header provided by the attacker, thus it is not reproducible from external hosts on a properly configured environment.  The issue occurs due to the password stage having a policy bound to it, which skips the password stage if the Identification stage is setup to also contain a password stage. Due to the invalid X-Forwarded-For header, which does not get validated to be an IP Address early enough, the exception happens later and the policy fails. The default blueprint doesn't correctly set `failure_result` to `True` on the policy binding meaning that due to this exception the policy returns false and the password stage is skipped. Versions 2024.8.3 and 2024.6.5 fix this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-09-27T15:18:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-27T17:55:55", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/security/advisories/GHSA-7jxf-mmg9-9hg7", "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/78f7b04d5a62b2a9d4316282a713c2c7857dbe29", "https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/commit/dd8f809161e738b25765797eb2a5c77a7d3fc2cf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47070"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66c0f826-c9fc-36c9-822b-74383ae90f6f", "product": {"name": "authentik"}, "product_version": "< 2024.6.5"}, {"id": "b4c4f531-cdbc-372b-bd17-4aa40727d4e1", "product": {"name": "authentik"}, "product_version": "2024.8.0-rc1, < 2024.8.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8bb751e2-e217-33e9-a1b7-7e1127879745", "vendor": {"name": "goauthentik"}}], "isExploited": false}
