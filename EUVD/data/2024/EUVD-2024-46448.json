This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DOS) by shutting down the server through sending invalid upload requests. Specifically, the server can be made to shut down by sending an empty body with a 'Content-Length: 0' header or by sending a body with arbitrary content, such as 'asdasdasd', with a 'Content-Length: 9' header. The vulnerability is reproducible by users with at least a 'Manager' role, sending a crafted request to any workspace. This issue indicates that a previous fix was not effective in mitigating the vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-06-19T06:13:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T12:49:42", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/6c8bdfa1-ec56-4b02-bde9-cfc27470e6ca", "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/e2439c6d4c3cfdacd96cd1b7b92d1f89c3cc8459"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5208"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c05e3ffd-7163-3b3f-bf29-8d29d5123d3e", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ccb02428-d972-30e8-9f74-b5fc988f08b8", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
