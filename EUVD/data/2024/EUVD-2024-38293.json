Prior to 3.18.1, a code execution vulnerability existed in VNote, which allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary programs on the victim's system. A crafted URI can be used in a note to perform this attack using file:/// as a link. For example, file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs by embedding a reference to a local executable file such as file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/cmd.exe and file:///C:/WINDOWS/system32/calc.exe. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating and sharing specially crafted notes. An attacker could send a crafted note file and perform further attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.18.1.", "datePublished": "2024-07-11T15:37:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:33:11", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/security/advisories/GHSA-vhh5-8wcv-68gj", "https://github.com/vnotex/vnote/commit/3477469b669708ff547037fda9fc2817870428aa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39904"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b41733fc-196f-36cb-9173-346201a453eb", "product": {"name": "vnote"}, "product_version": "< 3.18.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67b79acc-7a2b-323a-9bf7-7a1c7ca80aa6", "vendor": {"name": "vnotex"}}], "isExploited": false}
