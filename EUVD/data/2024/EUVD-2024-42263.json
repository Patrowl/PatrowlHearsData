The `cfGetPrinterAttributes5` function in `libcupsfilters` does not sanitize IPP attributes returned from an IPP server. When these IPP attributes are used, for instance, to generate a PPD file, this can lead to attacker controlled data to be provided to the rest of the CUPS system.", "datePublished": "2024-09-26T21:18:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T22:19:59", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-w63j-6g73-wmg5", "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-browsed/security/advisories/GHSA-rj88-6mr5-rcw8", "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/security/advisories/GHSA-p9rh-jxmq-gq47", "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libppd/security/advisories/GHSA-7xfx-47qg-grp6", "https://www.cups.org", "https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47076"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 71.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "54b95d6c-c835-3938-9958-98eb469679ff", "product": {"name": "libcupsfilters"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.1b1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67d5d18b-22bf-3539-aee6-6ec0d99ed555", "vendor": {"name": "OpenPrinting"}}], "isExploited": false}
