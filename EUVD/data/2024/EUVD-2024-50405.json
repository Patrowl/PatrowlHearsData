This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This missing authorization aspect of this was patched in 2.4.1, while the Cross-Site Scripting was fully patched in 2.4.4.", "datePublished": "2024-12-06T08:24:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-06T14:18:26", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4dcf1133-d437-4f0a-b2cf-c91e0f6b6ca9?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3201198%40event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner&new=3201198%40event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3172740%40event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner&new=3172740%40event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9866"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "178dd14c-5ffe-3d25-a826-c23c7408eb51", "product": {"name": "Event Tickets with Ticket Scanner"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd915033-988b-3c70-af5b-71c3a395f512", "vendor": {"name": "sasonikolov"}}], "isExploited": false}
