A control-flow timing lean has been identified in the reference implementation of the Kyber key encapsulation mechanism when it is compiled with Clang 15-18 for `-Os`, `-O1`, and other compilation options. A proof-of-concept local attack on the reference implementation leaks the entire ML-KEM 512 secret key in ~10 minutes using end-to-end decapsulation timing measurements. The issue has been fixed in version 0.10.1. As a possible workaround, some compiler options may produce vectorized code that does not leak secret information, however relying on these compiler options as a workaround may not be reliable.", "datePublished": "2024-06-10T12:47:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:37:05", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-f2v9-5498-2vpp", "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/982c762c242ef549c914891b47bf6e0ed6321f91", "https://github.com/pq-crystals/kyber/commit/9b8d30698a3e7449aeb34e62339d4176f11e3c6c", "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/7eecda6095c003ddded7175a1ffdf35a2ce63ed5/src/kem/kyber/pqcrystals-kyber_kyber512_ref/poly.c#L166"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-36405"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bfc73a70-9df1-398b-b3b5-0607112ede47", "product": {"name": "liboqs"}, "product_version": "< 0.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39cafd2c-e78b-301b-9293-a008df083dd5", "vendor": {"name": "open-quantum-safe"}}], "isExploited": false}
