This is due to the user impersonation feature inappropriately determining the current user via user-supplied input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to generate an impersonation link that will allow them to log in as any existing user, such as an administrator. NOTE: The user impersonation feature was disabled in version 1.1.0 and re-enabled with a patch in version 1.1.2.", "datePublished": "2024-11-13T09:30:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T14:59:40", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de8e7adc-3777-4fb1-a708-68da950e3d4f?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3184657/multimanager-wp", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3184678/multimanager-wp", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3184826/multimanager-wp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11028"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d5cb858e-f53b-31e1-b4af-f84ad2b0bddd", "product": {"name": "MultiManager WP \u2013 Manage All Your WordPress Sites Easily"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7ef073fc-3b21-342e-bba7-b6c21915dbb2", "vendor": {"name": "icdsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
