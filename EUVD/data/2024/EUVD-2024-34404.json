This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin access privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "datePublished": "2025-01-26T11:09:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-27T15:32:00", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6eb6611d-7a4b-4ca8-b9cc-c156437e89b5?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3225861/vikbooking"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11641"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ed339fb-e9db-3ada-984a-198c83f8b833", "product": {"name": "VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.7.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e5e9a7a4-f678-3fac-9934-b327a39dcd99", "vendor": {"name": "e4jvikwp"}}], "isExploited": false}
