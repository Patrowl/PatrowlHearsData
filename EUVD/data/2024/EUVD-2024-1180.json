Prior to version 0.42.0, an attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory sending a large number of `NEW_CONNECTION_ID` frames that retire old connection IDs. The receiver is supposed to respond to each retirement frame with a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the vast majority of) these `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID` frames by collapsing the peers congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. Version 0.42.0 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2024-04-04T14:25:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-23T19:29:41", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-c33x-xqrf-c478", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22189", "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/4a99b816ae3ab03ae5449d15aac45147c85ed47a", "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go", "https://seemann.io/posts/2024-03-19-exploiting-quics-connection-id-management", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqXtYcZAtIA&t=3683s"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-22189", "GHSA-c33x-xqrf-c478"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "70d8f410-c668-3983-8bfb-bb8079db5ca2", "product": {"name": "quic-go"}, "product_version": "< 0.42.0"}, {"id": "cf12892a-4383-3205-bb45-f6ad6a574c60", "product": {"name": "quic-go"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cf12892a-4383-3205-bb45-f6ad6a574c60", "vendor": {"name": "quic-go"}}], "isExploited": false}
