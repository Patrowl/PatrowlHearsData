When establishing the connection with the upstream Kafka server using a TLS secured connection, Kroxylicious fails to properly verify the server's hostname, resulting in an insecure connection. For a successful attack to be performed, the attacker needs to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack or compromise any external systems, such as DNS or network routing configuration. This issue is considered a high complexity attack, with additional high privileges required, as the attack would need access to the Kroxylicious configuration or a peer system. The result of a successful attack impacts both data integrity and confidentiality.", "datePublished": "2024-08-30T21:10:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T20:57:19", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8285", "https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious/commit/8be1efcb0a2160fa3ad4cb0e5a27e60160774dce", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:9571", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-8285", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2308606", "https://github.com/kroxylicious/kroxylicious"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8285", "GHSA-h83p-72jv-g7vp"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2dfd384-aecc-3d9c-b4ce-8cba55c8223c", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
