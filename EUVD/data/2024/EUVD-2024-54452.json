This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes.\r\n\r\n*It is unclear exactly which version the issue was patched in from the changelog. Therefore, we used the latest version at the time of verification.", "datePublished": "2025-05-03T02:21:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T14:34:25", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4635f5c1-c326-4f53-bc54-a402cf5dae00?source=cve", "https://stylemixthemes.com/motors/", "https://themeforest.net/item/motors-automotive-cars-vehicle-boat-dealership-classifieds-wordpress-theme/13987211"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13738"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "83f582fd-36fc-3f8a-b874-57db58446b38", "product": {"name": "Motors - Car Dealer, Rental & Listing WordPress theme"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.6.65"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "493697e2-4e8b-3506-92cb-2a891e996a41", "vendor": {"name": "StylemixThemes"}}], "isExploited": false}
