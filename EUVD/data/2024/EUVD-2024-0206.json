{"id": "EUVD-2024-0206", "enisaUuid": "d6b87d85-9546-3f47-a6a4-469bb410aab8", "description": "lxml_html_clean is a project for HTML cleaning functionalities copied from `lxml.html.clean`. Prior to version 0.4.0, the HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content. Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue. As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Via `remove_tags`, one may specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags. Via `kill_tags`, one may specify tags to be removed completely. Via `allow_tags`, one may restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`.", "datePublished": "2024-11-20T12:15:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-14T07:22:17", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/fedora-python/lxml_html_clean/security/advisories/GHSA-5jfw-gq64-q45f", "https://github.com/fedora-python/lxml_html_clean/commit/c5d816f86eb3707d72a8ecf5f3823e0daa1b3808", "https://github.com/fedora-python/lxml_html_clean/pull/19", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52595", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/lxml-html-clean/PYSEC-2024-160.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52595", "GHSA-5jfw-gq64-q45f", "PYSEC-2024-160"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b84e34c1-dd18-3020-a39c-a36223cfd8d5", "product": {"name": "lxml_html_clean"}, "product_version": "< 0.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "519c0fae-577a-3a0d-9b9d-c3fae83903a3", "vendor": {"name": "fedora-python"}}], "isExploited": false}
