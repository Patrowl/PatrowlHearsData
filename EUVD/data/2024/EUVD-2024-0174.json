There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.", "datePublished": "2024-02-05T11:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T04:23:02", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6845-xw22-ffxv", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c150fc49ee9375a930d177044559b83cb95f7963/vyper/ir/compile_ir.py#L585-L586", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24559", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4063", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/d9f9fdadd81a148cbc68f02dbbbcdc0c92fad652", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/vyper/PYSEC-2024-147.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24559", "GHSA-6845-xw22-ffxv", "PYSEC-2024-147"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7e18a704-58e5-3a9e-ac5d-380b63d000a9", "product": {"name": "vyper"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.3.10"}, {"id": "8ee35d07-ebf1-36f6-93d2-84faff377967", "product": {"name": "vyper"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "14962cc9-5b11-38ef-983d-3962c1def12f", "vendor": {"name": "vyperlang"}}], "isExploited": false}
