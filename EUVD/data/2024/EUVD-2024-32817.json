The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization of special elements used in a command within the 'open_file' function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious file path that, when processed by the 'open_file' function, executes arbitrary system commands or reads sensitive file content. This issue is present in the code where subprocess.Popen is used unsafely to open files based on user-supplied paths without adequate validation, leading to potential command injection.", "datePublished": "2024-05-22T19:29:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:33:53", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/5a127724-cc13-4ea6-b81f-41546a7fff81"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4267"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 1.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bf6679d9-bade-3cd8-8f99-0eba441f894c", "product": {"name": "parisneo/lollms-webui"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1314a8b6-20b8-3709-b241-b614b2d9ceb2", "vendor": {"name": "parisneo"}}], "isExploited": false}
