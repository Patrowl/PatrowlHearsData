This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Note: Since the widget code isn't part of the code, to apply the patch, the affected widgets: Image Tooltip, Notification, Simple Popup, Video Play Button, and Card Carousel, must be deleted and reinstalled manually.", "datePublished": "2025-01-09T08:24:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-09T15:17:35", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/99625a3e-b8a4-42f8-8996-f7c5c0ff2d5f?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/unlimited-elements-for-elementor/#developers", "https://unlimited-elements.com/change-log/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13153"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e086dcd0-096a-32e4-9062-56312465b5b2", "product": {"name": "Unlimited Elements For Elementor"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.5.135"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f690095-6c9b-370a-9bc5-671ca0a00821", "vendor": {"name": "unitecms"}}], "isExploited": false}
