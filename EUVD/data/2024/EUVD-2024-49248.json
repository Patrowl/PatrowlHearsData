This is due the plugin not sanitizing a file path in an error message. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.", "datePublished": "2024-09-07T08:37:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-09T13:56:15", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1bd308a4-7157-4bc6-a55b-c6a4a62510a9?source=cve", "https://github.com/uglyrobot/big-file-uploads/blob/master/tuxedo_big_file_uploads.php#L601", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3147755/tuxedo-big-file-uploads/trunk/tuxedo_big_file_uploads.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8538"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee30a379-c5f8-35c7-a605-8d1c0179afbe", "product": {"name": "Big File Uploads \u2013 Increase Maximum File Upload Size"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1f2d7efb-add1-3ed1-9c68-527645c42205", "vendor": {"name": "uglyrobot"}}], "isExploited": false}
