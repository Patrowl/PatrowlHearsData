Special:WikiDiscover is a special page that lists all wikis on the wiki farm. However, the special page does not make any effort to escape the wiki name or description. Therefore, if a wiki sets its name and/or description to an XSS payload, the XSS will execute whenever the wiki is shown on Special:WikiDiscover. This issue has been patched with commit `2ce846dd93` and all users are advised to apply that patch. User unable to upgrade should block access to `Special:WikiDiscover`.", "datePublished": "2024-10-07T21:28:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-08T14:11:43", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/security/advisories/GHSA-wf48-rqx3-39mf", "https://github.com/miraheze/WikiDiscover/commit/2ce846dd93ddb9ec86f7472c4d57fe71a09dc827", "https://issue-tracker.miraheze.org/T12697"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47782"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4d22e64d-a456-3daa-a857-5632bdb48016", "product": {"name": "WikiDiscover"}, "product_version": "commits before 2ce846dd93ddb9ec86f7472c4d57fe71a09dc827"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1d5a77ca-71d7-3736-835f-713018bb25b6", "vendor": {"name": "miraheze"}}], "isExploited": false}
