The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability.\u00a0\n\nThe attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-05-03T08:11:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:55:52", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35701", "https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/7abeb1df463cc389f668172e7cf3bb772799858a", "https://github.com/apache/hive", "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-27554", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/7zcv6l63spl4r66xwz5jv9rtrg2opx81", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/03/3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-35701", "GHSA-vpw3-3prf-3974"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "590ed00d-3bbe-3b7f-b945-60d2923d6d89", "product": {"name": "Apache Hive"}, "product_version": "4.0.0-alpha-1 <4.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a920f89b-8413-334d-9f49-266c985a28e5", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
