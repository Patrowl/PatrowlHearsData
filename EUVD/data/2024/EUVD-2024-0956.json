The custom action behind WiX's `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and 4.0.5.", "datePublished": "2024-03-24T19:46:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:10:54", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-jx4p-m4wm-vvjg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29188", "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix/commit/2e5960b575881567a8807e6b8b9c513138b19742", "https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/commit/93eeb5f6835776694021f66d4226c262c67d487a", "https://github.com/wixtoolset/issues"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-29188", "GHSA-jx4p-m4wm-vvjg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b69d19e9-baad-364b-8cce-d9a12e3e4bc2", "product": {"name": "issues"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.0.5"}, {"id": "b750e72e-a561-349f-bc22-241ebf5671b5", "product": {"name": "issues"}}, {"id": "e0b707e0-541c-3dad-964a-fdd82884b91f", "product": {"name": "issues"}, "product_version": "< 3.14.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a45a7316-fea5-3f6f-86c5-be3e6ec613b9", "vendor": {"name": "wixtoolset"}}], "isExploited": false}
