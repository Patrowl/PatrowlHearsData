This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary option values on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to delete an option that would create an error on the site and deny service to legitimate users.", "datePublished": "2025-03-07T06:40:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-07T16:05:01", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/23f53ff1-f0bc-4ad3-9b9e-cf365f064066?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/flex-mag-responsive-wordpress-news-theme/12772303"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13655"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84066e72-e382-352e-a05b-bd35e310f508", "product": {"name": "Flex Mag - Responsive WordPress News Theme"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a449a9dc-f721-3049-8bd7-b75169329300", "vendor": {"name": "MVPThemes"}}], "isExploited": false}
