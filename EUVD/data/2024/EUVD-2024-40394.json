It seems to be largely the same binary as used by the Iocharger Pedestal charging station, however. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted> binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a crafted HTTP request.\n\nImpact: Critical \u2013 The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete\nfiles and services.\n\nCVSS clarification: The attack can be executed over any network connection serving the web interface (AV:N). There are no additional measures that need to be circumvented (AC:L) or attack preconditions (AT:N). THe attack is privileged, but the level does not matter (PR:L) and does not require user interaction (UI:N). Attack leads to full system compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H) and compromised devices can be used to \"pivot\" to other networks that should be unreachable (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Because this an EV charger using high power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P). The attack can be automated (AU:Y).", "datePublished": "2025-01-09T07:56:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-09T15:09:57", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:H/S:P/AU:Y", "references": ["https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2024-00035/", "https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2024-43650/", "https://iocharger.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43650"], "assigner": "DIVD", "epss": 4.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "501d7ff7-c343-3fdb-9892-4e5eaef627ba", "product": {"name": "Iocharger firmware for AC models"}, "product_version": "0 <24120701"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c44dafa6-eb0f-3f21-9dc8-196a76d1f61a", "vendor": {"name": "Iocharger"}}], "isExploited": false}
