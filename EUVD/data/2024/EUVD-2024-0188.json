When a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call getpeername() waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function. A remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required. Waitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.", "datePublished": "2024-10-29T05:15:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-19T09:19:01", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/1ae4e894c9f76543bee06584001583fc6fa8c95c", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00012.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49769", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/waitress/PYSEC-2024-211.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-49769", "GHSA-3f84-rpwh-47g6", "PYSEC-2024-211"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "028b58db-22de-3dac-9430-318425f547e4", "product": {"name": "Waitress"}, "product_version": "< 3.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "05595e35-30d0-341e-857a-72a1ab2c214c", "vendor": {"name": "Pylons"}}], "isExploited": false}
