Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-07-16T09:20:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:53:20", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39887", "https://github.com/apache/superset/commit/56f0103b5771d477dd106272abbd8021c9ea7506", "https://github.com/apache/superset", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/j55vm41jg3l0x6w49zrmvbf3k0ts5fqz", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/16/5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39887", "GHSA-2q6j-vpvr-6pvj"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 53.76, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fa202aae-879e-3d8e-834e-59a0a83f6b34", "product": {"name": "Apache Superset"}, "product_version": "0 <4.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e16f4eb-2c0c-3d7d-aae3-279e199bd366", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
