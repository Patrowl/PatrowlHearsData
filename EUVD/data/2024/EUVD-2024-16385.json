This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handle_create_link() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add related posts to other posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This ultimately makes it possible for attackers to view draft and password protected posts.", "datePublished": "2024-03-13T15:26:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:11:35", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5d21aad7-dbee-4204-afbd-0a5fdeaca50e?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/related-posts-for-wp/trunk/classes/hooks/class-hook-link-related-screen.php#L70", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3049719/related-posts-for-wp/tags/2.2.2/classes/hooks/class-hook-link-related-screen.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-0592"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c4a8797e-22c3-3c5e-8664-f6deeda76cec", "product": {"name": "Related Posts for WordPress"}}, {"id": "e1b59124-d26e-393a-83a8-2f0dc97ac408", "product": {"name": "Related Posts for WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.2.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f03072c8-0df2-3545-b5fe-7f95985e7ff4", "vendor": {"name": "barrykooij"}}], "isExploited": false}
