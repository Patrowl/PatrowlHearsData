An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane protocol relationships to fail, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-09-11T16:38:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-11T20:38:58", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-l2services-2mvHdNuC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20317"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1948c720-5408-3a17-acc3-ff7a527c775c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.9.2"}, {"id": "22974b0f-90db-31b8-800f-06f153d16536", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.10.1"}, {"id": "45547362-ae13-323b-b923-718a5d30e8f9", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.8.22"}, {"id": "85634d78-2cfc-32b9-a7d4-cceb9a5d7df0", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.9.1"}, {"id": "8ebe80c2-eafe-3310-93fe-182f509d58e2", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.7.21"}, {"id": "a6c4b402-d8b0-3228-aca2-13eed77f2751", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.8.1"}, {"id": "d1762d64-2bd2-3d31-b29d-cc5eea51b015", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.7.2"}, {"id": "f59f5e94-6673-300a-97af-b588e5bd67d3", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.8.2"}, {"id": "f8942647-07e5-3188-83ec-5b782dc193e6", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.7.1"}, {"id": "fc8eb4b7-facf-38ae-9a78-650062ef3372", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "7.9.21"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "852c05d3-9ad1-3529-823e-a33bda369c86", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
