When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.", "datePublished": "2024-08-01T21:44:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T13:08:18", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-46pw-v7qw-xc2f", "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/b29f4abcd4b3382fa746edd1d0562b7b48c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41965"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e6a210be-d976-3d75-b5e3-7a99b0c1b9d0", "product": {"name": "vim"}, "product_version": "< 9.1.0648"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "10a83ba9-bbb9-3ab6-9376-38fea8956ad1", "vendor": {"name": "vim"}}], "isExploited": false}
