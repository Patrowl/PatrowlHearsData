Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and 2.6.0, the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the triggerer service without masking. This allows anyone with access to the metadata or triggerer log to obtain the configuration file and use it to access the Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis behavior was changed in version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents and started providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 7.0.0, which fixes this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-01-24T12:56:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-11T16:48:05", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51702", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29498", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30110", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36492", "https://github.com/apache/airflow", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/89x3q6lz5pykrkr1fkr04k4rfn9pvnv9", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/24/3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-51702", "GHSA-mg2x-mggj-6955"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f4a1a4c-14c4-3735-8387-9609ab684733", "product": {"name": "Apache Airflow"}}, {"id": "7980ef74-2249-3b63-854e-53b6c561c91d", "product": {"name": "Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes provider"}}, {"id": "e9de6d88-868f-31f3-ba8d-602a3cba921e", "product": {"name": "Apache Airflow"}, "product_version": "2.3.0 <2.6.1"}, {"id": "ead02811-8d7f-3fb5-9a45-7c874b535868", "product": {"name": "Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes provider"}, "product_version": "5.2.0 <7.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a03a47a-5311-3c55-b490-12423cfc9045", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
