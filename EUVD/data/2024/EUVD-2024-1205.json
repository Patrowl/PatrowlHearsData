{"id": "EUVD-2024-1205", "enisaUuid": "5702e53e-959b-318e-8c93-f7313e2bca5a", "description": "An issue was discovered in gradio-app/gradio, where the `/component_server` endpoint improperly allows the invocation of any method on a `Component` class with attacker-controlled arguments. Specifically, by exploiting the `move_resource_to_block_cache()` method of the `Block` class, an attacker can copy any file on the filesystem to a temporary directory and subsequently retrieve it. This vulnerability enables unauthorized local file read access, posing a significant risk especially when the application is exposed to the internet via `launch(share=True)`, thereby allowing remote attackers to read files on the host machine. Furthermore, gradio apps hosted on `huggingface.co` are also affected, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information such as API keys and credentials stored in environment variables.", "datePublished": "2024-04-16T00:00:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:32:16", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1561", "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/24a583688046867ca8b8b02959c441818bdb34a2", "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio", "https://huntr.com/bounties/4acf584e-2fe8-490e-878d-2d9bf2698338", "https://www.gradio.app/changelog#4-13-0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1561", "GHSA-g9cj-cfpp-4g2x"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 93.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bce8117c-cace-3133-a28c-ef5d3302e158", "product": {"name": "gradio-app/gradio"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.13.0"}, {"id": "d97c940a-50b2-33c5-b627-995a85ffa80e", "product": {"name": "gradio-app/gradio"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "863cf1a2-6843-373e-a205-a17a75f30564", "vendor": {"name": "gradio-app"}}], "isExploited": false}
