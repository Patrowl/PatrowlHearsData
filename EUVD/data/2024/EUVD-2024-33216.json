This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2024-11-09T03:18:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-12T15:49:46", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eeb2c829-579f-41e2-ad5f-8e4fc125d980?source=cve", "https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-support-ticket-system/17930050"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-10626"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 24.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1552471e-0ce2-3bbf-865c-037168dd88d0", "product": {"name": "WooCommerce Support Ticket System"}, "product_version": "* \u226417.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f9046529-64d7-386a-b319-228e7d73238f", "vendor": {"name": "vanquish"}}], "isExploited": false}
