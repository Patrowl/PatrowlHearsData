An attacker can request any `route` we want as long as we specify an `operation` that is allowed. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.0 by applying the same access control pattern as in `UI.php` to the `ajax.render.php` page which does not allow arbitrary `routes` to be dispatched. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-11-07T17:55:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T18:16:51", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Combodo/iTop/security/advisories/GHSA-3mxr-8r3j-j2j9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-51995"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b623abd3-00ba-3415-90e8-2b2105eff5be", "product": {"name": "iTop"}, "product_version": "< 3.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9e88e83c-be7a-3b8e-93ee-37aa7a047497", "vendor": {"name": "Combodo"}}], "isExploited": false}
