In select.ts:createOption(), the text variable from the user-provided Options object is assigned to an innerHTML without sanitation. Software that depends on this library to dynamically generate lists using unsanitized user-provided input may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting, resulting in attacker executed JavaScript. At this time, no patch is available.", "datePublished": "2024-10-02T18:40:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-29T02:04:42", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9440", "https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select/issues/564", "https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select/pull/572", "https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select/commit/f8534f27d6e9bab89024d139f1c4f7555f1efd5e", "https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select", "https://github.com/brianvoe/slim-select/blob/e7e37e2ff90e125f846bd98d6b8f278524ead79e/src/slim-select/select.ts#L377", "https://vulncheck.com/advisories/slim-select-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9440", "GHSA-qvqv-mcxr-x8qw"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [], "isExploited": false}
