This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_theme() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary themes from the website via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. In versions prior to 1.8.6 it was possible to download the entire sites files.", "datePublished": "2024-08-16T06:40:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-13T14:06:00", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/dcbfcaeb-2635-4b11-b426-ee04345d5f36?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3136231/download-plugins-dashboard/tags/1.8.8/includes/class-alg-download-plugins-core.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7501"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb77d49e-564e-36f7-bc58-a66a2dc3685b", "product": {"name": "Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8fe9c556-514a-3a82-89c9-7c502671056e", "vendor": {"name": "algoritmika"}}], "isExploited": false}
