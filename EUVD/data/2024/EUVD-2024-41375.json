A malicious RPKI repository that descends from a (trusted) Trust Anchor can serve (via rsync or RRDP) an ROA or a Manifest containing a signedAttrs encoded in non-canonical form. This bypasses Fort's BER decoder, reaching a point in the code that panics when faced with data not encoded in DER. Because Fort is an RPKI Relying Party, a panic can lead to Route Origin Validation unavailability, which can lead to compromised routing.", "datePublished": "2024-08-24T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:39:02", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45234", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00030.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45234"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c6635e78-b52a-3c6a-b3c1-1abd255468f9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dbc4f928-0ddc-35a4-9db7-a31729a18d26", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
