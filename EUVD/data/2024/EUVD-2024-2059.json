Use of an exclusion under an arrow that has multiple resources may resolve to `NO_PERMISSION` when permission is expected. If the resource exists under *multiple* folders and the user has access to view more than a single folder, SpiceDB may report the user does not have access due to a failure in the exclusion dispatcher to request that *all* the folders in which the user is a member be returned. Permission is returned as `NO_PERMISSION` when `PERMISSION` is expected on the `CheckPermission` API. This issue has been addressed in version 1.33.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-06-20T22:18:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:04:25", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-grjv-gjgr-66g2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38361", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/ecef31d2b266fde17eb2c3415e2ec4ceff96fbeb", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-38361", "GHSA-grjv-gjgr-66g2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8975d6d0-4f3d-32cc-94c0-44a48630844f", "product": {"name": "spicedb"}, "product_version": "< 1.33.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5f41f1d5-34f5-32b2-8860-1e7e843a6fbb", "vendor": {"name": "authzed"}}], "isExploited": false}
