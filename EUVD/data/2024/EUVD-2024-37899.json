Prior to version 2.12.6, the endpoint \n`/admin/projects/{projectname}/skills/{skillname}/video` (and probably others) is open to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Due to the endpoint being CSRFable e.g POST request, supports a content type that can be exploited (multipart file upload), makes a state change and has no CSRF mitigations in place (samesite flag, CSRF token). It is possible to perform a CSRF attack against a logged in admin account, allowing an attacker that can target a logged in admin of Skills Service to modify the videos, captions, and text of the skill. Version 2.12.6 contains a patch for this issue.\n", "datePublished": "2024-07-02T20:55:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:19:20", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/security/advisories/GHSA-9624-qwxr-jr4j", "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/commit/68d4235ddcb16e4f33fc7f19d14ff917817a366c", "https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/skills-service/blob/24dd22f43306fc616e4580fb8bb88f66b5d9b41d/service/src/main/java/skills/controller/AdminController.groovy#L574"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39326"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a732dee3-19d0-3e09-9b00-6c52c3ce38f8", "product": {"name": "skills-service"}, "product_version": "< 2.12.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c4f8e8d9-9e37-3e06-a5dc-6eca0359897c", "vendor": {"name": "NationalSecurityAgency"}}], "isExploited": false}
