An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a malicious file into the search path, which the application might execute instead of the legitimate file. This could occur when the application uses a search path to locate executables or libraries. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction, attack complexity is high.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T19:06:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T02:42:59", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/premiere_pro/apsb24-46.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-34123"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bdaaa724-6bbf-3afa-b6c8-16a7334958e3", "product": {"name": "Premiere Pro"}, "product_version": "0 \u226424.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7fe33187-f53a-3fc6-962f-f489d7035e11", "vendor": {"name": "Adobe"}}], "isExploited": false}
