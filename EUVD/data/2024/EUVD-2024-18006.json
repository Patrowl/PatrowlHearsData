An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that should be protected by an ACL that was applied on port channel subinterfaces.", "datePublished": "2024-02-28T16:16:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-09T14:58:23", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-po-acl-TkyePgvL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20291"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 12.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1979a5e7-e69f-3118-b983-9c138e590b24", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "9.3(11)"}, {"id": "7ec33fcc-7c1b-37bf-83a7-287ef6d15248", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "9.3(10)"}, {"id": "c9c1db1e-744c-35d4-ae52-da245b2d4e7e", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "9.3(12)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "408653f0-1e63-3006-b093-4975c34ef605", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
