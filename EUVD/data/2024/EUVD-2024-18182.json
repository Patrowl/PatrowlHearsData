An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific sizes of fragmented packets to an affected device or through a Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR)-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers if they are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 17.12.1 or 17.12.1a.", "datePublished": "2024-09-25T16:28:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T18:56:11", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cpp-vfr-dos-nhHKGgO"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20467"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 21.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2cc19f7f-5389-3819-b20b-19a7e71c68d3", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "17.12.1"}, {"id": "663de481-3167-36db-b557-4064f037c3be", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "17.12.1a"}, {"id": "9852469b-44fe-3cf5-a9bf-9d70ae3b78be", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "17.11.99SW"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "10de61d7-b2b8-374a-b947-676899e461e9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
