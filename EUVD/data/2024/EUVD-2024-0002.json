Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.  Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling. The unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2 fixes this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-01-29T22:41:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:36:49", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8074", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/33ccdfb0a12690af5bb49bda2319ec0907fa7827", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XXWVZIVAYWEBHNRIILZVB3R3SDQNNAA7/", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23829", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/3235", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8074/files", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/aiohttp/PYSEC-2024-26.yaml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ICUOCFGTB25WUT336BZ4UNYLSZOUVKBD", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ICUOCFGTB25WUT336BZ4UNYLSZOUVKBD/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00002.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-23829", "GHSA-8qpw-xqxj-h4r2", "PYSEC-2024-26"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d4134108-f526-397e-9005-667d8a152a81", "product": {"name": "aiohttp"}, "product_version": "< 3.9.2"}, {"id": "f7ad8796-3190-3248-9982-1d60724cf203", "product": {"name": "aiohttp"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c1f6f0ec-3cb5-3c15-a51e-f9c2aeb4b334", "vendor": {"name": "aio-libs"}}], "isExploited": false}
