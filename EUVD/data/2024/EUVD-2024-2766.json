Starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.44.0, the Email Templating feature uses Jinja2 without proper input sanitization or rendering environment restrictions, allowing for Server-Side Template Injection that grants Remote Code Execution to privileged users. A privileged user refers to an Admin UI user with the default `Owner` or `Contributor` role, who can escalate their access and execute code on the underlying Fides Webserver container where the Jinja template rendering function is executed. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.44.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There are no workarounds.", "datePublished": "2024-09-04T16:04:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-04T18:02:37", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-c34r-238x-f7qx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45053", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/829cbd9cb5ef9c814fbac1ed6800e8d939d359c5", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45053", "GHSA-c34r-238x-f7qx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.97, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e8d1c0fc-96fd-3c3c-811f-f42e6d87a5c8", "product": {"name": "fides"}, "product_version": "2.19.0, < 2.44.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af20de12-c883-3876-9176-8b4df423322b", "vendor": {"name": "ethyca"}}], "isExploited": false}
