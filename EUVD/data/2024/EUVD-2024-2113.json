The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`\"\"`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8.", "datePublished": "2024-06-22T16:12:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:11:12", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5443", "https://github.com/parisneo/lollms/commit/2d0c4e76be93195836ecd0948027e791b8a2626f", "https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms", "https://huntr.com/bounties/db52848a-4dbe-4110-a981-03739834bf45"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5443", "GHSA-mvrm-fh8q-6wr2"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 17.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9e812e7b-08a1-344e-b7ce-5e012e44e2c3", "product": {"name": "parisneo/lollms"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dfac523e-3cb8-34d9-96e6-f6a84d77f771", "vendor": {"name": "parisneo"}}], "isExploited": false}
