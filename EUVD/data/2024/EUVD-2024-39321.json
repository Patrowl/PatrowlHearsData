An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c module, where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from a received SNMP packet. In one place, one byte is read from the buffer, without checking that the buffer has another byte available, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request #2936. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.", "datePublished": "2024-11-27T18:20:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-27T19:22:42", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-qjj3-gqx7-438w", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2936"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41125"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bfaab685-d1e7-39c6-8286-38f324fb9b2f", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ef4b85ba-db13-3d62-bbf1-f7f1daf76bc4", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
