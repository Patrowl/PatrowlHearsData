Shields.io and users self-hosting their own instance of shields using version < `server-2024-09-25` are vulnerable to a remote execution vulnerability via the JSONPath library used by the Dynamic JSON/Toml/Yaml badges. This vulnerability would allow any user with access to make a request to a URL on the instance to the ability to execute code by crafting a malicious JSONPath expression. All users who self-host an instance are vulnerable. This problem was fixed in server-2024-09-25. Those who follow the tagged releases should update to `server-2024-09-25` or later. Those who follow the rolling tag on DockerHub, `docker pull shieldsio/shields:next` to update to the latest version. As a workaround, blocking access to the endpoints `/badge/dynamic/json`, `/badge/dynamic/toml`, and `/badge/dynamic/yaml` (e.g: via a firewall or reverse proxy in front of your instance) would prevent the exploitable endpoints from being accessed.", "datePublished": "2024-09-26T19:21:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-26T19:47:50", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/badges/shields/security/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-x284-4445", "https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/10553", "https://github.com/badges/shields/pull/10551", "https://github.com/badges/shields/commit/ec1b6c8daccda075403c1688ac02603f7aaa50b2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47180"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fa9d3b06-4275-314e-aafe-ddff51fb603e", "product": {"name": "shields"}, "product_version": "< server-2024-09-25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de56707d-216e-3087-b1c3-60c28fc289de", "vendor": {"name": "badges"}}], "isExploited": false}
