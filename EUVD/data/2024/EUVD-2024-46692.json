The vulnerability arises because the application does not adequately validate URLs entered by users, allowing them to input arbitrary URLs, including those that target internal resources such as 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'. This flaw enables attackers to make unauthorized requests to internal or external systems, potentially leading to access to sensitive data, service disruption, network integrity compromise, business logic manipulation, and abuse of third-party resources. The issue is critical and requires immediate attention to maintain the application's security and integrity.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T17:56:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:11:12", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/d97e23e7-172f-4862-a732-86bfc0b7860e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5482"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10d29e92-979e-31b7-bbc6-35e2f7e58b96", "product": {"name": "parisneo/lollms-webui"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7aed0320-e13d-3b4e-8912-2f67679d975b", "vendor": {"name": "parisneo"}}], "isExploited": false}
