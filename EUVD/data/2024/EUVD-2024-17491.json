{"id": "EUVD-2024-17491", "enisaUuid": "ec344fac-97a9-3bf9-9ada-efbda9742bd4", "description": "The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's Display Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.", "datePublished": "2024-06-12T11:05:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:48:21", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9774c999-acb6-4c5f-ad6c-10979660b164?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/download-manager/trunk/src/User/views/dashboard/edit-profile.php#L16"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1766"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4fd8792b-7c77-395e-a1d8-347f268d04d0", "product": {"name": "Download Manager"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.2.86"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b751a09e-4293-3dbc-b509-72d2a081713b", "vendor": {"name": "codename065"}}], "isExploited": false}
