This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in 3.11.9. Additional hardening for alternate attack vectors was added to version 3.11.10.", "datePublished": "2024-09-13T05:30:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-13T14:01:29", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7c23bd29-ba02-4c90-a631-5ce6294d7760?source=cve", "https://avada.com/documentation/avada-changelog/", "https://avada.com/blog/version-7-11-9-security-update/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5628"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2754a4a5-303f-3e7d-b312-245d5c76faa1", "product": {"name": "Fusion Builder"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.11.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e84e9924-bf1e-3427-b08f-68d0b9a4e95a", "vendor": {"name": "ThemeFusion"}}], "isExploited": false}
