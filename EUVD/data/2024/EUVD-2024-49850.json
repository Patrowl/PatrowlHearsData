This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. In addition, site administrators have the option to grant lower-level users with access to manage the plugin's settings which may extend this vulnerability to those users.", "datePublished": "2024-10-04T06:48:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-04T13:42:52", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/128d45ec-941c-414c-b341-9964dc748132?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3161259%40booking&new=3158531%40booking&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9306"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6f16f406-56d9-3754-bd7b-1fd32d4a7cfa", "product": {"name": "WP Booking Calendar"}, "product_version": "* \u226410.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4d6893e4-7dc0-398d-b07c-15a94453cebb", "vendor": {"name": "wpdevelop"}}], "isExploited": false}
