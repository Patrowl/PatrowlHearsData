Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it: 1. the public key of the previous block (used in the signature), 2. the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair. Tokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations generated through a third party block request. This has been addressed in version 4 of the specification. Users are advised to update their implementations to conform. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-08-05T19:47:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:23:35", "baseScore": 3.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/security/advisories/GHSA-rgqv-mwc3-c78m", "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/commit/c87cbb5d778964d6574df3e9e6579567cad12fff"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-42350"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b395e600-a4ef-305b-9653-09dc9f19aba2", "product": {"name": "biscuit"}, "product_version": "< 4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "634397df-df56-35c3-8b93-3e60fb5eef7d", "vendor": {"name": "biscuit-auth"}}], "isExploited": false}
