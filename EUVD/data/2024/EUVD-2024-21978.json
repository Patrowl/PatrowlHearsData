In versions 4.5.0 and earlier, the $_REQUEST global array was unsafely called inside an extract() function in admin-logs.php. The PHP file fm-init.php prevents arbitrary manipulation of $_SESSION via the GET/POST parameters. However, it does not prevent manipulation of any other sensitive variables such as $search_sql. Knowing this, an authenticated user with privileges to view site logs can manipulate the search_sql\nvariable by appending a GET parameter search_sql in the URL. The information above means that the checks and SQL injection prevention attempts were rendered unusable.", "datePublished": "2024-01-31T22:33:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-17T17:08:31", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/security/advisories/GHSA-xw34-8pj6-75gc", "https://github.com/WillyXJ/facileManager/commit/0aa850d4b518f10143a4c675142b15caa5872877"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24572"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8d77c0fb-cb06-314c-a39c-badbcb527a7f", "product": {"name": "facileManager"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.5.0"}, {"id": "a684bfec-685c-3ba1-a0d0-73cade9ad4ac", "product": {"name": "facileManager"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c18076c3-203b-36d6-8a20-a70a848ae1de", "vendor": {"name": "WillyXJ"}}], "isExploited": false}
