An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSH messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available SSH resources on the affected device so that new SSH connections to the device are denied, resulting in a DoS condition. Existing SSH connections to the device would continue to function normally. The device must be rebooted manually to recover. However, user traffic would not be impacted and could be managed using a remote application such as Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).", "datePublished": "2024-10-23T17:53:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-23T18:41:16", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ssh-dos-eEDWu5RM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20526"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13bb742e-8e76-3cfa-874a-d49da334777e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.16.4.70"}, {"id": "1792d8a7-af11-3f4c-999a-28656f962270", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.16.4.67"}, {"id": "3477d312-9d09-3cf4-bb45-5e0c2b90cd19", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.18.4.40"}, {"id": "e35c9b8d-478f-3047-a0d0-bb976a56907d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.20.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4539493d-1654-3aba-9a50-64dabc380112", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
