This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Shop Manager-level access and above, to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.", "datePublished": "2025-02-07T16:21:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-07T16:38:32", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c9205896-487d-4b8f-84cf-7ba16e1205e3?source=cve", "https://www.wpallimport.com/upgrade-to-wp-all-export-pro/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7425"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "83470dda-a31a-368b-83d3-eb5c40e78790", "product": {"name": "WP All Export Pro"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.9.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9b08693b-a7a6-3da7-9a43-9005394fe8ce", "vendor": {"name": "WP All Import"}}], "isExploited": false}
