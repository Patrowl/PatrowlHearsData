Before moving to pulling translations from the openedx-translations repository via openedx-atlas, translations in the edx-platform repository were validated using edx-i18n-tools. This validation included protection against malformed translations and translations-based script injections. Prior to this patch, the validation implemented in the openedx-translations repository did not include the same protections. The maintainer inspected the translations in the edx-platform directory of both the main and open-release/redwood.master branches of the openedx-translations repository and found no evidence of exploited translation strings.", "datePublished": "2024-08-23T14:35:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-27T19:46:53", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/security/advisories/GHSA-fg8c-2pvj-wx3j", "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/3c4093705dec99590577c4d8270ce263f7fffc5a", "https://github.com/openedx/openedx-translations/commit/b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43782"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4eba84d2-645b-3298-a59e-21d627e95290", "product": {"name": "openedx-translations"}, "product_version": "< b2444340e8702c7955310331c1db5fd85b25b92b"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d90685c6-0639-35d2-b00f-ddb955bdaeed", "vendor": {"name": "openedx"}}], "isExploited": false}
