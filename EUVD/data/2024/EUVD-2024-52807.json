The exploitation vector of this vulnerability relies on an attacker obtaining Laravel's secret APP_KEY, which would allow them to decrypt and manipulate session cookies (laravel_session) containing serialized data. By altering this data and re-encrypting it with the APP_KEY, the attacker could trigger arbitrary deserialization on the server, potentially leading to remote command execution (RCE). The vulnerability is primarily exploited by accessing an exposed cookie and manipulating it using the secret key to gain malicious access to the server.", "datePublished": "2025-01-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T19:24:43", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.synacktiv.com/", "https://github.com/crater-invoice/crater", "https://www.synacktiv.com/advisories/crater-invoice-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-when-appkey-known"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55556"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 81.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "57e93380-e0a1-39f8-ad96-95ae9c1d66fa", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e3181a0-3ee7-34b5-9415-a9630fe7cf12", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
