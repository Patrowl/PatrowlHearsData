In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the ZimaOS API endpoint `http://<Zima_Server_IP:PORT>/v3/file?token=<token>&files=<file_path>` is vulnerable to arbitrary file reading due to improper input validation. By manipulating the `files` parameter, authenticated users can read sensitive system files, including `/etc/shadow`, which contains password hashes for all users. This vulnerability exposes critical system data and poses a high risk for privilege escalation or system compromise. The vulnerability occurs because the API endpoint does not validate or restrict file paths provided via the `files` parameter. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the file path to access sensitive files outside the intended directory. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "datePublished": "2024-10-24T20:49:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T17:33:10", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-hjw2-9gq5-qgwj", "https://youtu.be/FyIfcmCyDXs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-48931"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f99cd86b-c0f0-3100-90c6-0e5b1a505b80", "product": {"name": "ZimaOS"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cb1016be-1a3b-3c3b-b4f8-4ffca9d15c40", "vendor": {"name": "IceWhaleTech"}}], "isExploited": false}
