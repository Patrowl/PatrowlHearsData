A vulnerability in version 8.0 is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use invitations, not single-use invitation links as in the prior CVE. Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-admins to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations, and has also configured only admins to be able to invite users to streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users invite new users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can already see. Version 8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, administrators can limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the permission to add users to streams.", "datePublished": "2024-01-25T19:30:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T22:27:35", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-87p9-wprh-7rm6", "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-mrvp-96q6-jpvc", "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/0df7bd71f32f3b772e2646c6ab0d60c9b610addf", "https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams", "https://zulip.com/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21630"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "25ce57a0-20d9-3c6f-83e8-8bf1431bf95f", "product": {"name": "zulip"}}, {"id": "ea343b60-9837-3bf2-bd99-d5b8299a3f7e", "product": {"name": "zulip"}, "product_version": "= 8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25ce57a0-20d9-3c6f-83e8-8bf1431bf95f", "vendor": {"name": "zulip"}}], "isExploited": false}
