The administrator decides to remove an ACL\n2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.\n\nWhen those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.\n\nThe incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).\n\nThe full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.", "datePublished": "2024-04-12T06:58:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-30T03:55:45", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27309", "https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/c000b1fae2bd7d4b76713a53508f128a13431ab6", "https://github.com/apache/kafka", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/6536rmzyg076lzzdw2xdktvnz163mjpy", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0002", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/3", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240705-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27309", "GHSA-79vv-vp32-gpp7"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "419d53db-3b36-315b-b144-315357c8c454", "product": {"name": "Apache Kafka"}}, {"id": "b3f72a67-8409-310d-833c-5e3b4921e8bc", "product": {"name": "Apache Kafka"}, "product_version": "3.6.0 \u22643.6.1"}, {"id": "fc6fbd2e-4f8f-348e-971f-f16c931acd94", "product": {"name": "Apache Kafka"}, "product_version": "3.5.0 \u22643.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e49d5020-8cf1-3f1e-8342-f61b744a151f", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
