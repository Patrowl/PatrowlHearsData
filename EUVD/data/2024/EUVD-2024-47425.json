This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'afi_overview' function and missing file type validation in the 'upload_icons' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T07:38:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:33:05", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7e3fd472-c8ea-42dc-93df-872361ec97f3?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/attachment-file-icons/tags/1.3/attachment-file-icons.php#L130", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/attachment-file-icons/tags/1.3/attachment-file-icons.php#L337"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6309"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 2.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1dab656c-9493-3dcc-98b5-46208bc84742", "product": {"name": "Attachment File Icons (AF Icons)"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec555819-361e-30dd-a5d2-6ee310fe6417", "vendor": {"name": "praveen-rajan"}}], "isExploited": false}
