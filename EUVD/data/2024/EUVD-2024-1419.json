This behavior contravenes the Fetch standard, which mandates the removal of Authorization headers in cross-origin requests when the scheme, host, or port changes. Consequently, when a redirect downgrades from HTTPS to HTTP, the Authorization header may be inadvertently exposed in plaintext, leading to potential sensitive information disclosure to unauthorized actors. The flaw is located in the _build_redirect_request function of the redirect middleware.", "datePublished": "2024-05-20T08:15:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-15T17:37:50", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/security/advisories/GHSA-4qqq-9vqf-3h3f", "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/commit/1d0502f25bbe55a22899af915623fda1aaeb9dd8", "https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy", "https://huntr.com/bounties/27f6a021-a891-446a-ada5-0226d619dd1a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1968", "GHSA-4qqq-9vqf-3h3f"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "af861271-6e23-3963-8011-36cd626663de", "product": {"name": "scrapy/scrapy"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.11.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "759952d3-2d29-32d0-a09e-af585406e17a", "vendor": {"name": "scrapy"}}], "isExploited": false}
