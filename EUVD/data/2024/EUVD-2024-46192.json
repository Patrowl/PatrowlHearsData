By manipulating a DOM element through a crafted URL or user input, the attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page is rendered. User interaction is required for exploitation, as a victim must visit a malicious link or input data into a vulnerable web application.", "datePublished": "2024-12-10T22:04:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-11T15:28:31", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb24-69.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52860"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9edbe109-2f4c-36ba-978b-68f73fb29f2f", "product": {"name": "Adobe Experience Manager"}, "product_version": "0 \u22646.5.21"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "245cf99e-e730-3e87-96e9-8fe80eeb7c28", "vendor": {"name": "Adobe"}}], "isExploited": false}
