If exploited, the device would become unresponsive, and a manual restart will be required for recovery. Additionally, if exploited, there could be a loss of view for the downstream equipment sequences in the controller. Users would not be able to view the status or command the equipment sequences, however the equipment sequence would continue to execute uninterrupted.", "datePublished": "2024-09-27T21:31:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-22T21:31:16", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-us/trust-center/security-advisories/advisory.SD1679.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6436"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6436"], "assigner": "Rockwell", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0fc2dedc-a86d-341b-a810-9fd119fcac83", "product": {"name": "SequenceManager\u2122"}, "product_version": "<2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "323616be-c2f4-3b3a-b40d-9834095c7c86", "vendor": {"name": "Rockwell Automation"}}], "isExploited": false}
