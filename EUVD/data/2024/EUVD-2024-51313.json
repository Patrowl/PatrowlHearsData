This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file write, which can subsequently result in remote code execution. The issue arises when the filename transformation introduces '../' sequences, which are not sanitized by multer, allowing attackers with manager or admin roles to write files to arbitrary locations on the server.", "datePublished": "2025-02-10T18:53:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T23:18:49", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/92a875fe-c5b3-485c-b03f-d3185189e0b1", "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/0b7bf68f2c02ca68075970fbf85d5a70ca5e94ca", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13059"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13059"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 2.83, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "758ff680-c78c-3553-8df5-7f74bbbc435b", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "708a0b8e-f8dc-3003-93d3-93bcd7ffb48b", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
