{"id": "EUVD-2024-0073", "enisaUuid": "6bb55d59-20f6-3f05-a31d-901728182ecc", "description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a **race condition** in the `update_root_in_config` function, allowing an attacker to modify the `root` URL used by the Gradio frontend to communicate with the backend. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can redirect user traffic to a malicious server. This could lead to the interception of sensitive data such as authentication credentials or uploaded files. This impacts all users who connect to a Gradio server, especially those exposed to the internet, where malicious actors could exploit this race condition. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-10-11T02:15:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-20T12:22:23", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-xh2x-3mrm-fwqm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47870", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gradio/PYSEC-2024-218.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47870", "GHSA-xh2x-3mrm-fwqm", "PYSEC-2024-218"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "050568b8-a79d-3815-bf5b-20dd4a2147a7", "product": {"name": "gradio"}, "product_version": "< 5.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "49caa00c-bc91-38ee-a4a6-c8b75cc04af0", "vendor": {"name": "gradio-app"}}], "isExploited": false}
