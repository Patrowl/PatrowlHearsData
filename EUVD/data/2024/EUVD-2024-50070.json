This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with teacher-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2024-10-26T08:36:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T19:23:08", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/411693fc-9df3-44b1-9a6f-58a6e8ef23b8?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpschoolpress/tags/2.2.9/lib/wpsp-ajaxworks-teacher.php#L598"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9637"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "627f1ae6-578e-3f75-9d6e-4729d5cd40dd", "product": {"name": "School Management System \u2013 WPSchoolPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.2.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a906a9d3-a5b7-3a61-8346-975468b7068d", "vendor": {"name": "jdsofttech"}}], "isExploited": false}
