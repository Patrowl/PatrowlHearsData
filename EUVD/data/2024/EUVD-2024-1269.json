Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-04-25T17:15:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-05T19:21:20", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-ppx5-q359-pvwj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32481", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/5319cfbe14951e007ccdb323257e5ada869b35d5", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/9136169468f317a53b4e7448389aa315f90b95ba/vyper/codegen/stmt.py#L286-L287"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32481", "GHSA-ppx5-q359-pvwj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "edd36f5e-3d9c-3c0b-b9e2-8ccf3ccb852d", "product": {"name": "vyper"}, "product_version": "0.3.8, < 0.4.0b1"}, {"id": "f26e1f1e-bc78-362b-a4bb-e20103fef9ee", "product": {"name": "vyper"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "95e3f43f-5eae-3ee9-af8b-0b212f409e58", "vendor": {"name": "vyperlang"}}], "isExploited": false}
