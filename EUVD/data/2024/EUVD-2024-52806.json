This is exacerbated by .env files, available from the product's repository, that have default APP_KEY values. The route/{hash} route defined in the invoiceninja/routes/client.php file can be accessed without authentication. The parameter {hash} is passed to the function decrypt that expects a Laravel ciphered value containing a serialized object. (Furthermore, Laravel contains several gadget chains usable to trigger remote command execution from arbitrary deserialization.) Therefore, an attacker in possession of the APP_KEY is able to fully control a string passed to an unserialize function.", "datePublished": "2025-01-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-07T19:14:30", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/invoiceninja/invoiceninja/commit/d9302021472c3e7e23bac8c3d5fbec57a5f38f0c", "https://www.synacktiv.com/advisories/invoiceninja-unauthenticated-remote-command-execution-when-appkey-known"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55555"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 33.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c23d0ac8-e18a-319a-8e57-9107f4a61771", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a6f2005-5017-3f14-a3f5-9ef3a89f7b27", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
