Instead of validating the client's authorization reference, the helper invokes AuthorizationCopyRights() using its own privileged context (root), effectively authorizing itself rather than the client. As a result, it grants the system.preferences.admin right internally, regardless of the requesting client's privileges. This flawed logic allows unprivileged clients to invoke privileged operations via XPC, including unauthorized changes to system-wide network preferences such as SOCKS, HTTP, and HTTPS proxy settings. The absence of proper code-signing checks further enables arbitrary processes to exploit this flaw, leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through traffic redirection.", "datePublished": "2025-06-10T23:19:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-11T13:52:22", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://pentraze.com/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7457"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7457"], "assigner": "Pentraze", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "434ab2ca-b26c-3765-b1d5-a1aaf89e0569", "product": {"name": "Stash"}, "product_version": "0 \u2264build 303"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "62b70620-8269-3e7d-b6fa-cb1fc11b0c79", "vendor": {"name": "Stash"}}], "isExploited": false}
