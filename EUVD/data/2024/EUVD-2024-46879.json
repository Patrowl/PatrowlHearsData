This vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation and sanitization on both the frontend and backend components of the application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user input in the chat feature, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session. This issue affects all versions of the application. The impact of this vulnerability includes the potential for stolen credentials, extraction of sensitive information from chat logs, projects, and other data accessible through the application.", "datePublished": "2024-07-08T00:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:18:06", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/6c00ff84-574b-4b4f-bd58-aa7ec1809662", "https://github.com/stitionai/devika/commit/6acce21fb08c3d1123ef05df6a33912bf0ee77c2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5711"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c48ddfab-94a4-3fde-b1fa-462c2e78daa3", "product": {"name": "stitionai/devika"}, "product_version": "unspecified <-"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1196264b-5ace-35b3-9405-2f5b1d2ddd1d", "vendor": {"name": "stitionai"}}], "isExploited": false}
