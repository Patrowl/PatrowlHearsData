This flaw allows unauthenticated users to perform destructive actions on the VectorDB, including resetting the database and deleting specific namespaces, without requiring any authorization or permissions. The issue affects all versions up to and including the latest version, with a fix introduced in version 1.0.0. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to complete data loss of document embeddings across all workspaces, rendering workspace chats and embeddable chat widgets non-functional. Additionally, attackers can list all namespaces, potentially exposing private workspace names.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T17:32:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-03T18:27:21", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/8a98a0b4-7886-41c5-8624-fc5c21972e5a", "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/bf8df60c02b9ddc7ba682809ca12c5637606393a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3033"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66ee6f1a-7bee-3f11-a88d-e49a04780290", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f740734-1c31-3ee3-9d45-7fca94726f7f", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
