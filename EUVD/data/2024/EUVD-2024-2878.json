As of quinn-proto 0.11, it is possible for a server to `accept()`, `retry()`, `refuse()`, or `ignore()` an `Incoming` connection. However, calling `retry()` on an unvalidated connection exposes the server to a likely panic in the following situations:  1. Calling `refuse` or `ignore` on the resulting validated connection, if a duplicate initial packet is received. This issue can go undetected until a server's `refuse()`/`ignore()` code path is exercised, such as to stop a denial of service attack. 2. Accepting when the initial packet for the resulting validated connection fails to decrypt or exhausts connection IDs, if a similar initial packet that successfully decrypts and doesn't exhaust connection IDs is received. This issue can go undetected if clients are well-behaved. The former situation was observed in a real application, while the latter is only theoretical.", "datePublished": "2024-09-02T16:45:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T14:04:46", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/security/advisories/GHSA-vr26-jcq5-fjj8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45311", "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/commit/e01609ccd8738bd438d86fa7185a0f85598cb58f", "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn", "https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn/blob/bb02a12a8435a7732a1d762783eeacbb7e50418e/quinn-proto/src/endpoint.rs#L213", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0373.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45311", "GHSA-vr26-jcq5-fjj8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3785ef4-b55d-38c3-8483-ed0b51e8da9c", "product": {"name": "quinn"}, "product_version": "0.11.0, < 0.11.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a21de2f6-53b2-34db-b540-35ec9ff57ee8", "vendor": {"name": "quinn-rs"}}], "isExploited": false}
