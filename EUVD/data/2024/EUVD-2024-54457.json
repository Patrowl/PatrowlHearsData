Prior to version 4.8.2, `tls_wildcard_match()` matches on certificates such as `foo.*.bar` although that is not allowed. It is also possible to pass partial wildcards such as `foo.a*c.bar` which glib matches but should be avoided / invalidated. This issue could have an impact on TLS connections, such as in man-in-the-middle situations. Version 4.8.2 contains a fix for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-05-07T15:12:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-28T10:03:45", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-xr54-gx74-fghg", "https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/commit/dadfdbecde5bfe710b0a6ee5699f96926b3f9006", "https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/blob/b0ccc8952d333fbc2d97e51fddc0b569a15e7a7d/lib/transport/tls-verifier.c#L78-L110", "https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/releases/tag/syslog-ng-4.8.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47619"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5793d15c-5fc5-3429-b7e0-5f440f58068f", "product": {"name": "syslog-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.8.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a2a7658-9e22-306b-9aa8-f2b9f20cf339", "vendor": {"name": "syslog-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
