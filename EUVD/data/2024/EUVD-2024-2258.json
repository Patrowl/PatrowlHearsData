{"id": "EUVD-2024-2258", "enisaUuid": "3170b019-dda2-35cc-98de-a0301c9f386a", "description": "zot is an OCI image registry. Prior to 2.1.0, the cache driver `GetBlob()` allows read access to any blob without access control check. If a Zot `accessControl` policy allows users read access to some repositories but restricts read access to other repositories and `dedupe` is enabled (it is enabled by default), then an attacker who knows the name of an image and the digest of a blob (that they do not have read access to), they may maliciously read it via a second repository they do have read access to. \n This attack is possible because [`ImageStore.CheckBlob()` calls `checkCacheBlob()`](https://github.com/project-zot/zot/blob/v2.1.0-rc2/pkg/storage/imagestore/imagestore.go#L1158-L1159) to find the blob a global cache by searching for the digest. If it is found, it is copied to the user requested repository with `copyBlob()`. The attack may be mitigated by configuring \"dedupe\": false in the \"storage\" settings. The vulnerability is fixed in 2.1.0.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T18:48:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:33:11", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/project-zot/zot/security/advisories/GHSA-55r9-5mx9-qq7r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39897", "https://github.com/project-zot/zot/commit/aaee0220e46bdadd12115ac67c19f9d3153eb1df", "https://github.com/project-zot/zot"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39897", "GHSA-55r9-5mx9-qq7r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "11af04c1-9c80-38eb-8e22-1748d2e1e79a", "product": {"name": "zot"}, "product_version": "< 2.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a63c96ef-3e8f-3267-a38d-b1a549fff1e3", "vendor": {"name": "project-zot"}}], "isExploited": false}
