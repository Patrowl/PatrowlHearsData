When an HTTP request using TLS/1.3 early data on top of TCP Fast Open or QUIC 0-RTT packets is received and the IP-address-based access control is used, the access control does not detect and prohibit HTTP requests conveyed by packets with a spoofed source address. This behavior allows attackers on the network to execute HTTP requests from addresses that are otherwise rejected by the address-based access control. The vulnerability has been addressed in commit 15ed15a. Users may disable the use of TCP FastOpen and QUIC to mitigate the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-10-11T14:24:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-11T14:42:24", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/h2o/h2o/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2c-xjcp-wg4c", "https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/15ed15a2efb83a77bb4baaa5a119e639c2f6898a", "https://h2o.examp1e.net/configure/http3_directives.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45397"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c07d3746-694f-3a10-ba0b-35922d6fea50", "product": {"name": "H2O"}, "product_version": "< 15ed15a2efb83a77bb4baaa5a119e639c2f6898a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f2da968-122a-3834-8150-98cbc6f70b75", "vendor": {"name": "h2o"}}], "isExploited": false}
