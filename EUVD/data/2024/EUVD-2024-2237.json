The typescript SDK has no awareness of to-be-spent transactions causing some transactions to fail or silently get pruned as they are funded with already used UTXOs. The problem occurs, because the `fund` function in `fuels-ts/packages/account/src/account.ts` gets the needed ressources statelessly with the function `getResourcesToSpend` without taking into consideration already used UTXOs. This issue will lead to unexpected SDK behaviour, such as a transaction not getting included in the `txpool` / in a block or a previous transaction silently getting removed from the `txpool` and replaced with a new one.", "datePublished": "2024-07-30T19:42:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:54:31", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/security/advisories/GHSA-3jcg-vx7f-j6qf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41945", "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/commit/16ee1bfe66733551d00f0a76c21e8a09ea33006f", "https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41945", "GHSA-3jcg-vx7f-j6qf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e720855e-57a2-31e7-b7ac-e2e7b83cfdac", "product": {"name": "fuels-ts"}, "product_version": "< 0.93.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a6631231-5d8c-38f0-bf44-1090ee149f22", "vendor": {"name": "FuelLabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
