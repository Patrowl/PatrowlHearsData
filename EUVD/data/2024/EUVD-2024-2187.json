Specifically, the vulnerability is located in the `checkProjectAccess` method within the authorization middleware, which fails to adequately verify if a user has the correct permissions to access a specific project. Instead, it only checks if the user is part of the organization owning the project, overlooking the necessary check against the `account_project` table for explicit project access rights. This flaw enables attackers to gain complete control over all resources within a project, including the ability to create, update, read, and delete any resource, compromising the privacy and security of sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2024-06-08T19:41:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-30T15:28:58", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4146", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/c43b6c62035f32ca455f66d5fd22ba661648cde7", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary", "https://huntr.com/bounties/a749e696-b398-4260-b2d0-b0054b9fffa7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4146", "GHSA-w5xm-mx47-v7c8"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "79477173-1a7f-382a-958a-e93ac1922b2e", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.2.26"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d2d7c937-6d85-37ec-aa65-73239daed34c", "vendor": {"name": "lunary-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
