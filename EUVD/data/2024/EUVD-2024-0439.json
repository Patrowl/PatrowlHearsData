Prior to version 8.1.3, the isCleanHtml method is not used on this this form, which makes it possible to store a cross-site scripting payload in the database. The impact is low because the HTML is not interpreted in BO, thanks to twig's escape mechanism. In FO, the cross-site scripting attack is effective, but only impacts the customer sending it, or the customer session from which it was sent. This issue affects those who have a module fetching these messages from the DB and displaying it without escaping HTML. Version 8.1.3 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-01-02T21:17:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-14T19:10:16", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-vr7m-r9vm-m4wf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21628", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/afc45b93b3cc33be0e571559d2838c6960d98856", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/c3d78b7e49f5fe49a9d07725c3174d005deaa597", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21628", "GHSA-vr7m-r9vm-m4wf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0422ff3b-3efe-3656-8e89-c163c02c57a3", "product": {"name": "PrestaShop"}, "product_version": "< 8.1.3"}, {"id": "0ac7e438-d192-35f2-87ca-a7b00ca4f377", "product": {"name": "PrestaShop"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0ac7e438-d192-35f2-87ca-a7b00ca4f377", "vendor": {"name": "PrestaShop"}}], "isExploited": false}
