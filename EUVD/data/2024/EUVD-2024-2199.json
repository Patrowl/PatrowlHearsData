This vulnerability allows any remote user to view full paths in the entire file system where h2o-3 is hosted. Specifically, the issue resides in the Typeahead API call, which when requested with a typeahead lookup of '/', exposes the root filesystem including directories such as /home, /usr, /bin, among others. This vulnerability could allow attackers to explore the entire filesystem, and when combined with a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, could make exploitation of the server trivial.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T18:18:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T12:49:42", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5550", "https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3", "https://huntr.com/bounties/e76372c2-39be-4984-a7c8-7048a75a25dc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5550", "GHSA-x234-r5fg-x52m"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fd9bff4d-9cfa-348f-9522-c80c49c2f32b", "product": {"name": "h2oai/h2o-3"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ede0ac5a-1d4d-30f4-b8ab-cf70c8189ccf", "vendor": {"name": "h2oai"}}], "isExploited": false}
