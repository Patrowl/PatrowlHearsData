This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted style information into comments resulting in a possibility of data exfiltration such as admin nonces with limited impact. These nonces could be used to perform CSRF attacks within a limited time window. The presence of other plugins may make additional nonces available, which may pose a risk in plugins that don't perform capability checks to protect AJAX actions or other actions reachable by lower-privileged users.", "datePublished": "2024-10-12T08:41:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-15T15:07:56", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1fd0b13c-7447-45da-9608-80b7629d9bbf?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3158674%40stackable-ultimate-gutenberg-blocks%2Ftrunk&old=3156448%40stackable-ultimate-gutenberg-blocks%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8760"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1bfbd634-c63b-3900-927b-d60087b5a557", "product": {"name": "Stackable \u2013 Page Builder Gutenberg Blocks"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.13.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f1f5f2e-e4db-3967-b66a-b43b7528573a", "vendor": {"name": "bfintal"}}], "isExploited": false}
