By manipulating the ChatBot responses, an attacker can inject malicious scripts to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating a new admin account or changing the user's password, leading to a complete takeover of the AnythingLLM application. The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user and ChatBot input, specifically through the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Successful exploitation requires convincing an admin to add a malicious LocalAI ChatBot to their AnythingLLM instance.", "datePublished": "2024-04-10T17:08:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:12:07", "baseScore": 0.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/f0eaf552-aaf3-42b6-a5df-cfecd2de15ee", "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/a4ace56a401ffc8ce0082d7444159dfd5dc28834"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3570"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "863f8e60-6ae2-3990-8b71-5f62ce11cb52", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified <a4ace56a401ffc8ce0082d7444159dfd5dc28834"}, {"id": "f5e5720e-9d6e-32bc-bb92-216fcde7a850", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7205bd2e-961f-3685-9d15-e77986f1cbbe", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
