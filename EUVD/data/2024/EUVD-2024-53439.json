Based on the code analysis, it was determined that the /api/member/avatar API endpoint receives a base64 string as input. This string is then passed to the memberService.uploadAvatarByBase64 method for processing. Within the service, the base64-encoded image is parsed. For example, given a string like: data:image/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGltZyBzcmM9eCBvbmVycm9yPWFsZXJ0KDEpPjwvaHRtbD4= the content after the comma is extracted and decoded using Base64.getDecoder().decode(). The substring from the 11th character up to the first occurrence of a semicolon (;) is assigned to the suffix variable (representing the file extension). The decoded content is then written to a file. However, the file extension is not validated, and since this functionality is exposed to the frontend, it poses significant security risks.", "datePublished": "2025-01-06T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-14T20:50:37", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://gitee.com/liweiyi/ChestnutCMS", "https://www.1000mz.com/", "https://github.com/Zerone0x00/CVE/blob/main/ChestnutCMS/CVE-2024-56828.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56828"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4c31f239-77a3-3d4c-bfac-26e8b5e7fcf5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e616905-ed8d-3e64-967b-e918e9a93abd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
