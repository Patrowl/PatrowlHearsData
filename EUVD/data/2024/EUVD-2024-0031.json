Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to version 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key and an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`, then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has been resolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is properly raised.", "datePublished": "2024-02-21T07:15:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-06T02:34:24", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-6vqw-3v5j-54x4", "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/97d231672763cdb5959a3b191e692a362f1b9e55", "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/10423", "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/10423", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-26130"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-26130", "PYSEC-2024-225"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81362c07-62a4-31bb-a00c-44a57a9a2d02", "product": {"name": "cryptography"}}, {"id": "a33cf18e-6524-33c5-afbc-b4819a239b7c", "product": {"name": "cryptography"}, "product_version": "38.0.0, < 42.0.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e9870140-df08-3dbd-96dd-30ead3abbccc", "vendor": {"name": "pyca"}}], "isExploited": false}
