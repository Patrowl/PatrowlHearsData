When an HTTP smuggling request with an ASCII control character is sent, it causes the Netty HttpObjectDecoder to transition into a BAD_MESSAGE state. As a result, any subsequent legitimate requests on the same connection are ignored, leading to client timeouts, which may impact systems using load balancers and expose them to risk.", "datePublished": "2024-10-08T16:26:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T07:28:36", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9622", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9622", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317179", "https://github.com/orgs/resteasy/discussions/4351", "https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9622", "GHSA-5wpr-cj9p-959r"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2795fab-7392-3d40-bd32-ebb371f19be8", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
