A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the \"error\" event to catch these errors.\n", "datePublished": "2024-06-19T19:48:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T20:35:40", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/security/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38355", "https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/15af22fc22bc6030fcead322c106f07640336115", "https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d30630ba10562bf987f4d2b42440fc41a828119c", "https://github.com/socketio/socket.io"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-38355", "GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1417882f-fcc7-32f1-988e-5b90256f1ffe", "product": {"name": "socket.io"}, "product_version": "3.0.0,< 4.6.2"}, {"id": "4b19cd77-4e1e-38c4-aee5-f295ab6b5a94", "product": {"name": "socket.io"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "390285f9-5745-332e-992d-f00f49996c9d", "vendor": {"name": "socketio"}}], "isExploited": false}
