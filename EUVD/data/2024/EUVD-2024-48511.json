This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable when used in conjunction with a race condition as the uploaded file is deleted shortly after it is created.", "datePublished": "2024-09-07T11:17:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-09T15:04:28", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7600e7df-725d-4877-b0bf-5329f814723f?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3144365/customizer-export-import"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7620"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 6.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69109494-1909-3dfb-9983-f74708f0f399", "product": {"name": "Customizer Export/Import"}, "product_version": "* \u22640.9.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff032d4b-affd-3e7e-aadd-64aabac00395", "vendor": {"name": "justinbusa"}}], "isExploited": false}
