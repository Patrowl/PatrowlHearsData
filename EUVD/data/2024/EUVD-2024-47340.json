Poisoned password reset links can be sent to existing HaloITSM users (given their email address is known). When these poisoned links get accessed (e.g. manually by the victim or automatically by an email client software), the password reset token is leaked to the malicious actor, allowing them to set a new password for the victim's account.This potentially leads to account takeover attacks.HaloITSM versions past 2.146.1 (and patches starting from 2.143.61 ) fix the mentioned vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-08-06T06:03:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T18:47:20", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://haloitsm.com/guides/article/?kbid=2155"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6203"], "assigner": "NCSC.ch", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "258e62a1-cac7-384c-aede-707e85ab0993", "product": {"name": "HaloITSM"}, "product_version": "< 2.146.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dbc7dc6a-d91e-36e4-8051-9e7f2a143f44", "vendor": {"name": "Halo Service Solutions"}}], "isExploited": false}
