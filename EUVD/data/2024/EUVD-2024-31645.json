To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server. \n\nImportant: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which typically restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log in to the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.\n\nNote: This CVE has been split into two separate CVEs (CVE-2024-3037 and CVE-2024-8404) and it\u2019s been rescored with a \"Privileges Required (PR)\" rating of low, and \u201cAttack Complexity (AC)\u201d rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard users on the host server.", "datePublished": "2024-05-14T00:12:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-07T20:27:00", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Security-Bulletin-May-2024/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3037"], "assigner": "PaperCut", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6850bfac-33b8-395e-9bd6-4fdcd2f50b53", "product": {"name": "PaperCut NG, PaperCut MF"}, "product_version": "0 <23.0.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "babf5231-1a10-321e-bbe3-9cfcd1384e49", "vendor": {"name": "PaperCut"}}], "isExploited": false}
