In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.", "datePublished": "2024-04-04T22:10:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-26T20:27:25", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/security/advisories/GHSA-6cf6-8hvr-r68w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31206", "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/issues/3", "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/pull/4", "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/commit/3600d8ac156f27da553ac4ead46d16989a350105", "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts", "https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/dectalk-tts/blob/b3e92156cbb699218ac9b9c7d8979abd0e635767/src/index.ts#L18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-31206", "GHSA-6cf6-8hvr-r68w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "487a830a-613d-3500-bcec-51bc6a359f4c", "product": {"name": "dectalk-tts"}}, {"id": "6d806ccc-694f-3060-86f9-256a7ef4feaf", "product": {"name": "dectalk-tts"}, "product_version": "= 1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4398ea4-7da0-3cb2-86bb-c96e83104a22", "vendor": {"name": "JstnMcBrd"}}], "isExploited": false}
