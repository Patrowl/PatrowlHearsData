This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files and achieve remote code execution. This is essentially the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-5932, however, it was discovered the the presence of stripslashes_deep on user_info allows the is_serialized check to be bypassed. This issue was mostly patched in 3.16.1, but further hardening was added in 3.16.2.", "datePublished": "2024-09-28T02:04:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-30T15:11:42", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c4c530fa-eaf4-4721-bfb6-9fc06d7f343c?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/give/tags/3.16.0/includes/process-donation.php#L154", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149290/give/tags/3.16.1/includes/process-donation.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149290/give/tags/3.16.1/includes/admin/admin-actions.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3149290/give/tags/3.16.1/src/Helpers/Utils.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157829/give/tags/3.16.2/includes/process-donation.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8353"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 91.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d49b05ea-d450-3785-bc9c-f74f8ca12f1f", "product": {"name": "GiveWP \u2013 Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.16.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a4ce21e0-e9d4-3126-bcbd-29353a349877", "vendor": {"name": "webdevmattcrom"}}], "isExploited": false}
