RPKI manifests are listings of relevant files that clients are supposed to verify. Assuming everything else is correct, the most recent version of a manifest should be prioritized over other versions, to prevent replays, accidental or otherwise. Manifests contain the manifestNumber and thisUpdate fields, which can be used to gauge the relevance of a given manifest, when compared to other manifests. The former is a serial-like sequential number, and the latter is the date on which the manifest was created. However, the product does not compare the up-to-dateness of the most recently fetched manifest against the cached manifest. As such, it's prone to a rollback to a previous version if it's served a valid outdated manifest. This leads to outdated route origin validation.", "datePublished": "2024-12-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-26T19:07:44", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56170"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "becf94c0-5d6d-3fc9-a15b-46532d643141", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d2480bf9-d962-3dea-8b86-02a8badfbc81", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
