To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. \n\nImportant: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.\n\nNote: \n\nThis CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037.", "datePublished": "2024-09-26T01:42:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-26T15:01:21", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/Security-Bulletin-May-2024/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8404"], "assigner": "PaperCut", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03149dc8-ace7-3fc6-9178-4e88b9465552", "product": {"name": "PaperCut NG, PaperCut MF"}, "product_version": "0 <23.0.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "03db9311-85f7-30c6-affe-10a6ac94bfab", "vendor": {"name": "PaperCut"}}], "isExploited": false}
