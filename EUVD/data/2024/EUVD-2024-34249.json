This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the adforest_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-01-08T08:18:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T14:07:34", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4ebb766a-44e9-460c-be84-356b7403e593?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/adforest-classified-wordpress-theme/19481695"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11350"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8992c728-b697-30c0-99e9-f2747b7d2499", "product": {"name": "AdForest"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.1.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4bce04bc-191f-34d7-896e-84623e1a1894", "vendor": {"name": "scriptsbundle"}}], "isExploited": false}
