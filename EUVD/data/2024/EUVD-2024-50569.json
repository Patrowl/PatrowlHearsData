This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2024-12-21T07:02:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-28T00:51:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/29d72347-ba49-45c6-a964-2c75064ac866?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/smsa-shipping-official/trunk/smsa-express-shipping.php#L235"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12066"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 3.73, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fe5fbc3-7949-395f-9c03-a805a7799de7", "product": {"name": "SMSA Shipping(official)"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c2ed88e-56c5-36c9-b436-33e1e19e99b0", "vendor": {"name": "smsaexpress"}}], "isExploited": false}
