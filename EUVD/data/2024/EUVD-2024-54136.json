This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change plugin access privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation allows attackers with subscriber-level privileges and above to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "datePublished": "2025-03-08T11:16:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-11T16:07:21", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4a4c085a-1601-4c1a-ac17-0f2cf5d02489?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3225040/vikrentcar"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11640"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ad25eab-f796-36a6-bf36-c271410eb30d", "product": {"name": "VikRentCar Car Rental Management System"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "654c86b6-46a3-336d-91b1-c38278a345c1", "vendor": {"name": "e4jvikwp"}}], "isExploited": false}
