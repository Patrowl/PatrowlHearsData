Starting in version 1.36.2 and prior to version 1.40.3, use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution. Use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions. This bug is known to be exploitable for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations. Version 1.40.3 fixes this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-03-06T20:56:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T19:24:42", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf", "https://github.com/denoland/deno"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27934", "GHSA-3j27-563v-28wf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b3185cd-d669-34e5-a258-79aa18676894", "product": {"name": "deno"}}, {"id": "951247b8-ba3d-3104-9968-d4571423437f", "product": {"name": "deno"}, "product_version": "1.36.2, < 1.40.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "afcdc1d3-e4dc-32c1-bfa6-a63ea6cd4c25", "vendor": {"name": "denoland"}}], "isExploited": false}
