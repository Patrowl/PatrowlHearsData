It seems to be largely the same binary as used by the Iocharger Pedestal charging station, however. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted> binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a crafted HTTP request.\n\nImpact: Critical \u2013 The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete\nfiles and services.\n\nCVSS clarification: Any network interface serving the web ui is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are not additional security measures to circumvent (AC:L), nor does the attack require and existing preconditions (AT:N). The attack is authenticated, but the level of authentication does not matter (PR:L), nor is any user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H), and compromised devices can be used to pivot into networks that should potentially not be accessible (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Becuase this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P). This attack can be automated (AU:Y).", "datePublished": "2025-01-09T07:56:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-09T14:33:30", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:H/S:P/AU:Y", "references": ["https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2024-00035/", "https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2024-43654/", "https://iocharger.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43654"], "assigner": "DIVD", "epss": 2.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1b677f31-bda4-32d9-926e-21e61e5dce78", "product": {"name": "Iocharger firmware for AC models"}, "product_version": "0 <25010801"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7fa4ad1c-8ef8-3d0a-b537-fd744636050e", "vendor": {"name": "Iocharger"}}], "isExploited": false}
