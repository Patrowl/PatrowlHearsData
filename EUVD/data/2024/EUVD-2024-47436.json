This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'options_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T07:38:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:33:05", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e11f1a56-d5a2-47a4-a5cc-34345966495a?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/scrollto-top/trunk/scrollto-top.php?rev=662578#L238"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6320"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 2.89, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "baf266c7-c56c-3682-99c6-0844f3d2c19e", "product": {"name": "ScrollTo Top"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "255ff71a-7f88-3e5c-82c9-bd3cc82fee76", "vendor": {"name": "dwieeb"}}], "isExploited": false}
