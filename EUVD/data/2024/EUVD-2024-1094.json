Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.", "datePublished": "2024-04-04T20:37:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T18:17:43", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288", "https://go.dev/cl/576155", "https://go.dev/issue/65051", "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT", "https://nowotarski.info/http2-continuation-flood-technical-details", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45288", "GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m"], "assigner": "Go", "epss": 66.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "43f52525-33f4-3463-a7be-003435de6933", "product": {"name": "golang.org/x/net/http2"}, "product_version": "0 <0.23.0"}, {"id": "9eee714e-9503-3bc8-af69-941701d2c427", "product": {"name": "net/http"}, "product_version": "1.22.0-0 <1.22.2"}, {"id": "e438dbef-46d9-3dda-92c1-174a2e5bd634", "product": {"name": "net/http"}, "product_version": "0 <1.21.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "124aa946-ba02-357d-9e35-03cf37e66f13", "vendor": {"name": "Go standard library"}}, {"id": "50ad56f3-9901-3936-9234-e43de056511a", "vendor": {"name": "golang.org/x/net"}}], "isExploited": false}
