Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating snapshot files to include symlinks, leading to arbitrary file read by adding a symlink that points to a desired file on the filesystem and arbitrary file write by including a symlink and a payload file in the snapshot's directory structure. This vulnerability allows for the reading and writing of arbitrary files on the server, which could potentially lead to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version v1.9.0.", "datePublished": "2024-06-03T10:05:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T12:50:23", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3829", "https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/commit/ee7a31ec3459a6a4219200234615c1817ab82260", "https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-client", "https://huntr.com/bounties/abd9c906-75ee-4d84-b76d-ce1386401e08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3829", "GHSA-7m75-x27w-r52r"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "67849bbe-5795-34d6-9eb2-ceaa96af3655", "product": {"name": "qdrant/qdrant"}, "product_version": "unspecified <v1.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16085a49-40a6-3240-a2ed-5f3e680e0ee8", "vendor": {"name": "qdrant"}}], "isExploited": false}
