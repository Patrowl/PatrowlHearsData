In addition, instructions to execute \nbinaries to finalize the repair process are included.\u00a0The executables are executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\" after they are \ncopied over to the user writable installation folder (C:\\Elefant1). This\n means that a user can overwrite either \"PostESUUpdate.exe\" or \n\"Update_OpenJava.exe\" in the time frame after the copy and before the \nexecution of the final repair step. The overwritten executable is then executed as \"NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".", "datePublished": "2024-11-08T12:15:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T22:28:29", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed", "https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50592", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Nov/3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-50592"], "assigner": "SEC-VLab", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "91c9cbc1-b2f7-38b9-85e8-a2efc1fd0b7b", "product": {"name": "Elefant Software Updater"}, "product_version": "<1.4.2.1811"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c2fd135-0743-3a95-9866-95337d8ff0a1", "vendor": {"name": "HASOMED"}}], "isExploited": false}
