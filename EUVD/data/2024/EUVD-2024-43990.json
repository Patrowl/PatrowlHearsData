This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services. Due to the complex nature of protecting against DNS rebind attacks in WordPress software, we settled on the developer simply restricting the usage of the URL import functionality to just administrators. While this is not optimal, we feel this poses a minimal risk to most site owners and ideally WordPress core would correct this issue in wp_safe_remote_get() and other functions.", "datePublished": "2024-06-07T05:33:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:40:47", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/879384eb-bfea-4667-a7de-9f723dbea74b?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tablepress/trunk/classes/class-import.php#L125", "https://www.clear-gate.com/blog/ssrf-with-dns-rebinding-2/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tablepress/trunk/classes/class-import.php#L141", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3097113%40tablepress&new=3097113%40tablepress&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4354"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e10deb0c-a852-34f2-9c55-b46cac9b86c1", "product": {"name": "TablePress \u2013 Tables in WordPress made easy"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0c4e139d-e20c-3972-8ca8-af1f1db03b2d", "vendor": {"name": "tobiasbg"}}], "isExploited": false}
