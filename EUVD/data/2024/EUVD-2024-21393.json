This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 chargers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of base64-encoded data within WebSocket messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.\n\nWas ZDI-CAN-23230", "datePublished": "2024-09-28T06:12:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-03T13:41:52", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-24-853/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-23967"], "assigner": "ASRG", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e12e7587-ee60-3b30-aa44-fac9fdfbc1b4", "product": {"name": "MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50"}, "product_version": "1.32.00"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8b28c128-6f93-3f8e-b931-5fa9d8bcad2f", "vendor": {"name": "Autel"}}], "isExploited": false}
