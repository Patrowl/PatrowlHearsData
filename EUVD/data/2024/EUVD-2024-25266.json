Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-03-06T21:15:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T00:48:49", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/security/advisories/GHSA-fqh6-v4qp-65fv", "https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens/commit/c595a1f884b986da2ca05aa5bff9ae5f93c6a4aa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-28111"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "95f0bba9-6714-310c-95e7-91a2fcba0e22", "product": {"name": "canarytokens"}}, {"id": "c36931d9-333e-3c83-a688-81de6761f4d8", "product": {"name": "canarytokens"}, "product_version": "< sha-c595a1f8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c179b94f-6b65-3ecd-bc2f-45449fb298ca", "vendor": {"name": "thinkst"}}], "isExploited": false}
