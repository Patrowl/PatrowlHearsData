A theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the https://cke4.ckeditor.com domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. The issue impacts only editor instances with enabled version notifications. Please note that this feature is disabled by default in all CKEditor 4 LTS versions. Therefore, if you use CKEditor 4 LTS, it is highly unlikely that you are affected by this vulnerability. If you are unsure, please contact us. The fix is available in version 4.25.0-lts.", "datePublished": "2024-08-21T15:17:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-22T13:51:02", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-6v96-m24v-f58j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43411", "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/commit/b5069c9cb769ea22eae1cbd7200f22b1cf2e3a7f", "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43411", "GHSA-6v96-m24v-f58j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e7015fca-fbea-3e1b-8302-af0476852b9c", "product": {"name": "ckeditor4"}, "product_version": "4.22.0, < 4.25.0-lts"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5edaa99c-6dd2-3a89-8635-acdc4f61d75e", "vendor": {"name": "ckeditor"}}], "isExploited": false}
