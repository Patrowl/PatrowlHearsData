The part of trunk which verifies whether a user has a real email address on signup used a rfc-822 library which executes a shell command to validate the email domain MX records validity. It works via an DNS MX. This lookup could be manipulated to also execute a command on the trunk server, effectively giving root access to the server and the infrastructure. This issue was patched server-side with commit 001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3 in September 2023. This RCE triggered a full user-session reset, as an attacker could have used this method to write to any Podspec in trunk.", "datePublished": "2024-07-01T20:42:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:04:25", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/security/advisories/GHSA-x2x4-g675-qg7c", "https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk-RCEs-2023", "https://evasec.webflow.io/blog/eva-discovered-supply-chain-vulnerabities-in-cocoapods#2-remote-code-execution-on-the-cocoapods-trunk-server"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-38366"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 58.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "343e13eb-dfb6-3f64-9034-1d6b90b47de7", "product": {"name": "CocoaPods"}, "product_version": "< 001cc3a430e75a16307f5fd6cdff1363ad2f40f3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3edee87c-8340-34fb-8ce0-49108029828e", "vendor": {"name": "CocoaPods"}}], "isExploited": false}
