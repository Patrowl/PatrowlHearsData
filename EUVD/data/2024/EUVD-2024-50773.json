This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and preventing the browser preview for MIME type image/svg+xml. This issue was first reported in CVE-2022-30110. However, it was still possible to do a browser preview of a SVG file by sending a manipulated MIME type during the upload, where the case of any letter in image/svg+xml had been changed (like image/svg+XML). The check for image/svg+xml has been changed to be case insensitive.", "datePublished": "2024-12-06T20:50:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-30T14:51:38", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://gitlab.com/jirafeau/Jirafeau/-/commit/6cfca8753d54e2025c6020b2af32529e25f58c66", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30110"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12326"], "assigner": "GitLab", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ed5d12ad-4f1d-3c1a-974f-f42770cbe351", "product": {"name": "Jirafeau"}, "product_version": "4.5.0 <4.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "deba08ff-f03b-3ad9-9204-8a8efb6db741", "vendor": {"name": "Jirafeau project"}}], "isExploited": false}
