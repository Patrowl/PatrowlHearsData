{"id": "EUVD-2024-0067", "enisaUuid": "54aed53b-89d0-3bb1-98f6-3533cf0eadba", "description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability involves a **timing attack** in the way Gradio compares hashes for the `analytics_dashboard` function. Since the comparison is not done in constant time, an attacker could exploit this by measuring the response time of different requests to infer the correct hash byte-by-byte. This can lead to unauthorized access to the analytics dashboard, especially if the attacker can repeatedly query the system with different keys. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to mitigate this issue. To mitigate the risk before applying the patch, developers can manually patch the `analytics_dashboard` dashboard to use a **constant-time comparison** function for comparing sensitive values, such as hashes. Alternatively, access to the analytics dashboard can be disabled.", "datePublished": "2024-10-11T02:15:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-19T06:22:57", "baseScore": 2.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-j757-pf57-f8r4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47869", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gradio/PYSEC-2024-199.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47869", "GHSA-j757-pf57-f8r4", "PYSEC-2024-199"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ec85fb62-fe5b-30a7-a2cc-3d232e06bc30", "product": {"name": "gradio"}, "product_version": "< 4.44"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f7c8167-9e73-3aa1-a769-0be575c8644e", "vendor": {"name": "gradio-app"}}], "isExploited": false}
