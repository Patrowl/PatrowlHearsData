Red Hat has made a claim that there is a security risk within Red Hat products. NLnet Labs has no further information about the claim, and suggests that affected Red Hat customers refer to available Red Hat documentation or support channels. ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION: A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function in Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.", "datePublished": "2024-08-08T20:24:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T22:04:57", "baseScore": 2.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-43167", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2303456", "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/issues/1072", "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/unbound/pull/1073/files", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-43167", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/09/msg00046.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/16/6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43167"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "182b924d-db83-3c8e-832e-a3942db4a13a", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
