This is due to insufficient verification on the user being returned by the social login token. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, if they have access to the email and the user does not have an already-existing account for the service returning the token. An attacker cannot authenticate as an administrator by default, but these accounts are also at risk if authentication for administrators has explicitly been allowed via the social login.", "datePublished": "2024-11-06T06:43:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-19T17:42:12", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6b1d212b-75fe-4285-9c22-62b040e5a36c?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3177729/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-10020"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "891978c6-8e53-36c8-a051-33dea3fff36d", "product": {"name": "Heateor Social Login WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1.35"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3eae120c-4fbe-3479-a9bb-2ea894825367", "vendor": {"name": "heateor"}}], "isExploited": false}
