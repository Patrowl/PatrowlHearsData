This is due to the plugin not properly checking for an empty token value prior to resetting a user's password through the dwt_listing_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-06-27T08:23:57", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-27T13:31:54", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/51fc7d47-2a0f-4713-9859-120321aa32dc?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/dwt-listing-directory-listing-wordpress-theme/21976132"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12827"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "be5da488-7b83-3414-8bd1-2144493782ac", "product": {"name": "DWT - Directory & Listing WordPress Theme"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.3.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39269b76-173e-3447-939e-88ae620d13a1", "vendor": {"name": "scriptsbundle"}}], "isExploited": false}
