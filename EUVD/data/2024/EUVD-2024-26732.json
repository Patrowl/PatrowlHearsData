The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users should upgrade to 2.1.4\n\nBackground info:\n\nLog in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the \"Build Argument\". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character \"`\". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.\n\nIn the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.", "datePublished": "2024-07-17T08:21:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:47:42", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread/xhx7jt1t24s6d7o435wxng8t0ojfbfh5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/17/2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29737", "https://github.com/apache/streampark"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-29737"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c18baca8-61fa-34f4-aead-8f51debcac9e", "product": {"name": "Apache StreamPark (incubating)"}, "product_version": "2.0.0 <2.1.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87457e0f-4753-39f1-9f20-9d32eeb589aa", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
