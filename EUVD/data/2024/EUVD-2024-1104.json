{"id": "EUVD-2024-1104", "enisaUuid": "9403a237-ec6e-3eb4-86e4-7f88feedf90a", "description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the mlflow/mlflow repository, specifically within the artifact deletion functionality. Attackers can bypass path validation by exploiting the double decoding process in the `_delete_artifact_mlflow_artifacts` handler and `local_file_uri_to_path` function, allowing for the deletion of arbitrary directories on the server's filesystem. This vulnerability is due to an extra unquote operation in the `delete_artifacts` function of `local_artifact_repo.py`, which fails to properly sanitize user-supplied paths. The issue is present up to version 2.9.2, despite attempts to fix a similar issue in CVE-2023-6831.", "datePublished": "2024-04-16T00:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-09T20:00:20", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1560", "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow", "https://huntr.com/bounties/4a34259c-3c8f-4872-b178-f27fbc876b98"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1560", "GHSA-5mvj-wmgj-7q8c"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7f0f75c7-66da-3b0a-9cd6-4adcbe800e32", "product": {"name": "mlflow/mlflow"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}, {"id": "d76ce9cc-ce57-3a8e-b07c-5bb027b1f38b", "product": {"name": "mlflow/mlflow"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fdc681c5-f0f3-39aa-9bfe-6324762a2845", "vendor": {"name": "mlflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
