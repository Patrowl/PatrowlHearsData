{"id": "EUVD-2024-1482", "enisaUuid": "fffebd46-b66d-30e0-bd2d-6c54e087ca26", "description": "Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.", "datePublished": "2024-05-09T16:07:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T02:51:11", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-77r5-gw3j-2mpf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34350", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/44eba020c615f0d9efe431f84ada67b81576f3f5", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/compare/v13.5.0...v13.5.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-34350", "GHSA-77r5-gw3j-2mpf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f175e9fe-6838-3e7a-adae-a3d6e79818c3", "product": {"name": "next.js"}, "product_version": "13.4.0, < 13.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa92b68a-9e26-30b1-ac72-5874a8fa67d3", "vendor": {"name": "vercel"}}], "isExploited": false}
