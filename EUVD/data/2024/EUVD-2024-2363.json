In affected versions the two gRPC ports 7070 and 7071, are not bound to [localhost](http://localhost/) by default, so when TorchServe is launched, these two interfaces are bound to all interfaces. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected. This issue in TorchServe has been fixed in PR #3083. TorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-07-18T22:40:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T15:59:53", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pytorch/serve/security/advisories/GHSA-hhpg-v63p-wp7w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35199", "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3083", "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/commit/aab99506a17193de217aacc1119d9381dbc6ed2b", "https://github.com/pytorch/serve", "https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.11.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-35199", "GHSA-hhpg-v63p-wp7w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e7c07f3b-678c-34ee-9270-6e182b1d4301", "product": {"name": "serve"}, "product_version": "0.3.0, < 0.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d24a5705-4236-3fc5-ad59-1bccb46a00df", "vendor": {"name": "pytorch"}}], "isExploited": false}
