In affected versions sessions are still usable even though their lifetime has exceeded. Kanboard implements a cutom session handler (`app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php`), to store the session data in a database. Therefore, when a `session_id` is given, kanboard queries the data from the `sessions` sql table. At this point, it does not correctly verify, if a given `session_id` has already exceeded its lifetime (`expires_at`).\nThus, a session which's lifetime is already `> time()`, is still queried from the database and hence a valid login. The implemented **SessionHandlerInterface::gc** function, that does remove invalid sessions, is called only **with a certain probability** (_Cleans up expired sessions. Called by `session_start()`, based on `session.gc_divisor`, `session.gc_probability` and `session.gc_maxlifetime` settings_) accordingly to the php documentation. In the official Kanboard docker image these values default to: session.gc_probability=1, session.gc_divisor=1000. Thus, an expired session is only terminated with probability 1/1000. This issue has been addressed in release 1.2.43 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-12-18T23:52:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-20T20:12:10", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/security/advisories/GHSA-gv5c-8pxr-p484", "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/7ce61c34d962ca8b5dce776289ddf4b207be6e78", "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/blob/main/app/Core/Session/SessionHandler.php#L40", "https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php", "https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-divisor", "https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-maxlifetime", "https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.gc-probability", "https://www.php.net/manual/en/sessionhandlerinterface.gc.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55603"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29e57f8b-0126-3595-a2e6-192aafa23ff2", "product": {"name": "kanboard"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.43"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dc3b8815-621a-3803-89e9-79759fdb7718", "vendor": {"name": "kanboard"}}], "isExploited": false}
