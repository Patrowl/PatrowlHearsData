{"id": "EUVD-2024-49698", "enisaUuid": "23db5792-1242-30a8-ac24-0121e8a0c54a", "description": "The The WP Popup Builder \u2013 Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via the wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.3.5 with a nonce check, which effectively prevented access to the affected function. However, version 1.3.6 incorporates the correct authorization check to prevent unauthorized access.", "datePublished": "2024-10-16T07:31:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-16T18:02:58", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0cac1dc0-87dc-43eb-9db1-638a91200b43?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3166506/wp-popup-builder"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9061"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 88.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c47ef3c-afac-326f-97d6-4cca6f7a8591", "product": {"name": "WP Popup Builder \u2013 Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.3.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86d0f0e6-20b8-3a2e-b95a-c24a55f3ec53", "vendor": {"name": "ThemeHunk"}}], "isExploited": false}
