This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This is only exploitable when lower-level users have been granted access to submit specific forms, which is disabled by default.", "datePublished": "2024-12-14T08:26:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-16T16:40:53", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/69a464f4-c357-446f-a5b8-0919d9af56c9?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3204192%40acf-frontend-form-element&new=3204192%40acf-frontend-form-element&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file32"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11720"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c6279241-f873-359e-899e-5607b784092b", "product": {"name": "Frontend Admin by DynamiApps"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.24.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7d3e83f-fee9-3944-9073-169258840616", "vendor": {"name": "shabti"}}], "isExploited": false}
