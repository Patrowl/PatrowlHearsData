In 1.15.0 and earlier, an open CORS policy in app.js may allow an attacker to view the images of home-gallery when it is using the default settings. The following express middleware allows any website to make a cross site request to home-gallery, thus allowing them to read any endpoint on home-gallery. Home-gallery is mostly safe from cross-site requests due to most of its pages requiring JavaScript, and cross-site requests such as fetch() do not render javascript. If an attacker is able to get the path of the preview images which are randomized, an attacker will be able to view such a photo. If any static files or endpoints are introduced in the future that contain sensitive information, they will be accessible to an attacker website.", "datePublished": "2024-12-23T17:13:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-18T21:48:40", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-091_GHSL-2024-092_home-gallery/", "https://github.com/xemle/home-gallery/blob/v1.15.0/packages/server/src/app.js#L45"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-53276"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ad37558-6336-3439-868b-92d02ff995e8", "product": {"name": "home-gallery"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.15.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4d3509bc-b91e-36c4-9a71-07c11e78375f", "vendor": {"name": "xemle"}}], "isExploited": false}
