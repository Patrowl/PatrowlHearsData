The issue\nonly arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the server, and the\nserver, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of an X.509 certificate\nchain.  The affected clients are those that then rely on the handshake to\nfail when the server's RPK fails to match one of the expected public keys,\nby setting the verification mode to SSL_VERIFY_PEER.\n\nClients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that raw\npublic key verification failed by calling SSL_get_verify_result(), and those\nthat do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.  This issue was\nintroduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in OpenSSL 3.2.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-02-11T15:59:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-18T14:01:55", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250211.txt", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/738d4f9fdeaad57660dcba50a619fafced3fd5e9", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/87ebd203feffcf92ad5889df92f90bb0ee10a699", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/798779d43494549b611233f92652f0da5328fbe7", "https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/security/advisories/GHSA-79v4-65xg-pq4g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12797", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/11/3", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/11/4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12797"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12897f7b-a511-3025-be2e-afd416883288", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.4.0 <3.4.1"}, {"id": "24d66b91-0367-33e1-8949-c035a189d326", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.2.0 <3.2.4"}, {"id": "563d5186-c476-3def-b5bc-d3b86debc933", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.3.0 <3.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d9c06f03-61ec-30e3-8051-22c63cad3681", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
