Users invited as \"App Viewer\" should not have access to development information of a workspace. Datasources are such a component in a workspace. Yet, in versions of Appsmith prior to 1.51, app viewers are able to get a list of datasources in a workspace they're a member of. This information disclosure does NOT expose sensitive data in the datasources, such as database passwords and API Keys. The attacker needs to have been invited to a workspace as a \"viewer\", by someone in that workspace with access to invite. The attacker then needs to be able to signup/login to that Appsmith instance. The issue is patched in version 1.51. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2025-03-25T14:15:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-25T14:44:39", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/security/advisories/GHSA-794x-gm8v-2wj6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55604"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e131c159-8443-33ee-8f00-c296990b9bbc", "product": {"name": "appsmith"}, "product_version": "< 1.51"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "244ff230-1ffa-3775-993b-786e89247b61", "vendor": {"name": "appsmithorg"}}], "isExploited": false}
