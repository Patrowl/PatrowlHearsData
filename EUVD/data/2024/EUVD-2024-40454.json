A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-09-02T16:21:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T14:18:32", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-gg56-vj58-g5mc", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf-ghsa-gg56-vj58-g5mc/pull/1", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1c0d6e9c670ebb1b6f1e427a4c4d9250a7fb9b80/server/controllers/LibraryController.js#L43-L47"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43797"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f190d729-2b0b-3be2-8257-03a49fbdd4dc", "product": {"name": "audiobookshelf"}, "product_version": "< 2.13.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0e2f5f50-3258-3985-aa2a-a074633608e8", "vendor": {"name": "advplyr"}}], "isExploited": false}
