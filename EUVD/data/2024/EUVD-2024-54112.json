This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to (1) performing a post-booking auto-login or (2) updating their profile details (e.g. password). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to (1) login as an arbitrary user if their email address is known or (2) change an arbitrary user's password, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-03-19T11:10:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-19T13:37:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/827b5482-cb42-4aaa-80b5-3d0143fcead8?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13442"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "572c4032-8dd1-3677-b8d1-ab597ca3aafd", "product": {"name": "Service Finder Bookings"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "97372df2-7eb3-3251-a97a-1dfe2d632407", "vendor": {"name": "aonetheme"}}], "isExploited": false}
