The program attempts to reallocate the memory pointed to by stream->samples to accommodate stream->n_samples + samples_count elements of type QtDemuxSample. The problem is that samples_count is read from the input file. And if this value is big enough, this can lead to an integer overflow during the addition. As a consequence, g_try_renew might allocate memory for a significantly smaller number of elements than intended. Following this, the program iterates through samples_count elements and attempts to write samples_count number of elements, potentially exceeding the actual allocated memory size and causing an OOB-write. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.", "datePublished": "2024-12-11T18:51:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:39:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-094_Gstreamer/", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8059.patch", "https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0005.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47537"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f536dc1-5caa-32c2-9613-cc0f792d6caf", "product": {"name": "GStreamer"}, "product_version": "< 1.24.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b110b680-346b-30ad-8eff-3811800ba152", "vendor": {"name": "GStreamer"}}], "isExploited": false}
