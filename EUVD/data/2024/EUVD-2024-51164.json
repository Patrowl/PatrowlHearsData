This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain allows attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server that makes remote code execution possible. Please note this was only partially patched in 3.19.3, a fully sufficient patch was not released until 3.19.4. However, another CVE was assigned by another CNA for version 3.19.3 so we will leave this as affecting 3.19.2 and before. We have recommended the vendor use JSON encoding to prevent any further deserialization vulnerabilities from being present.", "datePublished": "2025-01-11T07:21:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-13T17:12:05", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b2143edf-5423-4e79-8638-a5b98490d292?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3212723/give/tags/3.19.3/src/Helpers/Utils.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12877"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 32.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cbc0b565-08b5-3a9d-95da-ee41bb97ed30", "product": {"name": "GiveWP \u2013 Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.19.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2d4bde6e-a38c-3985-9d2e-38b12e103e7c", "vendor": {"name": "webdevmattcrom"}}], "isExploited": false}
