Although the Referer header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [&], [<], [>], [\"], [']), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)// payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the target user\u2019s browser, compromising user sessions.", "datePublished": "2024-02-17T05:00:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T18:53:52", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21496", "https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security/issues/267", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGREENPAUCADDYSECURITY-6249860", "github.com/greenpau/caddy-security", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21496", "GHSA-ff72-ff42-c3gw"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3ab71f6b-36f4-3d79-9231-6dbdd776f1af", "product": {"name": "github.com/greenpau/caddy-security"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8dbea7f1-c6aa-3acd-ac39-3e4a03acf41b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
