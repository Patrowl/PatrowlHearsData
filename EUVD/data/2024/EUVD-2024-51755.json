This is due to the plugin not properly requiring re-verification after a booking has been made and a change is being attempted. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate their confirmed bookings, even after they have been approved.", "datePublished": "2025-02-12T07:35:38", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-18T17:40:48", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8a0b961e-ccc3-4da0-b007-bbafa133a3a8?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3234469%40booking&new=3234469%40booking&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file20", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13821"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13821"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17a5b46a-828b-301f-babb-c5c9d06bdb4c", "product": {"name": "WP Booking Calendar"}, "product_version": "* \u226410.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7c837ab2-c7f3-3d67-acb9-c4f87d35ed54", "vendor": {"name": "wpdevelop"}}], "isExploited": false}
