This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-01-31T02:24:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-31T19:36:34", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/23c89d9f-8958-4333-8604-54173c31efac?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/live-2d/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13767"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3196e333-9182-3549-9e8b-1965b2962e8b", "product": {"name": "Live2DWebCanvas"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.9.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0633e0dc-d3be-3dd8-a901-41d5f9c6bb7d", "vendor": {"name": "jiangweifang"}}], "isExploited": false}
