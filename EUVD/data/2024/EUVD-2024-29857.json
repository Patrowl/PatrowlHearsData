In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-04-12T20:33:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-06T17:58:36", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/advisories/GHSA-pmhq-4cxq-wj93", "https://github.com/netdata/netdata/pull/17377"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32019"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fd0e142-a25a-3dd1-bcb6-b8fba5c60169", "product": {"name": "netdata"}, "product_version": "1.44.0-60, < 1.45.0-169"}, {"id": "b59212c7-a589-3b7c-b79c-239e98f82870", "product": {"name": "netdata"}}, {"id": "ceac2adb-d4bf-36d4-8939-ff82dc9c4df9", "product": {"name": "netdata"}, "product_version": "1.45.0, < 1.45.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b59212c7-a589-3b7c-b79c-239e98f82870", "vendor": {"name": "netdata"}}], "isExploited": false}
