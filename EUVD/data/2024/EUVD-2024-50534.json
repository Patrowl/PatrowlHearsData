Both the SHA-1 hash of the password as well as the session tokens are included as part of the URL and therefore exposed to information leakage scenarios. An attacker capable of accessing such values (e.g., victim browser, network traffic inspection) can exploit this vulnerability to leak both the password hash as well as session tokens and bypass the authentication mechanism using a pass-the-hash attack.", "datePublished": "2025-02-13T16:01:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:53:38", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nozominetworks.com/labs/vulnerability-advisories-cve-2024-12012", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12012"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12012"], "assigner": "Nozomi", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17fd2e34-b74f-3cca-ba5b-578ed4e97c55", "product": {"name": "130.8005"}, "product_version": "12h"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7da84686-08e4-3a99-b49b-7c0433fbf955", "vendor": {"name": "Zettler"}}], "isExploited": false}
