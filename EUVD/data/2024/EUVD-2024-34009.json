This is due to the 'authenticate_user' user function not implementing sufficient null value checks when setting the access token and user information. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first user who has signed in using Google OAuth, which could be the site administrator.", "datePublished": "2024-12-12T03:23:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-12T16:27:37", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/afe894b0-5e91-4aa2-bbd1-1f74274701cf?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/sign-in-with-google/trunk/src/admin/class-sign-in-with-google-admin.php#L525"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11015"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a45ab6a-559b-3e8a-8336-a993cffc09c0", "product": {"name": "Sign In With Google"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b850b286-95c9-39ac-b803-ba346fdaa878", "vendor": {"name": "tarecord"}}], "isExploited": false}
