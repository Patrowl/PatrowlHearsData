The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of artifact URLs, where a '#' character can be used to insert a path into the fragment, effectively skipping validation. This allows an attacker to construct a URL that, when processed, ignores the protocol scheme and uses the provided path for filesystem access. As a result, an attacker can read arbitrary files, including sensitive information such as SSH and cloud keys, by exploiting the way the application converts the URL into a filesystem path. The issue stems from insufficient validation of the fragment portion of the URL, leading to arbitrary file read through path traversal.", "datePublished": "2024-05-16T09:15:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-08T10:23:25", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3848", "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/f8d51e21523238280ebcfdb378612afd7844eca8", "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow", "https://huntr.com/bounties/8d5aadaa-522f-4839-b41b-d7da362dd610"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3848", "GHSA-rfqq-wq6w-72jm"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 73.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb426002-257e-3122-9971-08f622cd60b4", "product": {"name": "mlflow/mlflow"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.12.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f2acfca-4aa5-3bb8-8944-3270248b01c8", "vendor": {"name": "mlflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
