An Use-After-Free read vulnerability has been discovered affecting the processing of CodecPrivate elements in Matroska streams. In the GST_MATROSKA_ID_CODECPRIVATE case within the gst_matroska_demux_parse_stream function, a data chunk is allocated using gst_ebml_read_binary. Later, the allocated memory is freed in the gst_matroska_track_free function, by the call to g_free (track->codec_priv). Finally, the freed memory is accessed in the caps_serialize function through gst_value_serialize_buffer. The freed memory will be accessed in the gst_value_serialize_buffer function. This results in a UAF read vulnerability, as the function tries to process memory that has already been freed. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.", "datePublished": "2024-12-11T19:18:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:40:55", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-280_Gstreamer/", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8057.patch", "https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0030.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47834"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c1863cf-b66e-3525-a238-789083c9571b", "product": {"name": "GStreamer"}, "product_version": "< 1.24.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6724d244-cd93-39c6-ae2a-68c9faa27bd2", "vendor": {"name": "GStreamer"}}], "isExploited": false}
