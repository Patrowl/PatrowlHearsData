A SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the the \"Add News\" functionality due to improper escaping of the email address. This allows any authenticated user with the rights to add/edit FAQ news to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data, take over accounts and in some cases, even achieve RCE. The vulnerable field lies in the  `authorEmail` field which uses PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter. This filter is insufficient in protecting against SQL injection attacks and should still be properly escaped. However, in this version of phpMyFAQ (3.2.5), this field is not escaped properly can be used together with other fields to fully exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.2.6.", "datePublished": "2024-03-25T18:26:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T00:28:00", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-qgxx-4xv5-6hcw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27299", "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/1b68a5f89fb65996c56285fa636b818de8608011", "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFL8GHIBxSUxu0TneYf66KjFA0A4RZga?usp=sharing", "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27299", "GHSA-qgxx-4xv5-6hcw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.87, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8d2dcf3-485d-3ed7-ba3a-6c030945311d", "product": {"name": "phpMyFAQ"}}, {"id": "ce3fa491-58cc-30ed-8dfb-e36d4be40772", "product": {"name": "phpMyFAQ"}, "product_version": "3.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ed23d794-8efc-3573-9fc4-456c3094566c", "vendor": {"name": "thorsten"}}], "isExploited": false}
