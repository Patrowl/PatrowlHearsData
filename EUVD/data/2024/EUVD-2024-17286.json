This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files through the 'lang' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4, and fully patched in 7.2.5.", "datePublished": "2024-03-21T03:32:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:10:01", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/57cc15a6-2cf5-481f-bb81-ada48aa74009?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3051451/wp-file-manager"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1538"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 4.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a9fe8f4-2d97-3d42-96fe-ee458b876abf", "product": {"name": "File Manager"}, "product_version": "* \u22647.2.4"}, {"id": "3dd70869-a5db-3de0-85b8-53bb46ac93f9", "product": {"name": "File Manager"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "929f4e4d-1c19-34c3-987d-5935eddb1f9b", "vendor": {"name": "mndpsingh287"}}], "isExploited": false}
