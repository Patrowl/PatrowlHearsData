A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`.", "datePublished": "2024-02-02T15:28:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T23:28:12", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6", "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/087481ac12bfa5dd715f3630f0b1697be94f7e88"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24760"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4098402a-c741-3eca-9471-45bcddcbcaaf", "product": {"name": "mailcow-dockerized"}, "product_version": "< 2024-01c"}, {"id": "bb09e51d-b7a3-3763-a1c0-82330f4aa95f", "product": {"name": "mailcow-dockerized"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8749c29a-79ac-3711-9269-f25afdf0e2c9", "vendor": {"name": "mailcow"}}], "isExploited": false}
