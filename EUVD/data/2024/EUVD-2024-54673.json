Since Rocket.Chat was not signed with the Hardened Runtime nor set to enforce Library Validation, it is vulnerable to DYLIB injection attacks, which can lead to unauthorized actions or escalation of permissions. Consequently, an attacker gains capabilities that are not permitted by default under the Sandbox and its application profile.", "datePublished": "2025-06-10T23:22:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-11T13:49:40", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://pentraze.com/", "https://pentraze.com/vulnerability-reports/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8270"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8270"], "assigner": "Pentraze", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f8e7f553-c5ce-3eb6-a1c9-ae006d8614bc", "product": {"name": "Rocket.Chat Desktop"}, "product_version": "0 \u22644.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b75d7e04-fadb-3d20-b19d-ed8fba47729a", "vendor": {"name": "Rocket.Chat"}}], "isExploited": false}
