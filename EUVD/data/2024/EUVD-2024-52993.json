RPKI Relying Parties (such as Fort) are supposed to maintain a backup cache of the remote RPKI data. This can be employed as a fallback in case a new fetch fails or yields incorrect files. However, the product currently uses its cache merely as a bandwidth saving tool (because fetching is performed through deltas). If a fetch fails midway or yields incorrect files, there is no viable fallback. This leads to incomplete route origin validation data.", "datePublished": "2024-12-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T22:14:44", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nicmx.github.io/FORT-validator/CVE.html", "https://github.com/NICMx/FORT-validator/issues/82", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56169"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56169"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a8f121f-db9d-365d-91b4-49ec78b62934", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f21e31c5-c8aa-33ab-a29c-0b2a20b0f1b2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
