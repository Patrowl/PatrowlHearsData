{"id": "EUVD-2024-0064", "enisaUuid": "f4a76d34-7d20-3690-affa-0af61cef5598", "description": "Gradio is an open-source Python package designed for quick prototyping. This vulnerability is related to **CORS origin validation**, where the Gradio server fails to validate the request origin when a cookie is present. This allows an attacker\u2019s website to make unauthorized requests to a local Gradio server. Potentially, attackers can upload files, steal authentication tokens, and access user data if the victim visits a malicious website while logged into Gradio. This impacts users who have deployed Gradio locally and use basic authentication. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>4.44` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually enforce stricter CORS origin validation by modifying the `CustomCORSMiddleware` class in their local Gradio server code. Specifically, they can bypass the condition that skips CORS validation for requests containing cookies to prevent potential exploitation.", "datePublished": "2024-10-11T01:15:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-19T06:22:57", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-3c67-5hwx-f6wx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47084", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gradio/PYSEC-2024-196.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47084", "GHSA-3c67-5hwx-f6wx", "PYSEC-2024-196"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d430325-0c69-3b23-9cb6-e864733a59af", "product": {"name": "gradio"}, "product_version": "< 4.44"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2bc2719c-2ac9-39c1-bd87-9c8bc868e417", "vendor": {"name": "gradio-app"}}], "isExploited": false}
