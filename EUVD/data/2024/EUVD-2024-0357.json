The [`verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) workflow returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution. This could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such as `;` which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a `run` block. By running custom commands, an attacker may be able to steal secrets such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than `pull_request`.\n\nThis has been patched in versions [17](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17) and [17.0.0](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17.0.0) by enabling `safe_output` by default and returning filename paths escaping special characters for bash environments.", "datePublished": "2023-12-29T17:08:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T22:48:12", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/security/advisories/GHSA-ghm2-rq8q-wrhc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52137", "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/commit/498d3f316f501aa72485060e8c96fde7b2014f12", "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files/commit/592e305da041c09a009afa4a43c97d889bed65c3", "https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-52137", "GHSA-ghm2-rq8q-wrhc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3e817fd8-b831-3cb9-a705-39b13ab65110", "product": {"name": "verify-changed-files"}, "product_version": "< 17.0.0"}, {"id": "9a2b0406-153d-30d3-9e6c-221f53a9fdf4", "product": {"name": "verify-changed-files"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c253e91-690d-3d97-80a9-a435998056f1", "vendor": {"name": "tj-actions"}}], "isExploited": false}
