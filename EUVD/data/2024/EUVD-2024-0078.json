{"id": "EUVD-2024-0078", "enisaUuid": "adf8216f-1095-3ef1-ae9d-7941a5c956d9", "description": "Indico is an event management system that uses Flask-Multipass, a multi-backend authentication system for Flask. In Indico prior to version 3.3.4, corresponding to Flask-Multipass prior to version 0.5.5, there is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability during account creation when redirecting to the `next` URL. Exploitation requires initiating the account creation process with a maliciously crafted link, and then finalizing the signup process. Because of this, it can only target newly created (and thus unprivileged) Indico users. Indico 3.3.4 upgrades the dependency on Flask-Multipass to version 0.5.5, which fixes the issue. Those who build the Indico package themselves and cannot upgrade can update the `flask-multipass` dependency to `>=0.5.5` which fixes the vulnerability. Otherwise one could configure one's web server to disallow requests containing a query string with a `next` parameter that starts with `javascript:`.", "datePublished": "2024-09-04T11:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T09:23:55", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/indico/indico/security/advisories/GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff", "https://github.com/indico/flask-multipass/commit/0bdcf656d469e5f675cb56fd644d82fea3a97c2a", "https://github.com/indico/indico/commit/7dcb573837b9fd09d95f74d1baeae225b164cc8f", "https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45399", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/indico/PYSEC-2024-90.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45399", "GHSA-rrqf-w74j-24ff", "PYSEC-2024-90"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1584f0fa-fbce-34ae-9ed3-d6f4ca826afa", "product": {"name": "indico"}, "product_version": "< 3.3.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "afae7e51-16af-381c-9f22-0818a5b93318", "vendor": {"name": "indico"}}], "isExploited": false}
