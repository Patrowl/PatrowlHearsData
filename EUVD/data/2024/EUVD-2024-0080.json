Prior to versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0, if a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user. The impact is relatively small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users.\\nIn effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended. Note that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional. Versions 4.1.6 and 5.1.0 fix this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-08-08T06:15:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-19T06:22:58", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4q-3gxw-849f", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/99e2720b0fc626cbeeca3c6337f917fdacfaa428", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/commit/ff2db557a85b6980f90c3158634bf924063ab8ba", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41942", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/jupyterhub/PYSEC-2024-200.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41942", "GHSA-9x4q-3gxw-849f", "PYSEC-2024-200"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "65a3ec51-257b-3ceb-9e69-b510ba108a8e", "product": {"name": "jupyterhub"}, "product_version": "< 4.1.6"}, {"id": "f46011c7-014b-3183-8772-99fef25a4510", "product": {"name": "jupyterhub"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "413f9219-b57e-3e07-b8a0-eb4309bdc6ed", "vendor": {"name": "jupyterhub"}}], "isExploited": false}
