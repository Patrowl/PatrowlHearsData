The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted zip file that leads to an infinite loop. This issue also impacts the zipfile module of CPython, as features from the third-party zipp library are later merged into CPython, and the affected code is identical in both projects. The infinite loop can be initiated through the use of functions affecting the `Path` module in both zipp and zipfile, such as `joinpath`, the overloaded division operator, and `iterdir`. Although the infinite loop is not resource exhaustive, it prevents the application from responding. The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.19.1 of jaraco/zipp.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T00:00:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T12:50:27", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5569", "https://github.com/jaraco/zipp/commit/fd604bd34f0343472521a36da1fbd22e793e14fd", "https://github.com/jaraco/zipp", "https://huntr.com/bounties/be898306-11f9-46b4-b28c-f4c4aa4ffbae"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5569", "GHSA-jfmj-5v4g-7637"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6f92d99f-08e7-3976-8cc0-81eff090fdde", "product": {"name": "jaraco/zipp"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.19.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "abfef43a-c98f-3534-b359-0cac185b29c4", "vendor": {"name": "jaraco"}}], "isExploited": false}
