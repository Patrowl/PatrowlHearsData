This gives anyone with network access to a cobbler server full control of the server. Versions 3.2.3 and 3.3.7 fix the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T16:33:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-18T18:24:07", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/security/advisories/GHSA-m26c-fcgh-cp6h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47533", "https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/32c5cada013dc8daa7320a8eda9932c2814742b0", "https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/e19717623c10b29e7466ed4ab23515a94beb2dda", "https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47533", "GHSA-m26c-fcgh-cp6h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 53.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4e3ea20d-6f07-39b9-8660-105a57ce9065", "product": {"name": "cobbler"}, "product_version": "3.3.0, < 3.3.7"}, {"id": "b1f152ba-66de-3b45-ad9b-f26e80fffa16", "product": {"name": "cobbler"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9c02f80-4e4c-3907-bd7b-4b03d8d5ae46", "vendor": {"name": "cobbler"}}], "isExploited": false}
