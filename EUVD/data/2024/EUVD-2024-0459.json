In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-01-31T21:31:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-15T16:02:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21626", "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/02120488a4c0fc487d1ed2867e901eeed7ce8ecf", "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc", "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.12", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00005.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2NLXNE23Q5ESQUAI22Z7A63JX2WMPJ2J", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYMO3BANINS6RGFQFKPRG4FIOJ7GWYTL", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/176993/runc-1.1.11-File-Descriptor-Leak-Privilege-Escalation.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/01/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/02/3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYMO3BANINS6RGFQFKPRG4FIOJ7GWYTL/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2NLXNE23Q5ESQUAI22Z7A63JX2WMPJ2J/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21626", "GHSA-xr7r-f8xq-vfvv"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 5.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5c9d0bb8-ee16-3222-b592-809f884e2464", "product": {"name": "runc"}}, {"id": "feb3a661-44b6-3f4e-bd90-e3e09f60a75e", "product": {"name": "runc"}, "product_version": "v1.0.0-rc93, < 1.1.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36b4db3c-4032-35b0-b491-1791c351be4c", "vendor": {"name": "opencontainers"}}], "isExploited": false}
