Prior to version 6.3.23, XSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. This issue has been patched in release 6.3.23. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2024-09-06T15:46:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-06T16:56:17", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/security/advisories/GHSA-59rq-22fm-x8q5", "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/security/advisories/GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45294", "https://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/releases/tag/1.6.22", "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core", "https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/releases/tag/6.3.23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45294", "GHSA-6cr6-ph3p-f5rf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "60b82861-f77f-398b-8e2c-94fb7af68f1a", "product": {"name": "org.hl7.fhir.core"}, "product_version": "< 6.3.23"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7efd0529-cfa9-3bad-a943-904cc6957889", "vendor": {"name": "hapifhir"}}], "isExploited": false}
