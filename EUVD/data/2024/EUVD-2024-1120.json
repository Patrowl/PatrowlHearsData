This functionality is intended to only be available to individuals with the permission to write/edit to the snapshot in question, but due to a bug in the authorization logic, deletion requests issued by an unprivileged user in a different organization than the snapshot owner are treated as authorized.\n\nGrafana Labs would like to thank Ravid Mazon and Jay Chen of Palo \nAlto Research for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability.\n\nThis issue affects Grafana: from 9.5.0 before 9.5.18, from 10.0.0 before 10.0.13, from 10.1.0 before 10.1.9, from 10.2.0 before 10.2.6, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.5.", "datePublished": "2024-03-26T17:24:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:27:36", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/grafana/bugbounty/security/advisories/GHSA-67rv-qpw2-6qrr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1313", "https://github.com/grafana/grafana", "https://grafana.com/security/security-advisories/cve-2024-1313", "https://grafana.com/security/security-advisories/cve-2024-1313/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240524-0008/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1313", "GHSA-67rv-qpw2-6qrr"], "assigner": "GRAFANA", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "48186466-03ca-355b-af4d-508cdd1a3c58", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "10.3.0 <10.3.5"}, {"id": "55bc2e04-4548-3282-9a43-1fb204a00b31", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}}, {"id": "687df597-ff89-3547-ae6c-c416ad7f9d73", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "10.2.0 <10.2.6"}, {"id": "e0e02fd7-7c88-3109-a4e5-0e6ead8ba0f6", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "10.1.0 <10.1.9"}, {"id": "e283f1c7-06ad-33a4-ad0f-4cfa4a07a797", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "10.0.0 <10.0.13"}, {"id": "f23fc783-a05f-35fb-9357-162b2b5f9f04", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "9.5.0 <9.5.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "55bc2e04-4548-3282-9a43-1fb204a00b31", "vendor": {"name": "Grafana"}}], "isExploited": false}
