Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called \"double dots\", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-01-22T23:00:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T22:59:32", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/honojs/node-server/security/advisories/GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23340", "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/commit/dd9b9a9b23e3896403c90a740e7f1f0892feb402", "https://github.com/honojs/node-server", "https://github.com/honojs/node-server/blob/8cea466fd05e6d2e99c28011fc0e2c2d3f3397c9/src/request.ts#L43-L45"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-23340", "GHSA-rjq5-w47x-x359"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19148a48-b4f4-3d7e-9636-3974716aa89f", "product": {"name": "node-server"}, "product_version": "1.3.0, < 1.4.1"}, {"id": "e4ff4587-54fd-3351-b8dd-732a0a351b5e", "product": {"name": "node-server"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bb0108de-0f89-38fc-a60e-f7d67d9eaf3c", "vendor": {"name": "honojs"}}], "isExploited": false}
