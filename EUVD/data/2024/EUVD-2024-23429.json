Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.", "datePublished": "2024-02-21T22:35:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-22T13:27:05", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/security/advisories/GHSA-fh6g-gvvp-587f", "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/pull/1412", "https://github.com/pinterest/querybook/commit/bc620dabaaf13ff1dcb30af0b46a490403fb9908"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-26148"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c55dd73e-3a59-362d-af42-9fcbbc6bc695", "product": {"name": "querybook"}}, {"id": "f4443ca1-42dc-3150-8253-e0127e21e3b9", "product": {"name": "querybook"}, "product_version": "< 3.31.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71eac20c-f008-3bdd-aab3-6165cd0bc1ca", "vendor": {"name": "pinterest"}}], "isExploited": false}
