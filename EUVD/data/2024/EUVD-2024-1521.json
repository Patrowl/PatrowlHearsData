A git authentication issue in versions prior to 0.16.10 allows a local user\u2019s GitHub token to be sent to remote servers other than `github.com`. Most git-dependent functionality in wolfictl relies on its own `git` package, which contains centralized logic for implementing interactions with git repositories. Some of this functionality requires authentication in order to access private repositories. A central function `GetGitAuth` looks for a GitHub token in the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` and returns it as an HTTP basic auth object to be used with the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library. Most callers (direct or indirect) of `GetGitAuth` use the token to authenticate to github.com only; however, in some cases callers were passing this authentication without checking that the remote git repository was hosted on github.com. This behavior has existed in one form or another since commit 0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0 - committed January 25, 2023. This impacts anyone who ran the `wolfictl check update` commands with a Melange configuration that included a `git-checkout` directive step that referenced a git repository not hosted on github.com. This also impacts anyone who ran `wolfictl update <url>` with a remote URL outside of github.com. Additionally, these subcommands must have run with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable set to a valid GitHub token. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.10 to receive a patch.", "datePublished": "2024-05-15T21:24:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:07:46", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/security/advisories/GHSA-8fg7-hp93-qhvr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35183", "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/0d06e1578300327c212dda26a5ab31d09352b9d0", "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/commit/403e93569f46766b4e26e06cf9cd0cae5ee0c2a2", "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl", "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/488b53823350caa706de3f01ec0eded9350c7da7/pkg/update/update.go#L143", "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/4dd6c95abb4bc0f9306350a8601057bd7a92bded/pkg/update/deps/cleanup.go#L49", "https://github.com/wolfi-dev/wolfictl/blob/6d99909f7b1aa23f732d84dad054b02a61f530e6/pkg/git/git.go#L22"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-35183", "GHSA-8fg7-hp93-qhvr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b14fb1c4-9db2-37b1-bfbb-fb941aa44ca5", "product": {"name": "wolfictl"}, "product_version": "< 0.16.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4562fa07-cc07-3067-8c19-c4079188d714", "vendor": {"name": "wolfi-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
