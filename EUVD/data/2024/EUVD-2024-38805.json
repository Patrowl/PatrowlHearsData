These jobs can be configured to run pre- and post-scripts, which can be located on a network share and are executed with elevated privileges by default. The user can update a job and schedule it to run almost immediately, allowing arbitrary code execution on the server.", "datePublished": "2024-12-04T01:06:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-13T17:40:27", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.veeam.com/kb4693"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-40717"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bff2dd73-ed7e-34f8-99e7-ba1c52e25be0", "product": {"name": "Backup & Replication"}, "product_version": "12.2 \u226412.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0ef6c7eb-0047-3f08-bbd8-a7500032cdd9", "vendor": {"name": "Veeam"}}], "isExploited": false}
