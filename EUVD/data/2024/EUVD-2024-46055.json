In version 2024.04 and prior, the function `_parse_advertise`, located in `/sys/net/application_layer/dhcpv6/client.c`, has no minimum header length check for `dhcpv6_opt_t` after processing `dhcpv6_msg_t`. This omission could lead to an out-of-bound read, causing system inconsistency. Additionally, the same lack of a header length check is present in the function `_preparse_advertise`, which is called by `_parse_advertise` before handling the request. As of time of publication, no known patched version exists.", "datePublished": "2024-11-22T15:41:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-25T18:07:14", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-xgv3-pcq6-qmrg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52802"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "df25b242-0220-38e3-976d-cb126053a028", "product": {"name": "RIOT"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2024.04"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ce4f37b9-c353-3786-970d-b6cd1dfe2a6c", "vendor": {"name": "RIOT-OS"}}], "isExploited": false}
