A vulnerability in SecureProps version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and contains special characters such as `\\n`. As a result, the decryption process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the encrypted data to be returned in plain format.  The vulnerability affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection logic.  This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since `TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.", "datePublished": "2024-03-18T21:49:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T00:56:58", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/security/advisories/GHSA-rj29-j2g4-77q8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28864", "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/issues/20", "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/pull/21", "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props/commit/ab7b561040cd37fda3dbf9a6cab01fefcaa16627", "https://github.com/IlicMiljan/Secure-Props"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-28864", "GHSA-rj29-j2g4-77q8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b4503c13-0ea7-3097-a8a4-1ba266f9d530", "product": {"name": "Secure-Props"}}, {"id": "e2294199-7bbc-3e05-9c26-fee401d5c026", "product": {"name": "Secure-Props"}, "product_version": "1.2.0, < 1.2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e80475c3-0415-3d09-8f5b-77cb85d93897", "vendor": {"name": "IlicMiljan"}}], "isExploited": false}
