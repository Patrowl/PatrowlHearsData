When a role-based access control (RBAC) object in Pulp is set to assign permissions on its creation, it uses the `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` (typically the add_roles_for_object_creator method). This method finds the object creator by checking the current authenticated user. For objects that are created within a task, this current user is set by the first user with any permissions on the task object. This means the oldest user with model/domain-level task permissions will always be set as the current user of a task, even if they didn't dispatch the task. Therefore, all objects created in tasks will have their permissions assigned to this oldest user, and the creating user will receive nothing.", "datePublished": "2024-08-07T16:49:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T20:56:36", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7143", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6765", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7143", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2300125", "https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore", "https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/blob/93f241f34c503da0fbac94bdba739feda2636e12/pulpcore/tasking/_util.py#L108"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7143", "GHSA-9m5j-4xx9-44j9"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39896598-e6d0-31f3-b5f7-74b8818fdd96", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
