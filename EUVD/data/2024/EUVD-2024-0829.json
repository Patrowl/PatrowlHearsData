Much like GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53, it is possible to find which usernames exist in vantage6 by calling the API routes `/recover/lost` and `/2fa/lost`. These routes send emails to users if they have lost their password or MFA token. This issue has been addressed in commit `aecfd6d0e` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-03-14T18:47:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-26T15:21:53", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53", "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-5h3x-6gwf-73jm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24770", "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/aecfd6d0e83165a41a60ebd52d2287b0217be26b", "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24770", "GHSA-5h3x-6gwf-73jm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34347a57-dfee-3fa0-9ce0-20d26cb7581d", "product": {"name": "vantage6"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.2.2"}, {"id": "be2a276c-c8be-36c7-aceb-02d89acd88c4", "product": {"name": "vantage6"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be2a276c-c8be-36c7-aceb-02d89acd88c4", "vendor": {"name": "vantage6"}}], "isExploited": false}
