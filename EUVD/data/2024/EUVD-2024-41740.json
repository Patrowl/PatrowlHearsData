For example, a request to a.com/ containing an Authorization header which is redirected to b.com/ will not send that header to b.com. In the event that the client received a subsequent same-domain redirect, however, the sensitive headers would be restored. For example, a chain of redirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization header to b.com/2.", "datePublished": "2025-01-28T01:03:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-18T18:41:11", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://go.dev/cl/643100", "https://go.dev/issue/70530", "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/CAWXhan3Jww/m/bk9LAa-lCgAJ", "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/bG8cv1muIBM/m/G461hA6lCgAJ", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3420", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45336", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0003"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45336"], "assigner": "Go", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "065bc0ae-5244-370f-a544-a00a2cb049d3", "product": {"name": "net/http"}, "product_version": "0 <1.22.11"}, {"id": "6135c573-4e9d-3b82-8046-53224b5ecd4c", "product": {"name": "net/http"}, "product_version": "1.24.0-0 <1.24.0-rc.2"}, {"id": "794aa46f-a54d-36c7-ab51-da54fb32d4be", "product": {"name": "net/http"}, "product_version": "1.23.0-0 <1.23.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "924c2b6e-db72-3727-8f79-a2df0c2265b5", "vendor": {"name": "Go standard library"}}], "isExploited": false}
