This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PPM files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
