This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T07:38:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:33:05", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/52cce49b-49b3-49b0-9f18-4829f07a420f?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/generate-pdf-using-contact-form-7/tags/4.0.6/inc/templates/cf7-pdf-generation.admin.html.php#L72"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6316"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 2.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4bc8e90d-6a7f-3e55-9664-7e9bc20d0a12", "product": {"name": "Generate PDF using Contact Form 7"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.0.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "365025be-926a-302e-8ff4-ab1f36a51930", "vendor": {"name": "zealopensource"}}], "isExploited": false}
