The `_on_rd_init()` function does not implement a size check before copying data to the `_result_buf` static buffer. If an attacker can craft a long enough payload, they could cause a buffer overflow. If the unchecked input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has yet to be patched. Users are advised to add manual bounds checking.", "datePublished": "2024-05-01T06:13:58", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:47:52", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-2572-7q7c-3965", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/sys/net/application_layer/cord/lc/cord_lc.c#L218", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/07/3", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/May/7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-31225"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10d9756d-3cb9-3628-8f61-927b037cb6fa", "product": {"name": "RIOT"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2023.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e3c346c2-127c-3fc5-bf4e-ea965f0d249e", "vendor": {"name": "RIOT-OS"}}], "isExploited": false}
