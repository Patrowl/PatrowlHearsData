A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by starting a back-up or restore process, which\u00a0temporarily exposes private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, and database folders when they are temporarily copied to an interim folder. This vulnerability is due to the lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder.
