Starting in version 0.16.0 and prior to version 0.18.0, an attacker may be able to remotely read arbitrary files without authentication due to a path traversal vulnerability. Users who exposed the Sunshine configuration web user interface outside of localhost may be affected, depending on firewall configuration. To exploit vulnerability, attacker could make an http/s request to the `node_modules` endpoint if user exposed Sunshine config web server to internet or attacker is on the LAN. Version 0.18.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may block access to Sunshine via firewall.", "datePublished": "2024-04-05T14:59:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:46:04", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/security/advisories/GHSA-6rg7-7m3w-w5wc", "https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases/tag/v0.18.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-31220"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9266859c-8f62-353c-ae1f-d86ad76d7006", "product": {"name": "Sunshine"}, "product_version": "0.16.0, < 0.18.0"}, {"id": "e7e1346e-aab4-3eec-a848-0b08b971e5f4", "product": {"name": "Sunshine"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "99eabffc-99a2-3d11-8bb9-f2881f2072f6", "vendor": {"name": "LizardByte"}}], "isExploited": false}
