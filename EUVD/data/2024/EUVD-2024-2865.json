Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin.", "datePublished": "2024-09-25T13:27:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-01T21:20:44", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45613", "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5", "https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v43.1.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45613", "GHSA-rgg8-g5x8-wr9v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e86ec162-50b4-38e3-86ce-6aceabce51c0", "product": {"name": "ckeditor5"}, "product_version": "40.0.0, < 43.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3e96f149-0cac-39b6-be23-56408acbfe9f", "vendor": {"name": "ckeditor"}}], "isExploited": false}
