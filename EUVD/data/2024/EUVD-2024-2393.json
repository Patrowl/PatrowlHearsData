Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a ThirdPartyBlock request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it, which includes the public key of the previous block (used in the signature) and the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions). A third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.", "datePublished": "2024-08-01T22:03:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:49:52", "baseScore": 3.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit-rust/security/advisories/GHSA-p9w4-585h-g3c7", "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit/security/advisories/GHSA-rgqv-mwc3-c78m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41949", "https://github.com/biscuit-auth/biscuit-rust"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41949", "GHSA-p9w4-585h-g3c7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "edb1a6fb-8866-36bf-a2fa-0ff1ce834f5f", "product": {"name": "biscuit-rust"}, "product_version": "< 5.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4dccf158-0f4b-383c-bdb0-8323faf5f9e2", "vendor": {"name": "biscuit-auth"}}], "isExploited": false}
