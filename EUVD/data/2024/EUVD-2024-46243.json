In affected versions missing validation in `ApRequestService.signedGet` and `HttpRequestService.getActivityJson` allows an attacker to create fake user profiles and forged notes. The spoofed users will appear to be from a different instance than the one where they actually exist, and the forged notes will appear to be posted by a different user. Vulnerable Misskey instances will accept the spoofed objects as valid, allowing an attacker to impersonate other users and instances. The attacker retains full control of the spoofed user / note and can interact like a real account. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-12-18T19:20:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-19T17:08:34", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-m2gq-69fp-6hv4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52591"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9a97cafb-36b1-312f-9a7a-6966ff6d4991", "product": {"name": "misskey"}, "product_version": "< 2024.11.0-alpha.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2ce9982-c2b6-38f1-b36c-9d09bcfc1032", "vendor": {"name": "misskey-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
