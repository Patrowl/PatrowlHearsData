The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation to check if a user is still part of an organization before allowing them to make changes. An attacker can exploit this by using an old authorization token to send a PATCH request, modifying the organization's name even after being removed from the organization. This issue is due to incorrect synchronization and affects the orgs.patch route.", "datePublished": "2024-04-10T17:08:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:56:22", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/e536310e-abe7-4585-9cf6-21f77390a5e8", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/d8e2e73efd53ab4e92cf47bbf4b639a9f08853d2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1902"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "32b4dcfb-59fb-3f42-8d34-78029bd17d91", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.2.8"}, {"id": "a7c558fe-4a2d-320c-8273-b3e3763df763", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6cc111cb-46cb-32d7-a5b6-ad27d54b0cca", "vendor": {"name": "lunary-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
