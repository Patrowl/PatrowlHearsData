This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. These actions may result in form deletion, and lead signup as well as file upload.", "datePublished": "2024-05-02T16:52:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:40:21", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d8ce9ab4-d6d6-4e06-a042-145db02cf7ba?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lead-form-builder/trunk/inc/ajax-functions.php#L674", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lead-form-builder/trunk/inc/ajax-functions.php#L21", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/lead-form-builder/trunk/inc/lf-install.php#L57"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1415"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6d5a3f26-11b4-3ef3-b64c-22ba5755c23e", "product": {"name": "Responsive Contact Form Builder & Lead Generation Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a0a8bf08-d7c4-335d-8c72-0e569bac5903", "vendor": {"name": "ThemeHunk"}}], "isExploited": false}
