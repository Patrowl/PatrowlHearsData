In versions prior to 1.0.9, XML parsing performed by the UcumEssenceService is vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where ucum is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML. Release 1.0.9 of Ucum-java fixes this vulnerability. As a workaround, ensure that the source xml for instantiating UcumEssenceService is trusted.", "datePublished": "2024-12-13T16:08:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-13T17:06:54", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java/security/advisories/GHSA-w9j7-phm3-f97j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-55887", "https://github.com/FHIR/Ucum-java"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55887", "GHSA-w9j7-phm3-f97j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2893281c-269c-341b-9370-98823ff7f57f", "product": {"name": "Ucum-java"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e11edea5-d527-3a86-acf7-6b55167e392b", "vendor": {"name": "FHIR"}}], "isExploited": false}
