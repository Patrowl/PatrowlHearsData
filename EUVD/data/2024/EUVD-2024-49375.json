This is due to a lack of proper checks to ensure lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-09-26T10:59:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-26T13:01:50", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ce2b4f93-93a6-480f-a877-ca47bd133bb6?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/file-manager-advanced/trunk/application/class_fma_main.php#L24", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/file-manager-advanced/trunk/application/class_fma_shortcode.php#L28", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3157713/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8725"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1e0b5c30-faaf-34cb-96b5-4b389da98b63", "product": {"name": "Advanced File Manager"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4886b33a-c300-3cf0-832f-fd593b818a5a", "vendor": {"name": "modalweb"}}], "isExploited": false}
