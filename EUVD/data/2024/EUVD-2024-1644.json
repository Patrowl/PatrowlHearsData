In versions 0.8.1 and prior, the unsafe handling of symbolic links in an unpacking routine may \nenable attackers to read and/or write to arbitrary locations outside the\n designated target folder.\u00a0The routine `untarFile` attempts to guard against creating symbolic links that point outside the directory a tar archive is extracted to. However, a malicious tarball first linking `subdir/parent` to `..` (allowed, because `subdir/..` falls within the archive root) and then linking `subdir/parent/escapes` to `..` results in a symbolic link pointing to the tarball\u2019s parent directory, contrary to the routine\u2019s goals. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write (with same permissions as the program running the unpack operation) if the attacker can control the archive file. Additionally, if the attacker has read access to the unpacked files, they may be able to read arbitrary system files the parent process has permissions to read. As of time of publication, no patch for this issue is available.\n", "datePublished": "2024-05-14T20:22:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:04", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26312", "https://github.com/dotmesh-io/dotmesh", "https://github.com/dotmesh-io/dotmesh/blob/master/pkg/archiver/tar.go#L255", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-254-zipslip-dotmesh", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2020-254-zipslip-dotmesh/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26312", "GHSA-hf54-fq2m-p9v6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e10e983f-9874-3ca6-9d02-1059e2253f8d", "product": {"name": "dotmesh"}, "product_version": "0 \u22640.8.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86a43d4c-ba5b-3306-ad7b-c0bc7571ec77", "vendor": {"name": "dotmesh-io"}}], "isExploited": false}
