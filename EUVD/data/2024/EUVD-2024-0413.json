The revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being \"not revoked\" when in fact, the holder's credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.", "datePublished": "2024-01-16T21:44:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T22:27:35", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa/security/advisories/GHSA-r78f-4q2q-hvv4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21670", "https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21670", "GHSA-r78f-4q2q-hvv4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "129d8009-bf53-3c13-9cdb-951bfbfb089a", "product": {"name": "ursa"}}, {"id": "f6c48930-4372-372c-9f19-ebd76f04a5de", "product": {"name": "ursa"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.3.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "223f06e1-96da-3d14-a4c2-22902432ba75", "vendor": {"name": "hyperledger-archives"}}], "isExploited": false}
