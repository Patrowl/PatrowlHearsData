This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Sheets integration credentials within the plugin's settings. Because the 'client_id' parameter is not sanitized or escaped when used in output, this vulnerability could also be leveraged to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "datePublished": "2025-01-26T05:24:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-27T15:03:49", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d8a4feb3-908f-4fff-84f2-099f56d46f5b?source=cve", "https://ays-pro.com/wordpress/quiz-maker", "https://ays-pro.com/changelog-for-quiz-maker-pro"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-10574"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "947b00ea-23db-3dc1-a0a3-256a3a4c8f7d", "product": {"name": "Quiz Maker Agency"}, "product_version": "* \u226431.8.0"}, {"id": "de0bf88f-de06-323b-abff-6d314c58055b", "product": {"name": "Quiz Maker Business"}, "product_version": "* \u22648.8.0"}, {"id": "e19c6b5f-8ae1-3017-a0df-32b0281ba8d7", "product": {"name": "Quiz Maker Developer"}, "product_version": "* \u226421.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8b89efd9-d660-3a04-8e76-434d90e9bb65", "vendor": {"name": "AYS Pro Plugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
