When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.\n\nThis feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-05-07T13:11:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:40:47", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4536", "https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/commit/a4e6018d2c0457fba6f672fafa6c590513c45d1b", "https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector", "https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/releases/tag/v0.6.3", "https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/22", "https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/198"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4536", "GHSA-2x52-8f29-7cjr"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6aacf271-d3bf-3405-8a64-8fc422a7d220", "product": {"name": "EDC"}, "product_version": "0.2.1 \u22640.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ded332a-1541-3fcd-b83e-b07123338100", "vendor": {"name": "Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
