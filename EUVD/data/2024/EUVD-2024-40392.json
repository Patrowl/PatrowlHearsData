Thus, an attacker will likely only be able to find this vulnerability by reverse-engineering the firmware or trying it on all <redacted> fields. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted> binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a payload.\n\nImpact: Critical \u2013 The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services.\n\nCVSS clarification. The attack can be executed over any network connection the station is listening to and serves the web interface (AV:N), and there are no additional security measure sin place that need to be circumvented (AC:L), the attack does not rely on preconditions (AT:N). The attack does require authentication, but the level of authentication is irrelevant (PR:L), it does not require user interaction (UI:N). If is a full system compromise, potentially fully compromising confidentiality, integrity and availability of the devicer (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H).\u00a0 A compromised charger can be used to \"pivot\" onto networks that should otherwise be closed, cause a low confidentiality and interity impact on subsequent systems. (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H).\u00a0Because this device is an EV charger handing significant amounts of power, we suspect this vulnerability can have a safety impact (S:P). The attack can be automated (AU:Y).", "datePublished": "2025-01-09T07:56:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-09T14:46:04", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:L/SI:L/SA:H/S:P/AU:Y", "references": ["https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2024-00035/", "https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2024-43648/", "https://iocharger.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-43648"], "assigner": "DIVD", "epss": 1.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ce44c9dd-870e-3045-bfc2-629d386ad776", "product": {"name": "Iocharger firmware for AC models"}, "product_version": "0 <24120701"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "06205b8f-f02d-3fbd-8859-691da79d322d", "vendor": {"name": "Iocharger"}}], "isExploited": false}
