The vulnerability arises from the application's handling of user modifications by managers or admins, allowing for the modification of all existing attributes of the `user` database entity without proper checks or sanitization. This flaw can be exploited to delete user threads, denying users access to their previously submitted data, or to inject fake threads and/or chat history for social engineering attacks.", "datePublished": "2024-05-26T22:25:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:33:53", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/a72d2923-297c-455f-af90-715e83b3da2b", "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/1b35bcbeab10b77e6dbd263cceecf1b965a40789"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4286"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "41b3b1ee-a5be-3f31-ae85-ad02e9a4f03e", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70f2bfae-d868-3a0e-a10f-2b141f9617b9", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
