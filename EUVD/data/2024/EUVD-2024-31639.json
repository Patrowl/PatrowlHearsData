This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "datePublished": "2024-06-04T05:32:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T19:32:42", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/451ca8a1-9354-462a-a110-c0c813cf0725?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluid-notification-bar/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3031"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "507608ae-ada0-382a-bb2c-4019cbf21963", "product": {"name": "Fluid Notification Bar"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "89a9537e-4d39-3b6d-973c-8802482193b2", "vendor": {"name": "shrinitech"}}], "isExploited": false}
