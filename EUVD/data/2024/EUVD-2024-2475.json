OpenFGA v1.5.7 and v1.5.8 are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from` expressions and a userset. Users should downgrade to v1.5.6 as soon as possible. This downgrade is backward compatible. As of time of publication, a patch is not available but OpenFGA's maintainers are planning a patch for inclusion in a future release.", "datePublished": "2024-08-09T21:16:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-10T14:21:04", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-m4hr-59h8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-42473", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-42473", "GHSA-3f6g-m4hr-59h8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f160c79c-e133-3907-80e9-708ae411d0d6", "product": {"name": "openfga"}, "product_version": "1.5.7, \u2264 1.5.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "85b43c49-1c38-3839-912b-a4a741171f55", "vendor": {"name": "openfga"}}], "isExploited": false}
