This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with access to a subscriber-level account, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: This vulnerability can be successfully exploited on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an OAuth pre-authenticated higher-level user (e.g., administrator) by leveraging a cross-site request forgery in conjunction with a certain social engineering technique to achieve a critical impact scenario (cross-site scripting to administrator-level account creation). However, successful exploitation requires \"Debug mode\" to be enabled in the plugin's \"Global Settings\".", "datePublished": "2024-03-02T07:35:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:48:22", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3bad1d0d-3817-4c7f-a012-5a85b577781e?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3042326/nextend-facebook-connect"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1775"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a046cec-5900-3eb3-bc24-943d9a7beb5e", "product": {"name": "Nextend Social Login and Register"}}, {"id": "da68258e-b512-3fe8-a2b1-d7fd0367e6ec", "product": {"name": "Nextend Social Login and Register"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.1.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e9f0115-2fcf-36cf-8804-211a7d78bfa2", "vendor": {"name": "nextendweb"}}], "isExploited": false}
