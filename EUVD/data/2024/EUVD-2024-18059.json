An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the Device Console UI process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. A manual reload of the fabric interconnect is needed to restore complete functionality.", "datePublished": "2024-02-28T16:16:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:59:42", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsfi-imm-syn-p6kZTDQC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20344"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a625a375-6f9e-308a-8cb6-6a70d52d4fbe", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e85a761e-3c9e-3c4a-b03c-ac509a264cd0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
