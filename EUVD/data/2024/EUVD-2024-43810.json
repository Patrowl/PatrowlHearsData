In affected versions FileServerService (media proxy) in github.com/misskey-dev/misskey 2024.10.1 or earlier did not detect proxy loops, which allows remote actors to execute a self-propagating reflected/amplified distributed denial-of-service via a maliciously crafted note. FileServerService.prototype.proxyHandler did not check incoming requests are not coming from another proxy server. An attacker can execute an amplified denial-of-service by sending a nested proxy request to the server and end the request with a malicious redirect back to another nested proxy request.\nLeading to unbounded recursion until the original request is timed out. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.11.0-alpha.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may configure the reverse proxy to block requests to the proxy with an empty User-Agent header or one containing Misskey/. An attacker can not effectively modify the User-Agent header without making another request to the server.", "datePublished": "2024-12-18T19:24:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-19T16:46:26", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-gq5q-c77c-v236"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-49363"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29e01235-83af-3191-85a8-dbbde315ebc3", "product": {"name": "misskey"}, "product_version": "< CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9d6ffe7-5f9b-3e40-aa04-05fa2f5380f3", "vendor": {"name": "misskey-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
