This issue arises due to insufficient backend validation of roles and permissions, enabling unauthorized users to join a project and potentially exploit roles and permissions not intended for their use. The vulnerability specifically affects the Team feature, where the backend fails to validate whether a user has paid for a plan before allowing them to send invite links with any role assigned. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of project settings or data.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T17:26:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-03T18:27:23", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/719a5db3-f943-4100-a660-011cadf1bb32", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/b7bd3a830a0f47ba07d0fd57bf78c4dd8a216297"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-5127"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aeb57001-d760-3254-a51d-0dcad770bf80", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "108d3450-d144-3b13-8fe5-bc77df7a57ff", "vendor": {"name": "lunary-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
