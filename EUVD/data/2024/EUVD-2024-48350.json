This is due to the plugin displaying errors and allowing direct access to the sse.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.", "datePublished": "2024-09-25T02:05:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-27T15:20:57", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2e69d666-50de-4c82-9ad4-9ed40fcc7218?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/peepso-core/#developers"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7426"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82b5b84b-aa52-3280-8e1e-4e707df75a5f", "product": {"name": "Community by PeepSo \u2013 Social Network, Membership, Registration, User Profiles, Premium \u2013 Mobile App"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.4.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "566b3292-2fae-33c9-9ec9-da66d84bf82b", "vendor": {"name": "PeepSo"}}], "isExploited": false}
