{"id": "EUVD-2024-3024", "enisaUuid": "7eac8f5b-d9ec-3f55-8fdf-10096f8814fe", "description": "Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows for dynamic UI components without leaving PHP. In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a \u201c.php\u201d file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute \u201c.php\u201d files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-10-08T17:48:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-17T18:22:08", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47823", "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/8624", "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/70503b79f5db75a1eac9bf55826038a6ee5a16d5", "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/cd168c6212ea13d13b82b3132485741f82d9fad9", "https://github.com/livewire/livewire"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47823", "GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4eba4a10-2726-3b95-96c8-70c241996acb", "product": {"name": "livewire"}, "product_version": "< 2.12.7"}, {"id": "7546d636-31f0-3fb0-bf6f-35dcbfe42063", "product": {"name": "livewire"}, "product_version": "3.0.0-beta.1, < 3.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e611f2c0-1116-3c92-80c4-c0138463094b", "vendor": {"name": "livewire"}}], "isExploited": false}
