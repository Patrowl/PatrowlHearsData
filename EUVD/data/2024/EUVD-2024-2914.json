Starting in version 1.35.0 and prior to version 1.37.1, clients that have enabled `LookupResources2` and have caveats in the evaluation path for their requests can return a permissionship of `CONDITIONAL` with context marked as missing, even then the context was supplied. LookupResources2 is the new default in SpiceDB 1.37.0 and has been opt-in since SpiceDB 1.35.0. The bug is patched as part of SpiceDB 1.37.1. As a workaround, disable LookupResources2 via the `--enable-experimental-lookup-resources` flag by setting it to `false`.", "datePublished": "2024-10-14T20:22:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-15T14:45:43", "baseScore": 2.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-3c32-4hq9-6wgj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48909", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/2f3cf77a7fcfcb478ef5a480a245842c96ac8853", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-48909", "GHSA-3c32-4hq9-6wgj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f1add8c0-8b5c-3e9c-9010-d6b112fa7fc0", "product": {"name": "spicedb"}, "product_version": "1.35.0, < 1.37.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e5dd03b2-8b30-3368-b40b-e1496ff4adf7", "vendor": {"name": "authzed"}}], "isExploited": false}
