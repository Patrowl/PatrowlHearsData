An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position between Cisco iNode Manager and associated deployed nodes could exploit this vulnerability by using the static cryptographic key to generate a trusted certificate and impersonate an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read data that is meant for a legitimate device, modify the startup configuration of an associated node, and, consequently, cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for downstream devices that are connected to the affected node.", "datePublished": "2024-07-17T16:28:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:59:41", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-inode-static-key-VUVCeynn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20323"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "005f06b4-df9f-34b6-88d9-52c347742bf0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Intelligent Node Software"}, "product_version": "N/A"}, {"id": "75c3e419-5255-3619-9ad4-fe35af2b114d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Intelligent Node Manager"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "79ca215f-2e0f-3c2e-b318-c88ca34372b9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
