Exploiting this vulnerability requires knowing the ID of a restricted dataset, but some IDs may be guessed by trying out many IDs in an automated way.\n\n\nAffected code:\n DatasetResolverImpl, L76-79 https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/v0.9.0/core/control-plane/control-plane-catalog/src/main/java/org/eclipse/edc/connector/controlplane/catalog/DatasetResolverImpl.java", "datePublished": "2024-09-27T09:35:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-27T16:09:20", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N/RE:M/U:Amber", "references": ["https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/pull/4490", "https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/pull/4491", "https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/35"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9202"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c20f4fbe-8473-37c6-927b-985b4762ea78", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Dataspace Components"}, "product_version": "0.1.3 \u22640.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8975ebd4-b18c-353e-8d60-5071375e5344", "vendor": {"name": "Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
