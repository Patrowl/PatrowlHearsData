Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by mounting cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with high privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-02-08T20:40:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:06:44", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/grafana/grafana/security/advisories/GHSA-cmf4-h3xc-jw8w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21703", "https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/45083", "https://grafana.com/blog/2022/02/08/grafana-7.5.15-and-8.3.5-released-with-moderate-severity-security-fixes", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2PFW6Q2LXXWTFRTMTRN4ZGADFRQPKJ3D", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36GUEPA5TPSC57DZTPYPBL6T7UPQ2FRH", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HLAQRRGNSO5MYCPAXGPH2OCSHOGHSQMQ", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220303-0005", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-21703.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7519", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8057", "https://grafana.com/blog/2022/02/08/grafana-7.5.15-and-8.3.5-released-with-moderate-severity-security-fixes/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220303-0005/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HLAQRRGNSO5MYCPAXGPH2OCSHOGHSQMQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2PFW6Q2LXXWTFRTMTRN4ZGADFRQPKJ3D/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36GUEPA5TPSC57DZTPYPBL6T7UPQ2FRH/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21703", "GHSA-cmf4-h3xc-jw8w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "92dd8661-1677-3c52-bbe8-7d8996b60a89", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "3.0-beta1, < 7.5.15"}, {"id": "efacd0d2-6cf8-322a-9540-bfdf7af76961", "product": {"name": "Grafana"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, < 8.3.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dfa22c98-07d6-357e-9990-57e33c400d2f", "vendor": {"name": "Grafana"}}], "isExploited": false}
