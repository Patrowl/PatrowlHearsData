Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users. Alternatively, you could configure a HTTP proxy in front of your Archiva instance to only forward requests that do not have malicious characters in the URL.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.", "datePublished": "2024-03-01T15:40:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:41:19", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27140", "https://attic.apache.org/projects/archiva.html", "https://github.com/apache/archiva", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/xrn6nt904ozh3jym60c3f5hj2fb75pjy", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/01/2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27140", "GHSA-hp2x-6vrm-7j7v"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 3.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1979e048-d21f-37c9-9128-01eed5031823", "product": {"name": "Apache Archiva"}, "product_version": "2.0.0 \u2264*"}, {"id": "83707a22-ceb3-3603-862b-e119f677a512", "product": {"name": "Apache Archiva"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "310533f0-8887-3d69-9187-1808a6552a8f", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
