A denial-of-service was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1: an unbounded recursion can cause Exiv2 to crash by exhausting the stack. The vulnerable function, `QuickTimeVideo::multipleEntriesDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2 versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The denial-of-service is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-02-13T01:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-23T03:00:00", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-crmj-qh74-2r36", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/2337", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25112", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/exiv2/PYSEC-2024-107.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-25112", "GHSA-crmj-qh74-2r36", "PYSEC-2024-107"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "777942e6-563e-3a81-80ca-44e84d77f27b", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}}, {"id": "c0b7a3c7-b76c-3703-bba8-0d4cef9ce457", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "0.28.0 < 0.28.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7abc564a-5c20-36b7-bb13-4568b8f50ae0", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
