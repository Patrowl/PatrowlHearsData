A null pointer dereference vulnerability has been identified in `gst_gdk_pixbuf_dec_flush` within `gstgdkpixbufdec.c`. This function invokes `memcpy`, using `out_pix` as the destination address. `out_pix` is expected to point to the frame 0 from the frame structure, which is read from the input file. However, in certain situations, it can points to a NULL frame, causing the subsequent call to `memcpy` to attempt writing to the null address (0x00), leading to a null pointer dereference. This vulnerability can result in a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a segmentation fault (SEGV). This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.", "datePublished": "2024-12-11T19:14:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:39:55", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-115_GHSL-2024-118_Gstreamer/", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8041.patch", "https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0025.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47613"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "75a58714-d6ae-35a7-95f2-edf1faaae72e", "product": {"name": "GStreamer"}, "product_version": "< 1.24.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ee9b9dfe-444b-31f5-9e37-d87d75ee80b3", "vendor": {"name": "GStreamer"}}], "isExploited": false}
