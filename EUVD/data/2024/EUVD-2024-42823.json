An integer underflow has been detected in the function qtdemux_parse_theora_extension within qtdemux.c. The vulnerability occurs due to an underflow of the gint size variable, which causes size to hold a large unintended value when cast to an unsigned integer. This 32-bit negative value is then cast to a 64-bit unsigned integer (0xfffffffffffffffa) in a subsequent call to gst_buffer_new_and_alloc. The function gst_buffer_new_allocate then attempts to allocate memory, eventually calling _sysmem_new_block. The function _sysmem_new_block adds alignment and header size to the (unsigned) size, causing the overflow of the 'slice_size' variable. As a result, only 0x89 bytes are allocated, despite the large input size. When the following memcpy call occurs in gst_buffer_fill, the data from the input file will overwrite the content of the GstMapInfo info structure. Finally, during the call to gst_memory_unmap, the overwritten memory may cause a function pointer hijack, as the mem->allocator->mem_unmap_full function is called with a corrupted pointer. This function pointer overwrite could allow an attacker to alter the execution flow of the program, leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.", "datePublished": "2024-12-11T19:12:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:39:54", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-166_Gstreamer/", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8032.patch", "https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0014.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47606"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f2160c1-cb2e-3db9-8527-a3c658386bc0", "product": {"name": "GStreamer"}, "product_version": "< 1.24.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "320b7c89-57f4-3c71-9f38-7c55c27dbd56", "vendor": {"name": "GStreamer"}}], "isExploited": false}
