Prior to versions 1.6.15, 1.7.15, and 1.8.1, Binding to `INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0)` or `IN6ADDR_ANY (::)` exposes an application on all network interfaces, increasing the risk of unauthorized access. As stated in the Python docs, a special form for address is accepted instead of a host address: `''` represents `INADDR_ANY`, equivalent to `\"0.0.0.0\"`. On systems with IPv6, '' represents `IN6ADDR_ANY`, which is equivalent to `\"::\"`. A user who serves docs on an unsecured public network, may unknowingly be hosting an unsecured (http) web site for any remote user/system to access on the same network. The issue has has been mitigated in dbt-core v1.6.15, dbt-core v1.7.15, and dbt-core v1.8.1 by binding to localhost explicitly by default in `dbt docs serve`.\n", "datePublished": "2024-05-27T17:17:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-21T14:20:58", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/security/advisories/GHSA-pmrx-695r-4349", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36105", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/10209", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/10208", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/commit/0c08d7a19ad1740be3cb0b2e6d9d64f6537176f7", "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1327.html", "https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket-families", "https://docs.securesauce.dev/rules/PY030", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/core/dbt/task/docs/serve.py#L23C38-L23C39", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.6.15", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.7.15", "https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/releases/tag/v1.8.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-36105", "GHSA-pmrx-695r-4349"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "533a6ff4-a8d2-3b10-aa68-2494d58c32db", "product": {"name": "dbt-core"}, "product_version": "1.7.0, < 1.7.15"}, {"id": "8cef3e4f-bd5d-3270-a8b2-759aef67f404", "product": {"name": "dbt-core"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.15"}, {"id": "cd9f4b9e-0af2-3749-981b-497daad3caf0", "product": {"name": "dbt-core"}, "product_version": "= 1.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c290c1b9-f921-339f-a563-c634a1383910", "vendor": {"name": "dbt-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
