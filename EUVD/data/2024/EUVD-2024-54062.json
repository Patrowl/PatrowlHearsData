This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the account_settings_save_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-03-14T04:22:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-14T13:59:46", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8afe386e-1e4f-4668-8309-6d47dedb008a?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/jobcareer-job-board-responsive-wordpress-theme/14221636"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11284"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9ae56b2-ded8-3051-8b05-a6fcc84aa4be", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
