Flaws have been identified in the way oqs-provider handles lengths decoded with DECODE_UINT32 at the start of serialized hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) keys and signatures. Unchecked length values are later used for memory reads and writes; malformed input can lead to crashes or information leakage. Handling of plain/non-hybrid PQ key operation is not affected. This issue has been patched in in v0.6.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-06-17T19:42:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:50:56", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/security/advisories/GHSA-pqvr-5cr8-v6fx", "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/pull/416"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-37305"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ba20d27-85f5-37b9-9c2d-ad6997558738", "product": {"name": "oqs-provider"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "459a7015-6076-3575-bd07-de5fa0acc3cf", "vendor": {"name": "open-quantum-safe"}}], "isExploited": false}
