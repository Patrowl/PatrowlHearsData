An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIMv2 packet to a PIM-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability can be exploited with either an IPv4 multicast or unicast packet.", "datePublished": "2024-09-25T16:28:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T18:58:06", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pim-APbVfySJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20464"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3e47178c-1965-326c-8473-9b80fd44c270", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "17.13.1a"}, {"id": "3e948663-494f-3a69-9046-691c2ef4fe7c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "17.13.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a588c6b7-f297-3e28-a68a-dd5d7a916d21", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
