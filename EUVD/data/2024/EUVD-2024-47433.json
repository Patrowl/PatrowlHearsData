This is due to missing nonce validation and the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2024-07-09T07:38:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:33:05", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/455b9695-e140-4bdb-b626-5c1695518563?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/generate-pdf-using-contact-form-7/tags/4.0.6/inc/templates/cf7-pdf-generation.admin.html.php#L74"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6317"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 8.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "623658eb-88f8-340b-8941-542cf0de705b", "product": {"name": "Generate PDF using Contact Form 7"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.0.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e356899b-061a-312d-ad10-1d0ea75be9d0", "vendor": {"name": "zealopensource"}}], "isExploited": false}
