By manipulating a DOM element through a crafted URL or user input, the attacker can inject malicious scripts that run when the page is rendered. This type of attack requires user interaction, as the victim would need to access a manipulated URL or provide specific input to trigger the vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-11-07T21:35:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-08T14:06:48", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb24-28.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-49524"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 6.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a3c8dc5f-5943-302f-b241-20881d2a00db", "product": {"name": "Adobe Experience Manager"}, "product_version": "0 \u22646.5.20"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "179da91c-1613-374a-97c8-da2ff5811d72", "vendor": {"name": "Adobe"}}], "isExploited": false}
