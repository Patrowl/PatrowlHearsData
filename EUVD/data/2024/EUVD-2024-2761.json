In affected versions clients could clobber values set by intermediate proxies (such as X-Forwarded-For) by providing a underscore version of the same header (X-Forwarded_For). Any users relying on proxy set variables is affected. v6.4.3/v5.6.9 now discards any headers using underscores if the non-underscore version also exists. Effectively, allowing the proxy defined headers to always win. Users are advised to upgrade. Nginx has a underscores_in_headers configuration variable to discard these headers at the proxy level as a mitigation. Any users that are implicitly trusting the proxy defined headers for security should immediately cease doing so until upgraded to the fixed versions.", "datePublished": "2024-09-19T22:42:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T22:15:51", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45614", "https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/cac3fd18cf29ed43719ff5d52d9cfec215f0a043", "https://github.com/puma/puma/commit/f196b23be24712fb8fb16051cc124798cc84f70e", "https://github.com/puma/puma", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/puma/CVE-2024-45614.yml", "https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#underscores_in_headers", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00004.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45614", "GHSA-9hf4-67fc-4vf4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "364cec6b-b1bd-3ea6-b3d9-14fb265b2482", "product": {"name": "puma"}, "product_version": "6.0.0, < 6.4.3"}, {"id": "45f28d00-8ccf-336c-a03f-fcaaeb036f79", "product": {"name": "puma"}, "product_version": "< 5.6.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c24c3a2b-15e7-34f1-87b4-2876b0ab02e7", "vendor": {"name": "puma"}}], "isExploited": false}
