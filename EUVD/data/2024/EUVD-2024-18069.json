An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wireless client to an affected AP and sending specific malformed frames over the wireless connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause degradation of service to other clients, which could potentially lead to a complete DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2024-03-27T16:47:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:59:41", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-airo-ap-dos-PPPtcVW"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20354"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5eea13be-c236-35aa-9029-48b8278921f9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software (IOS XE Controller)"}, "product_version": "N/A"}, {"id": "809f94a8-ceea-36e3-8420-cba879b41c75", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f352502-c429-32f8-93b6-b7acbd20034c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
