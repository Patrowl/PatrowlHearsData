When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-10-07T21:16:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:40:54", "baseScore": 3.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-rj48-v4mq-j4vg", "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/51b62387be93c65fa56bbabe1c3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47814"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3b8ea567-4f37-3142-8573-7246d87552ae", "product": {"name": "vim"}, "product_version": "< v9.1.0764"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e06160e4-4fd1-3504-8bb3-19eccaab3c48", "vendor": {"name": "vim"}}], "isExploited": false}
