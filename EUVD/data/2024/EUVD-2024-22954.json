Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-02-19T19:42:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-15T18:36:56", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-qqrm-9grj-6v32", "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/9a70ce8f5ea9df00001894809f5ce7bc69b14c8a", "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/2024.2.0-beta.10/packages/backend/src/core/activitypub/ApResolverService.ts#L69-L119", "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/2024.2.0-beta.10/packages/backend/src/core/activitypub/models/ApNoteService.ts#L112-L308", "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/2024.2.0-beta.10/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints/ap/show.ts#L125-L143"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-25636"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "911c91ae-1f12-358f-9e9a-e872dd00c8af", "product": {"name": "misskey"}}, {"id": "b582c43a-7147-3839-bd24-ca90abc87506", "product": {"name": "misskey"}, "product_version": "< 2024.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71f48146-0615-3baa-a264-4cb167b9f603", "vendor": {"name": "misskey-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
