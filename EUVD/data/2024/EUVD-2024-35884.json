In affected versions `casgate` allows remote unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information via GET request to an API endpoint.

An attacker could use `id` parameter of GET requests with value `anonymous/ anonymous` to bypass authorization on certain API endpoints. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to account takeover, privilege escalation or provide attacker with credential to other services. Users are advised to upgrade.
