The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2024-01-18T02:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-01-29T10:20:58", "baseScore": 9.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm", "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm", "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/1374c824271cb7e927740664d06d2e577624ca3e", "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/c7cdc18ad9134a75222974b39e8b427c4af845fc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22416", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pyload-ng/PYSEC-2024-17.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-22416", "GHSA-pgpj-v85q-h5fm", "PYSEC-2024-17"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 5.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "267ce52d-0a81-36f8-a248-01c67a8d8388", "product": {"name": "pyload"}}, {"id": "8f80b0fe-84bc-3b5a-b97d-8fbe332001ac", "product": {"name": "pyload"}, "product_version": "< 0.5.0b3.dev78"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "267ce52d-0a81-36f8-a248-01c67a8d8388", "vendor": {"name": "pyload"}}], "isExploited": false}
