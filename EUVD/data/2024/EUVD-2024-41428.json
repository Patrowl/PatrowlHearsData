This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized ownership transfer, contrary to the original owner's intention of leaving the contract without an owner. It introduces a security risk where an unintended party (pending owner) can gain control of the contract after the original owner has renounced ownership. This could also be used by a malicious owner to simulate leaving a contract without an owner, to later regain ownership by previously having proposed himself as a pending owner. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.16.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-08-30T23:51:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T19:52:20", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-w2px-25pm-2cf9", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/commit/ef87d7847980e0cf83f4b7f3ff23e6590fb643ec", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/releases/tag/v0.16.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45304"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f2e42f37-8c83-3709-8556-b5caf263335b", "product": {"name": "cairo-contracts"}, "product_version": "< 0.16.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "21ed4da6-d686-39e1-9a5e-dfc3a0c6ee9d", "vendor": {"name": "OpenZeppelin"}}], "isExploited": false}
