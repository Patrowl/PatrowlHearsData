Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder->view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.\n", "datePublished": "2024-04-10T22:25:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:59:50", "baseScore": 2.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-j85q-46hg-36p2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32001", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/a244ed1edfaf2382711dccdb699971ec97190c7b", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.30.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32001", "GHSA-j85q-46hg-36p2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ea19067-49ac-354d-9899-9c168b9f0c90", "product": {"name": "spicedb"}, "product_version": "< 1.30.1"}, {"id": "869aa682-ac02-3143-ba20-84fa152ab85e", "product": {"name": "spicedb"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "560875f3-fcac-3b0c-8a75-d259f0b423b4", "vendor": {"name": "authzed"}}], "isExploited": false}
