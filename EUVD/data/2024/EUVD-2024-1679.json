It was discovered that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "datePublished": "2024-05-01T10:49:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T02:27:53", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-jxgr-gcj5-cqqg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32979", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5646", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5647", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/2ea5797ea43646d5d8b29433e4c707b5a9758146", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/42440ebd9b381534ad89d62420ebea00d703d64e", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/releases/tag/v1.6.20", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/releases/tag/v2.2.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32979", "GHSA-jxgr-gcj5-cqqg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a234ebb7-1e75-3c0f-9513-867dea481184", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.20"}, {"id": "ac095443-10cc-32f3-b4a3-32f5f564ccaa", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36a5e07c-2804-313b-9450-23fe5b040df0", "vendor": {"name": "nautobot"}}], "isExploited": false}
