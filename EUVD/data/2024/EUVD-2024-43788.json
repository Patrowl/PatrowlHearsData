An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders `C:\\Sandbox\\UserB\\xxx`. An authenticated attacker who can use `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside any sandbox can read other users' files in `C:\\Sandbox\\xxx`. By default in Windows 7+, the `C:\\Users\\UserA` folder is not readable by **UserB**.\nAll files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\\Users are safe. If `UserB` runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access `C:\\Sandox\\UserA`. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder `C:\\Sandbox\\UserA` with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn't reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed. Users are advised to limit access to their systems using Sandboxie.", "datePublished": "2024-11-29T18:11:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-02T20:32:39", "baseScore": 9.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/sandboxie-plus/Sandboxie/security/advisories/GHSA-4chj-3c28-gvmp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-49360"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42bec6bd-3f38-351e-b6c9-7cf2ee341704", "product": {"name": "Sandboxie"}, "product_version": "< v1.14.6 / 5.69.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a0f8aaa-1a83-35d8-b2dc-d141fdabe0a1", "vendor": {"name": "sandboxie-plus"}}], "isExploited": false}
