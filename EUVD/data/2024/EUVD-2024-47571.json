This is due to a lack of validation and missing capability check on user-supplied data in the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.", "datePublished": "2024-09-14T12:31:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:42:48", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/de7cde2c-142c-4004-9302-be335265d87d?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/login-with-phone-number/trunk/login-with-phonenumber.php#L3803", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3129185/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6482"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9da9f1d-03e0-3e95-97aa-8ea9a2889a06", "product": {"name": "Login with phone number"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.7.49"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5be4f3c-92f0-36b2-b58f-fccf1bf41330", "vendor": {"name": "glboy"}}], "isExploited": false}
