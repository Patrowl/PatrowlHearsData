{"id": "EUVD-2024-3063", "enisaUuid": "9b52cb51-2dfc-3bd0-b790-dc9f71a000c6", "description": "ssoready is a single sign on provider implemented via docker. Affected versions are vulnerable to XML signature bypass attacks. An attacker can carry out signature bypass if you have access to certain IDP-signed messages. The underlying mechanism exploits differential behavior between XML parsers. Users of https://ssoready.com, the public hosted instance of SSOReady, are unaffected. We advise folks who self-host SSOReady to upgrade to 7f92a06 or later. Do so by updating your SSOReady Docker images from sha-... to sha-7f92a06. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-10-09T18:32:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-11T16:58:48", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/security/advisories/GHSA-j2hr-q93x-gxvh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47832", "https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready/commit/7f92a0630439972fcbefa8c7eafe8c144bd89915", "https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3185", "https://ssoready.com/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting-sso-ready"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47832", "GHSA-j2hr-q93x-gxvh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "269a6c50-8bcf-334b-ada2-1a7c05b63fe1", "product": {"name": "ssoready"}, "product_version": "< 0.0.0-20241009153838-7f92a0630439"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "743f8f88-9af2-3ac1-8f53-5e227e424a56", "vendor": {"name": "ssoready"}}], "isExploited": false}
