The `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 doesn't take into account the verification status of the user's own identity while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation. If the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity, a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method, which lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate. The 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate includes a fix. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-07-18T16:45:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:33:11", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40648", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/76a7052149bb8f722df12da915b3a06d19a6695a", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/0.7.2-crypto", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0356.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-40648", "GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c6debcab-5ac0-3382-8c1b-89c1a9b3d3de", "product": {"name": "matrix-rust-sdk"}, "product_version": "< 0.7.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01c33edd-7b8f-3a98-ba2c-92f85d8f07b4", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
