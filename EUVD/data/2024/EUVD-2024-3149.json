The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished. By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action, remote code execution can be achieved in versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-10-25T22:48:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T19:41:54", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-w7hq-f2pj-c53g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47821", "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/48f59567393a19263c8a0285256a7537dc9ce109", "https://github.com/pyload/pyload"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47821", "GHSA-w7hq-f2pj-c53g"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.65, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a3da9dc-0bec-3aed-b1a2-88d5f2fd30da", "product": {"name": "pyload"}, "product_version": "< 0.5.0b3.dev87"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7ae5aaae-fa80-3d8c-901b-b2a623148032", "vendor": {"name": "pyload"}}], "isExploited": false}
