Prior to version 1.8.5, the Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. As a workaround, some extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe.", "datePublished": "2024-01-05T21:02:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-03T14:40:49", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-733r-8xcp-w9mr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21641", "https://github.com/flarum/flarum-core/commit/ee8b3b4ad1413a2b0971fdd9e40f812d2a3a9d3a", "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/7d70328471cf3091d92d95c382d277aec7996176"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21641", "GHSA-733r-8xcp-w9mr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 37.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "08cb6bde-e846-34ca-9219-94c3af119913", "product": {"name": "framework"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.5"}, {"id": "f67115c1-c119-3305-803b-92897ed2bd3c", "product": {"name": "framework"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "353c6d18-b0e1-36a8-9111-35f043176492", "vendor": {"name": "flarum"}}], "isExploited": false}
