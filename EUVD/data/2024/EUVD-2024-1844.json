A mitigating factor is that it requires the allow_url_include PHP runtime setting to be on, which is off in default installations. It also requires the /Upgrade route to be exposed, which is exposed by default after installing VuFind, and is recommended to be disabled by setting autoConfigure to false in config.ini.", "datePublished": "2024-05-22T18:56:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T15:47:12", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25738", "https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/commit/a19577d3d87d68e5c3f8ade63added44882a193c", "https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind", "https://vufind.org/wiki/security:cve-2024-25738"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-25738", "GHSA-wx24-vqrg-m6m5"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ea95040-c044-3cce-9ceb-63554abd6fe9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2a7ab3f6-597b-3cbf-95a7-8908bd939ade", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
