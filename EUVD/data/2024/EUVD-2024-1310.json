{"id": "EUVD-2024-1310", "enisaUuid": "2d11572c-555e-3e51-a4ad-1e341e746788", "description": "OpenTelemetry dotnet is a dotnet telemetry framework. In affected versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` the `url.full` writes attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests. These attributes are defined by the Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans. Up until version `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents. Note: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability. The `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-04-12T22:58:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:59:50", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2m-22xx-q94f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32028", "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/commit/e222ecb5942d4ce1cadfd4306c39e3f4933a5c42", "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet", "https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32028", "GHSA-vh2m-22xx-q94f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1c0c4c6f-8563-3549-9e25-55ce69f158d9", "product": {"name": "opentelemetry-dotnet"}}, {"id": "2b599401-9268-3406-8a27-ce7aa05a6d4a", "product": {"name": "opentelemetry-dotnet"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "569483f7-22a7-316b-aa0b-20e152b3d38b", "vendor": {"name": "open-telemetry"}}], "isExploited": false}
