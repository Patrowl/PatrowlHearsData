In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.", "datePublished": "2024-11-18T20:08:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T14:45:27", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-27mf-ghqm-j3j8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52303", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/bc15db61615079d1b6327ba42c682f758fa96936", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52303", "GHSA-27mf-ghqm-j3j8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35c75b31-4938-32a0-a203-39dba12d8bdd", "product": {"name": "aiohttp"}, "product_version": "3.10.6, < 3.10.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1c700175-d4d0-3b3e-850e-79558100807d", "vendor": {"name": "aio-libs"}}], "isExploited": false}
