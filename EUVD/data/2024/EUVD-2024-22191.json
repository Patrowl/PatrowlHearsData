Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.", "datePublished": "2024-03-15T19:13:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T23:28:12", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-58vw-246g-fjj4", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/003b80e62f97cd8c0114d6b9d3f93c10443e6fae"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24827"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0ddc8eb6-244a-3f41-8db2-bfa57e21aed4", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "stable \u2264 3.2.0"}, {"id": "171ff114-4331-3c71-a7f0-430261d03bbd", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "tests-passed < 3.3.0.beta1"}, {"id": "f7ade123-469d-31cb-83e7-9c261bd470be", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "beta < 3.3.0.beta1"}, {"id": "fde31d77-9dab-3bf6-9523-8222c5ae7960", "product": {"name": "discourse"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fde31d77-9dab-3bf6-9523-8222c5ae7960", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
