Versions prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the /public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server. This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the `App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application is deployed. Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-03-22T17:03:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-21T22:49:49", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-7p9x-ch4c-vqj9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-29185"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35aa6a6d-0301-3693-b60e-84cffef72b16", "product": {"name": "freescout"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.128"}, {"id": "db06d9d1-90f7-3f19-a17e-b4487a63d5c5", "product": {"name": "freescout"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "817eb1ea-7bad-3dd1-b70a-178d48fcf048", "vendor": {"name": "freescout-helpdesk"}}], "isExploited": false}
