Despite efforts to filter out intranet IP addresses starting with 192, 172, 10, and 127 through regular expressions and limit access protocols to HTTP and HTTPS, attackers can still bypass these restrictions using alternative representations of IP addresses and accessing other ports running on localhost. This vulnerability enables attackers to access any asset on the internal network, attack web services on the internal network, scan hosts on the internal network, and potentially access AWS metadata endpoints. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs, which can be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.", "datePublished": "2024-06-05T00:00:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:33:52", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/bf44517e-a07d-4f54-89b4-3b05fca2a008"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4084"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "27553bde-a9e9-3534-8efa-9e92d739bfcc", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cc2b700d-1c9e-34a8-823f-6f1adc5414ad", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
