The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ application has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An attacker can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails at once. An attacker can utilize the target application's email server to send phishing messages. This can get the server on a blacklist, causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation damages. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.", "datePublished": "2024-02-05T20:44:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T22:35:35", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/security/advisories/GHSA-9hhf-xmcw-r3xg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22208", "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ/commit/a34d94ab7b1be9256a9ef898f18ea6bfb63f6f1e", "https://github.com/thorsten/phpMyFAQ", "https://www.phpmyfaq.de/security/advisory-2024-02-05"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-22208", "GHSA-9hhf-xmcw-r3xg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84e6f7e0-fe68-31d1-87fb-3e3168a8b626", "product": {"name": "phpMyFAQ"}}, {"id": "eee9608d-050e-3dc6-82a6-28b74b0ed8dc", "product": {"name": "phpMyFAQ"}, "product_version": "< 3.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "048a55a8-f5ef-331c-a4f6-dafc3e06ca9a", "vendor": {"name": "thorsten"}}], "isExploited": false}
