The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom protocol (`sidequest://`) to trigger actions in the application from its web contents. Because, prior to version 0.10.35, the deep link URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the application. As of version 0.10.35, the custom protocol links within the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.", "datePublished": "2024-01-04T14:48:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-04T20:30:54", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/SideQuestVR/SideQuest/security/advisories/GHSA-3v86-cf9q-x4x7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21625"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.89, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0ca9264a-986f-32d4-831e-2962cca515ac", "product": {"name": "SideQuest"}}, {"id": "196b116c-0d53-3939-b37c-935718894cbb", "product": {"name": "SideQuest"}, "product_version": "< 0.10.35"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e78a7f48-814f-320c-af34-a2797946d2d3", "vendor": {"name": "SideQuestVR"}}], "isExploited": false}
