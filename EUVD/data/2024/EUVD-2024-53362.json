Later we\nreplaced the use of the system workqueue with our own private\nworkqueue but hadn't rerun the AER handler testing since then.", "datePublished": "2024-12-29T09:30:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T18:31:48", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13355dd37e22edbcb99c599f783233188740a650", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/746e6ae2e202b062b9deee7bd86d94937997ecd7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56714"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56714"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03d60c01-b96b-3814-a384-21eb774934b1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.7"}, {"id": "56c18af5-7dd3-309d-b4c3-b596e65fec9f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9e25450da7006cd6f425248a5b38dad4adb3c981 <746e6ae2e202b062b9deee7bd86d94937997ecd7"}, {"id": "7a50baa1-660e-3717-a11c-8912ca6ecbb6", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.11"}, {"id": "b29e6d0c-5826-3be0-98c3-016c34349e92", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "d7bd740b-a944-3f47-9c41-cc534929357d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9e25450da7006cd6f425248a5b38dad4adb3c981 <13355dd37e22edbcb99c599f783233188740a650"}, {"id": "e4c83c6d-2d33-3b89-90cb-5ccbb39ead36", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d432361c-c9c5-3f13-9914-565f45743749", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
