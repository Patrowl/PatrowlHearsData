The new link field introduced in Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a \"Custom\" link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined link formats.  As the \"Custom\" link type is meant to be flexible, it also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is patched in 4.1.1.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-02-26T16:44:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T00:27:57", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-63h4-w25c-3qv4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27087", "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/commit/cda3dd9a15228d35e62ff86cfa87a67e7c687437", "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby", "https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.1.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27087", "GHSA-63h4-w25c-3qv4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34c46217-8da4-3b09-a47e-6d0dd2cd312e", "product": {"name": "kirby"}}, {"id": "f1910ade-9966-3dbe-9b34-c8f0dbc1c0bb", "product": {"name": "kirby"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c6325309-af5a-3ae5-8ccd-05f5ad0d32ef", "vendor": {"name": "getkirby"}}], "isExploited": false}
