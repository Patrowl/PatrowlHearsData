Specifically, the vulnerability exists in versions v0.5.0 up to but not including 5.1.0. The issue arises from the application's method of validating shell commands against an allowlist or denylist, where it only checks the first word of the command. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions by crafting commands that are executed despite not being on the allowlist or by including malicious commands not present in the denylist. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T18:19:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T18:56:22", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/416c4a8b-36ba-4bbc-850a-a2f978b0fac8", "https://github.com/significant-gravitas/autogpt/commit/26324f29849967fa72c207da929af612f1740669"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1881"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.83, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb679ca8-a883-3e62-ad25-dab3b6633fd3", "product": {"name": "significant-gravitas/autogpt"}, "product_version": "unspecified <5.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c39ef74a-c764-3542-9a83-3af9358041af", "vendor": {"name": "Significant-Gravitas"}}], "isExploited": false}
