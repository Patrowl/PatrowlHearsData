When a GDBus-based client subscribes to signals from a trusted system service such as NetworkManager on a shared computer, other users of the same computer can send spoofed D-Bus signals that the GDBus-based client will wrongly interpret as having been sent by the trusted system service. This could lead to the GDBus-based client behaving incorrectly, with an application-dependent impact.", "datePublished": "2024-05-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T22:06:15", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3268", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/07/5", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IRSFYAE5X23TNRWX7ZWEJOMISLCDSYNS/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UNFJHISR4O6VFOHBFWH5I5WWMG37H63A/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00008.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0008/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LL6HSJDXCXMLEIJBYV6CPOR4K2NTCTXW/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCDY3KA7G7D3DRXYTT46K6LFHS2KHWBH/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34397", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IRSFYAE5X23TNRWX7ZWEJOMISLCDSYNS", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LCDY3KA7G7D3DRXYTT46K6LFHS2KHWBH", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LL6HSJDXCXMLEIJBYV6CPOR4K2NTCTXW", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UNFJHISR4O6VFOHBFWH5I5WWMG37H63A"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-34397"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8061d00-3fa2-3a35-bfa2-f75987fb2643", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "867991ed-208c-3aa3-b31a-e465038d8b3a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
