This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "datePublished": "2024-05-02T16:51:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T19:32:42", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0417e2d7-0c0a-48e1-bf18-3f5e16b1b8a0?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/announcekit/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3023"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b81047c5-2bf5-33a3-87bc-c1ad8eac6af9", "product": {"name": "AnnounceKit"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.0.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bec0a8cc-74cd-3c01-acca-331c11fa2c24", "vendor": {"name": "restpack"}}], "isExploited": false}
