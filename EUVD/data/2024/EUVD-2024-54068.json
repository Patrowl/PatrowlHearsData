This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email via the account_settings_callback() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-03-14T04:22:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-14T15:15:32", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0e61c98d-a6f4-4ac0-b9f9-2b936c030413?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/jobcareer-job-board-responsive-wordpress-theme/14221636"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11285"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be97c405-d232-3b0f-aa3e-321706a8092b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
