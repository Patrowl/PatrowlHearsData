When a tensor proto of type VARIANT is unpacked, memory is first allocated to store the entire tensor, and a ctor is called on each instance. Afterwards, Reverb copies the content in tensor_content\u00a0to the previously mentioned pre-allocated memory, which results in the bytes in tensor_content\u00a0overwriting the vtable pointers of all the objects which were previously allocated.\u00a0Reverb exposes 2 relevant gRPC endpoints: InsertStream and SampleStream. The attacker can insert this stream into the server\u2019s database, then when the client next calls SampleStream they will unpack the tensor into RAM, and when any method on that object is called (including its destructor) the attacker gains control of the Program Counter. We recommend upgrading past git commit\u00a0 https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/commit/6a0dcf4c9e842b7f999912f792aaa6f6bd261a25", "datePublished": "2024-09-19T15:50:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-19T18:02:42", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8375", "https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/issues/141", "https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/commit/6a0dcf4c9e842b7f999912f792aaa6f6bd261a25", "https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-8375", "GHSA-w69q-w4h4-2fx8"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1c2b1002-8bed-3d14-8681-404f7f9e1af6", "product": {"name": "reverb"}, "product_version": "0 <https://github.com/google-deepmind/reverb/commit/6a0dcf4c9e842b7f999912f792aaa6f6bd261a25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de00dad7-a032-3f7b-823b-5f2a0945a8cc", "vendor": {"name": "Google Deepmind"}}], "isExploited": false}
