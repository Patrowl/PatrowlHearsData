An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email that contains a crafted attachment through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to replace any file on the underlying file system. The attacker could then perform any of the following actions: add users with root privileges, modify the device configuration, execute arbitrary code, or cause a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r Note: Manual intervention is required to recover from the DoS condition. Customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a device in this condition.", "datePublished": "2024-07-17T16:26:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T21:59:42", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esa-afw-bGG2UsjH"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-20401"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 11.83, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "103a7549-5b64-3503-9c76-e87566220da6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Secure Email"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "199cd6bd-dabc-344a-8fa5-7d8c101b97d6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
