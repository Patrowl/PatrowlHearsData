Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-05-27T16:40:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:07:46", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-35231", "https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/commit/0eec2a9836329051c6742549e65a94a4c24fe6f7", "https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/rack-contrib/CVE-2024-35231.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-35231", "GHSA-8c8q-2xw3-j869"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "44dc55b3-2c0f-3327-a5e0-af9e9f3e4c78", "product": {"name": "rack-contrib"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ebb8799-7c54-39b8-ae0a-dea896c0381b", "vendor": {"name": "rack"}}], "isExploited": false}
