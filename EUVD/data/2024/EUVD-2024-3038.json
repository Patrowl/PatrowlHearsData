Prior to version 1.0.0-dev.29, certificate verification in `lib/agent/certificate.dart` does not occur properly. During the delegation verification in the `_checkDelegation` function, the canister_ranges aren't verified. The impact of not checking the canister_ranges is that a subnet can sign canister responses in behalf of another subnet. The certificate\u2019s timestamp, i.e /time path, is also not verified, meaning that the certificate effectively has no expiration time. Version 1.0.0-dev.29 implements appropriate certificate verification.", "datePublished": "2024-10-15T17:12:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T16:53:44", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/security/advisories/GHSA-fmj7-7gfw-64pg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-48915", "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/commit/0d200686aabcd9313c7bc3e675cbdc82f6b775cf", "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart", "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/blob/f50971dfae3f536c1720f0084f28afbcf5d99cb5/lib/agent/certificate.dart#L162", "https://github.com/AstroxNetwork/agent_dart/blob/main/lib/agent/certificate.dart"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-48915", "GHSA-fmj7-7gfw-64pg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fe029764-6322-3e5e-bd32-3b8f7059f32a", "product": {"name": "agent_dart"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0-dev.29"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "481740f2-4df8-3660-8e7e-e77d4f182954", "vendor": {"name": "AstroxNetwork"}}], "isExploited": false}
