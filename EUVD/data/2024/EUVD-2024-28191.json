A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability is a combination of path traversal and arbitrary code execution, specifically targeting the `rspamd_maps()` function. It allows authenticated admin users to overwrite any file writable by the www-data user by exploiting improper path validation. The exploit chain can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server. Version 2024-04 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-04-04T20:27:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-12T20:52:59", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-4m8r-87gc-3vvp", "https://mailcow.email/posts/2024/release-2024-04", "https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/remote-code-execution-in-mailcow-always-sanitize-error-messages"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-30270"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 49.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e158e3a4-7f7b-3a30-86f1-cde4a149f521", "product": {"name": "mailcow-dockerized"}}, {"id": "f969985d-aff2-31b7-a023-a02f2284917e", "product": {"name": "mailcow-dockerized"}, "product_version": "< 2024-04"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a902d08-d5df-3d93-a298-372f657896e7", "vendor": {"name": "mailcow"}}], "isExploited": false}
