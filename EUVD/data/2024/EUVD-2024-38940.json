Monkeytype is vulnerable to Poisoned Pipeline Execution through Code Injection in its ci-failure-comment.yml GitHub Workflow, enabling attackers to gain pull-requests write access. The ci-failure-comment.yml workflow is triggered when the Monkey CI workflow completes. When it runs, it will download an artifact uploaded by the triggering workflow and assign the contents of ./pr_num/pr_num.txt artifact to the steps.pr_num_reader.outputs.content WorkFlow variable. It is not validated that the variable is actually a number and later it is interpolated into a JS script allowing an attacker to change the code to be executed. This issue leads to pull-requests write access. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.30.0.", "datePublished": "2024-08-02T14:46:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T16:52:08", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/security/advisories/GHSA-wcjf-5464-4wq9", "https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/commit/29627fd0d5f152e2da59671987090ea0a5c29874", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-167_monkeytype"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41127"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d0103b67-23f6-3e11-aa9e-8c589c5dbb2c", "product": {"name": "monkeytype"}, "product_version": "< 24.30.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d6e599fc-de0d-3dd7-8872-bfea5b7f05ad", "vendor": {"name": "monkeytypegame"}}], "isExploited": false}
