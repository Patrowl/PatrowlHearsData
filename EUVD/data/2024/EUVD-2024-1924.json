If the preopened directory has a symlink pointing outside, WASI programs can traverse the symlink and access host filesystem if the caller sets both `oflags::creat` and `rights::fd_write`. Programs can also crash the runtime by creating a symlink pointing outside with `path_symlink` and `path_open`ing the link. This issue has been addressed in commit `b9483d022` which has been included in release version 4.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-06-19T19:55:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:04:25", "baseScore": 2.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/security/advisories/GHSA-55f3-3qvg-8pv5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38358", "https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/commit/b9483d022c602b994103f78ecfe46f017f8ac662", "https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-38358", "GHSA-55f3-3qvg-8pv5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07891dae-b2eb-3079-8f69-f7d2dbe0d6cd", "product": {"name": "wasmer"}, "product_version": "< 4.3.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a9d41b7-a35b-3ae0-aad4-d26af02112b1", "vendor": {"name": "wasmerio"}}], "isExploited": false}
