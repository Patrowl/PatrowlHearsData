Prior to 2.4.3, some specifically configured Spin applications that use `self` requests without a specified URL authority can be induced to make requests to arbitrary hosts via the `Host` HTTP header. The following conditions need to be met for an application to be vulnerable: 1. The environment Spin is deployed in routes requests to the Spin runtime based on the request URL instead of the `Host` header, and leaves the `Host` header set to its original value; 2. The Spin application's component handling the incoming request is configured with an `allow_outbound_hosts` list containing `\"self\"`; and 3. In reaction to an incoming request, the component makes an outbound request whose URL doesn't include the hostname/port. Spin 2.4.3 has been released to fix this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-05-08T14:32:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T02:27:53", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fermyon/spin/security/advisories/GHSA-f3h7-gpjj-wcvh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-32980", "https://github.com/fermyon/spin/commit/b3db535c9edb72278d4db3a201f0ed214e561354", "https://github.com/fermyon/spin"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-32980", "GHSA-f3h7-gpjj-wcvh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f1ef61d9-c183-38ac-87d9-7be5c04058d3", "product": {"name": "spin"}, "product_version": "< 2.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2df19228-a065-3b9c-bf8d-5a790ee54ba8", "vendor": {"name": "fermyon"}}], "isExploited": false}
