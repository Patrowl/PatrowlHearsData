{"id": "EUVD-2024-2787", "enisaUuid": "ef6ae9ae-fd46-3fe2-9e96-5db15d97c659", "description": "An open redirect vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A specially crafted URL can be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and automation into believing that the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a malicious server. This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.\r\n\r\nOnce a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain.", "datePublished": "2024-09-09T18:49:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T20:56:40", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7260", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6502", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6503", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7260", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2301875", "https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7260", "GHSA-g4gc-rh26-m3p5"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b72e05a5-4f17-30fe-a64e-3b12488e5849", "product": {"name": "Red Hat build of Keycloak 24"}, "product_version": "patch: 24.0.7-4"}, {"id": "cf83c5d9-5146-33e8-b283-1d0cf2e0fb94", "product": {"name": "Red Hat build of Keycloak 24"}, "product_version": "patch: 24-16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96912dce-b5df-3f98-b60c-e2bc6945c686", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
