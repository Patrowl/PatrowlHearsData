The vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Code Agent container. Exploiting this vulnerability would require an attacker to have network access to the Code Agent within the deployment environment. External exploitation of this vulnerability is unlikely and depends on both misconfigurations of the cluster and/or chaining with another vulnerability. However, internal exploitation (with a cluster misconfiguration) could still be possible.", "datePublished": "2024-12-06T13:21:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-06T17:54:30", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21571"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21571"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "65b18a90-26ac-3642-b379-e02bad2fb677", "product": {"name": "Code Agent"}, "product_version": "0 <*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3dd55432-c1a7-3ddf-ba51-4c0572297a06", "vendor": {"name": "Snyk"}}], "isExploited": false}
