RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based `HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based `HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with `/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise. Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch.", "datePublished": "2024-03-18T21:13:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-26T13:54:04", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/security/advisories/GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24578"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 63.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "80cad4e9-4538-38ec-9467-e3a12f897ac4", "product": {"name": "RaspberryMatic"}}, {"id": "e5e8d1ff-ae3d-3932-ad60-c8f1a61a6f31", "product": {"name": "RaspberryMatic"}, "product_version": "< 3.75.6.20240316"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "452c83f8-4ccf-3e06-aa42-b8178df33a8b", "vendor": {"name": "jens-maus"}}], "isExploited": false}
