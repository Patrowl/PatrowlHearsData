Argo CD has a Web-based terminal that allows users to get a shell inside a running pod, just as they would with kubectl exec. Starting in version 2.6.0, when the administrator enables this function and grants permission to the user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow`, even if the user revokes this permission, the user can still perform operations in the container, as long as the user keeps the terminal view open for a long time. Although the token expiration and revocation of the user are fixed, however, the fix does not address the situation of revocation of only user `p, role:myrole, exec, create, */*, allow` permissions, which may still lead to the leakage of sensitive information. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.11.7, 2.10.16, and 2.9.21.", "datePublished": "2024-07-24T17:16:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-12T21:02:57", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-v8wx-v5jq-qhhw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41666", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/05edb2a9ca48f0f10608c1b49fbb0cf7164f6476", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/e96f32d233504101ddac028a5bf8117433d333d6", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/ef535230d8bd8ad7b18aab1ea1063e9751d348c4", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fynj5Sho8Lf8CETqsNXZyPKlTDdmgJuN/view?usp=sharing", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3006"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41666", "GHSA-v8wx-v5jq-qhhw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0dbdcf76-365d-332b-8132-e0da4e8fc669", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.6.0, < 2.9.21"}, {"id": "88509b1d-95a2-3a9a-9f13-c95643e503db", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.11.0, < 2.11.7"}, {"id": "fa79c071-20e0-3bc1-a179-ff302132df79", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.10.0, < 2.10.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0e42b4bd-adf8-38ce-a6cd-c9f3c9df3de2", "vendor": {"name": "argoproj"}}], "isExploited": false}
