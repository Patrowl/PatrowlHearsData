In version 1.2.4 and all prior versions, the API endpoint `http://<Server-IP>/v1/users/login` in ZimaOS returns distinct responses based on whether a username exists or the password is incorrect. This behavior can be exploited for username enumeration, allowing attackers to determine whether a user exists in the system or not. Attackers can leverage this information in further attacks, such as credential stuffing or targeted password brute-forcing. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "datePublished": "2024-10-24T21:25:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T17:28:49", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/ZimaOS/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-8r88-3mx5", "https://youtu.be/BClx2u8DMfM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-49358"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "209bdd2a-3273-3737-b26f-20d1b90f958a", "product": {"name": "ZimaOS"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f8aec49-a1ff-3946-940a-2cbc85235f1b", "vendor": {"name": "IceWhaleTech"}}], "isExploited": false}
