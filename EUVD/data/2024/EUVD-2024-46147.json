A vulnerability has been found starting in version 4.6.0 and prior to version 5.1.0 that allows an attacker to bypass eLabFTW's built-in multifactor authentication mechanism. An attacker who can authenticate locally (by knowing or guessing the password of a user) can thus log in regardless of MFA requirements. This does not affect MFA that are performed by single sign-on services. Users are advised to upgrade to at least version 5.1.9 to receive a fix.", "datePublished": "2024-12-09T18:38:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-10T16:20:39", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/security/advisories/GHSA-pvxr-39g3-m28c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52586"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89379647-ef8a-3d17-84c7-304cade2961d", "product": {"name": "elabftw"}, "product_version": "4.6.0, < 5.1.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "527da05d-9f1b-3a28-86e3-27c23b34ed76", "vendor": {"name": "elabftw"}}], "isExploited": false}
