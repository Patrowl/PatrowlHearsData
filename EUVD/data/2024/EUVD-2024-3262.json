This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver. XStream 1.4.21 has been patched to detect the manipulation in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.", "datePublished": "2024-11-07T23:38:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T22:19:56", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-hfq9-hggm-c56q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47072", "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/bb838ce2269cac47433e31c77b2b236466e9f266", "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/commit/fdd9f7d3de0d7ccf2f9979bcd09fbf3e6a0c881a", "https://github.com/x-stream/xstream", "https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2024-47072.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/12/msg00023.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47072", "GHSA-hfq9-hggm-c56q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ac96e2c1-6fed-39a5-8007-bd69b64bbc2b", "product": {"name": "xstream"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.21"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a92f0cb-738f-3df9-9802-cdfa333c9a02", "vendor": {"name": "x-stream"}}], "isExploited": false}
