The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue. Users unable to upgrade may maintain a blacklist themselves in the directory `external/serialize.blacklist`.", "datePublished": "2024-09-19T22:47:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-20T14:02:54", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian/security/advisories/GHSA-c459-2m73-67hj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-46983", "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian/commit/764ef4b216aee6aeb4b111aec8947a4e8b53bb87", "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-46983", "GHSA-c459-2m73-67hj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6951ff6a-b198-3712-88dc-aa69e66f8fc2", "product": {"name": "sofa-hessian"}, "product_version": "< 3.5.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dbd9f09d-4e11-391c-9e9d-674e5ceb7448", "vendor": {"name": "sofastack"}}], "isExploited": false}
