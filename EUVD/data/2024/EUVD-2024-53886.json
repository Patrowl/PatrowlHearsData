This is due to the missing input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into form fields that get executed on the server during the export, potentially leading to a complete site compromise. \r\nAs a prerequisite, the custom export field should include fields containing user-supplied data.", "datePublished": "2025-02-07T15:21:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T17:14:14", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/40b57370-4fd7-4316-9e99-a3f1d34616e8?source=cve", "https://www.wpallimport.com/upgrade-to-wp-all-export-pro/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7419"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3930f90c-7bc2-3075-ab8f-420e014e7ddb", "product": {"name": "WP All Export Pro"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.9.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e5d991d6-b1a3-3554-abd0-ecad46f4fc29", "vendor": {"name": "WP All Import"}}], "isExploited": false}
