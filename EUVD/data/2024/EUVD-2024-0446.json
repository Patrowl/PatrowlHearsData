Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`.", "datePublished": "2024-01-04T20:09:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T22:27:35", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21636", "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1950", "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1962", "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/0d26944a8d2730ea40e60eae23d70684483e5017", "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/c43d8bafa7117cbce479669a423ab266de150697", "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/view_component/CVE-2024-21636.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21636", "GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7bca5bd8-5802-3089-a119-974f3b65e8a0", "product": {"name": "view_component"}}, {"id": "a054b210-1257-3f39-8659-2516467f59fa", "product": {"name": "view_component"}, "product_version": "< 2.83.0"}, {"id": "b8321f0e-8d9b-31b7-b432-7a59c1f21b00", "product": {"name": "view_component"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "13491b43-9bc6-34cb-93c7-9a4929c80d61", "vendor": {"name": "ViewComponent"}}], "isExploited": false}
