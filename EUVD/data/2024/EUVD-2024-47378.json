This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on form submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit forms intended for public use as another user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. On sites where unfiltered_html is enabled, this can lead to the admin unknowingly adding a Stored Cross-Site Scripting payload.", "datePublished": "2024-08-08T06:30:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-01T03:30:56", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/75ec04f1-8bea-4514-b1d0-da5b305219d7?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3129495%40brizy%2Ftrunk&old=3125955%40brizy%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6254"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-6254"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c35342a3-a9e1-33ed-a9c3-02b16c7335ca", "product": {"name": "Brizy \u2013 Page Builder"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "13615c04-3d16-3bc2-95d7-3564de0f4bf0", "vendor": {"name": "themefusecom"}}], "isExploited": false}
