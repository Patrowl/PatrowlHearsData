In other words, dnspython does not have the preferred behavior in which the DNS name resolution algorithm would proceed, within the full time window, in order to wait for a valid packet. NOTE: dnspython 2.6.0 is unusable for a different reason that was addressed in 2.6.1.", "datePublished": "2024-04-11T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T17:12:31", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29483", "https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/913", "https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/issues/1045", "https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/commit/51e3c4928d4938beb576eff34f3bf97e6e64e6b4", "https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/commit/0ea5ad0a4583e1f519b9bcc67cfac381230d9cf2", "https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet", "https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/releases/tag/v0.35.2", "https://github.com/rthalley/dnspython/releases/tag/v2.6.0", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NLRKR57IFVKQC2GCXZBFLCLBAWBWL3F6", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOHJOO3OM65UIUUUVDEXMCTXNM6LXZEH", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X3BNSIK5NFYSAP53Y45GOCMOQHHDLGIF", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0001", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-DNSPYTHON-6241713", "https://www.dnspython.org", "https://www.dnspython.org/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOHJOO3OM65UIUUUVDEXMCTXNM6LXZEH/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240510-0001/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NLRKR57IFVKQC2GCXZBFLCLBAWBWL3F6/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X3BNSIK5NFYSAP53Y45GOCMOQHHDLGIF/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29483", "GHSA-3rq5-2g8h-59hc"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 4.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8bbde6b0-09c8-30c0-a637-01e0407e754a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f51a3624-99d4-39b8-89a1-63c01b6e9661", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
