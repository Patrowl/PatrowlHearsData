This conditional check was being honored before validating if the anonymous access is indeed allowed on the metadata of an object. This issue has been addressed in commit `e0fe7cc3917`. Users must upgrade to RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z for the fix. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-05-28T18:50:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T15:28:54", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-95fr-cm4m-q5p9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36107", "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/19810", "https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/e0fe7cc391724fc5baa85b45508f425020fe4272", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Modified-Since", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Unmodified-Since", "https://github.com/minio/minio"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-36107", "GHSA-95fr-cm4m-q5p9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "442edd0f-8ae7-36a9-8fe8-07088ee3b716", "product": {"name": "minio"}, "product_version": "< RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e63af0da-807e-3669-bf5b-c5afb32b9d6e", "vendor": {"name": "minio"}}], "isExploited": false}
