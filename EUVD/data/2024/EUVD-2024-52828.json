Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerability's only known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-07T22:23:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T17:18:47", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5cch-jr52-qffh", "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/e70efcbd60ce62f06e77c183b362c74e636c02d9", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_clobbering"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55630"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "611bfa5a-f80b-37e1-a81a-f2e045a4a87a", "product": {"name": "joplin"}, "product_version": "< 3.2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d0c8fc4a-4d03-3ea1-b315-1f6c15a144b2", "vendor": {"name": "laurent22"}}], "isExploited": false}
