Attackers could use the potentially predictable nonce value used for authentication purposes in the OAuth flow to conduct OAuth replay attacks. In addition, insecure randomness is used while generating multifactor authentication (MFA) secrets and creating API keys in the database package.", "datePublished": "2024-02-17T05:00:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T13:47:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21495", "https://github.com/greenpau/caddy-security/issues/265", "https://github.com/greenpau/go-authcrunch/commit/ecd3725baf2683eb1519bb3c81ae41085fbf7dc2", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GITHUBCOMGREENPAUCADDYSECURITY-6248275", "github.com/greenpau/caddy-security", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/09/18/security-flaws-in-an-sso-plugin-for-caddy/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21495", "GHSA-c7vf-m394-m4x4"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1593b87b-cc1b-3b19-aebb-17db2cef874e", "product": {"name": "github.com/greenpau/caddy-security"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6700ffff-0f93-3163-9be8-2e87b43a8b63", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
