Potentially this could be combined with vulnerabilities in other components to achieve remote code execution.\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.", "datePublished": "2024-02-27T14:29:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T16:13:10", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread/564kbv3wqdzkscmdn2bg4vlk48qymryp", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/27/3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27905"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 3.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b7160ef-c736-3167-84ee-869dc89cea2c", "product": {"name": "Apache Aurora"}}, {"id": "fda86414-441a-3ec8-a59c-cf7dd80a134f", "product": {"name": "Apache Aurora"}, "product_version": "0.5.0 \u2264*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1533a9e0-188b-3996-b3c8-48f7bd02ec3c", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
