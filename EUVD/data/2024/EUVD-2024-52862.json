A vulnerability in the user management endpoint `/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` allows an \"Admin\" role user to remove a \"Root\" user from the organization. This violates the intended privilege hierarchy, enabling a non-root user to remove the highest-privileged account. Due to insufficient role checks, the `remove_user_from_org` function does not prevent an \"Admin\" user from removing a \"Root\" user. As a result, an attacker with an \"Admin\" role can remove critical \"Root\" users, potentially gaining effective full control by eliminating the highest-privileged accounts. The `DELETE /api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}` endpoint is affected. This issue has been addressed in release version `0.14.1` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-01-16T19:30:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T20:31:21", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-m8gj-6r85-3r6m", "https://github.com/gaby/openobserve/blob/main/src/service/users.rs#L631"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-55954"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89596f87-12d2-3397-a808-04b25396e898", "product": {"name": "openobserve"}, "product_version": "< 0.14.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c375cce2-a3b1-34f4-9f4a-87e2fb7fcd3b", "vendor": {"name": "openobserve"}}], "isExploited": false}
