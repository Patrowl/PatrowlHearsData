A vulnerability introduced in WooCommerce 8.8 allows for cross-site scripting. A bad actor can manipulate a link to include malicious HTML & JavaScript content. While the content is not saved to the database, the links may be sent to victims for malicious purposes. The injected JavaScript could hijack content & data stored in the browser, including the session. The URL content is read through the `Sourcebuster.js` library and then inserted without proper sanitization to the classic checkout and registration forms. Versions 8.8.5 and 8.9.3 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may disable the Order Attribution feature.", "datePublished": "2024-06-12T15:05:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:50:56", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/security/advisories/GHSA-cv23-q6gh-xfrf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37297", "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/0e9888305d0cb9557e58f558526ab11cb3bcc4b4", "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/commit/915e32a42762916b745a7e663c8b69a698da8b67", "https://developer.woocommerce.com/2024/06/10/developer-advisory-xss-vulnerability-8-8-0", "https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-37297", "GHSA-cv23-q6gh-xfrf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2bf06eeb-b2c4-37d1-9246-797f324918be", "product": {"name": "WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "8.8.0, < 8.8.5"}, {"id": "bba7f750-5afb-32e6-9240-3f00490ad9a9", "product": {"name": "WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "8.9.0, < 8.9.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a08cb22a-e7cb-32e4-8659-550af77f7eee", "vendor": {"name": "WooCommerce"}}], "isExploited": false}
