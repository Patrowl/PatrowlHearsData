The affected application does not properly limit the size of specific logs. This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to exhaust system resources by creating a great number of log entries which could potentially lead to a denial of service condition. A successful exploitation requires the attacker to have access to specific SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager Clients in the deployment.", "datePublished": "2024-05-14T10:02:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T02:36:03", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/html/ssa-093430.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-33495"], "assigner": "siemens", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5b7bbb97-5176-314b-9914-51808ff27430", "product": {"name": "SIMATIC RTLS Locating Manager"}, "product_version": "0 <V3.0.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7276c88d-bdc0-38cc-875d-8ca7b9251f60", "vendor": {"name": "Siemens"}}], "isExploited": false}
