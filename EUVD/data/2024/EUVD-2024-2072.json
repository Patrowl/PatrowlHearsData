Minder's Git provider is vulnerable to a denial of service from a maliciously configured GitHub repository. The Git provider clones users repositories using the `github.com/go-git/go-git/v5` library on lines `L55-L89`. The Git provider does the following on the lines `L56-L62`. First, it sets the `CloneOptions`, specifying the url, the depth etc. It then validates the options. It then sets up an in-memory filesystem, to which it clones and Finally, it clones the repository. The `(g *Git) Clone()` method is vulnerable to a DoS attack: A Minder user can instruct Minder to clone a large repository which will exhaust memory and crash the Minder server. The root cause of this vulnerability is a combination of the following conditions: 1. Users can control the Git URL which Minder clones, 2. Minder does not enforce a size limit to the repository, 3. Minder clones the entire repository into memory. This issue has been addressed in commit `7979b43` which has been included in release version v0.0.52. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-06-18T17:07:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:04:23", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/stacklok/minder/security/advisories/GHSA-hpcg-xjq5-g666", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-37904", "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/35bab8f9a6025eea9e6e3cef6bd80707ac03d2a9", "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/commit/7979b43", "https://github.com/stacklok/minder", "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L55-L89", "https://github.com/stacklok/minder/blob/85985445c8ac3e51f03372e99c7b2f08a6d274aa/internal/providers/git/git.go#L56-L62"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-37904", "GHSA-hpcg-xjq5-g666"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0950905c-cddd-3a13-9fda-7cba995f2476", "product": {"name": "minder"}, "product_version": "< 0.0.52"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a121e07-f97a-33c0-8862-11d965e3ba93", "vendor": {"name": "stacklok"}}], "isExploited": false}
