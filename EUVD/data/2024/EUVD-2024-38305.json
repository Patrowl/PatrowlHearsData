A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) or, due to the default CSP, HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in the admin dashboard. This potentially allows an authenticated attacker to inject malicious code into the dashboard, which is then executed or rendered in the context of an administrator's browser when viewing the injected content. However, it is important to note that the default Content Security Policy (CSP) of the application blocks most exploitation paths, significantly mitigating the potential impact.", "datePublished": "2024-09-13T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-18T18:51:04", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/blob/1.30.3/src/static/scripts/admin_users.js#L201", "https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/releases/tag/1.32.0", "https://www.mgm-sp.com/cve/html-injection-in-vaultwarden"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39926"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d0319949-3a6b-3449-99bf-90ea6c65c37f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b690d701-e4a7-3c64-bbd6-ce8f3919b86e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
