Prior to version 1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection vulnerabilities, remote code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue with the `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the plugin_hooks and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is directly used to concatenate the file path which is used for file inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-05-13T15:11:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-16T18:13:18", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cx8g-hvq8-p2rv", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gj3f-p326-gh8r", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-pfh9-gwm6-86vp", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-31459"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c93e18d-ef21-38c7-88cc-860723be5396", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.27"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d93ee1b-5df5-3614-ad2a-5da8f26e439b", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
