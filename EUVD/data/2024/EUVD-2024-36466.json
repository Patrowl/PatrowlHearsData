All users relying on .npmrc are potentially affected by this vulnerability if their private registry references tarball URLs at a different domain. This includes usage of deno install subcommand, auto-install for npm: specifiers and LSP usage. It is recommended to upgrade to Deno 1.44.1 and if your private registry ever serves tarballs at a different domain to rotate your registry credentials.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T15:28:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T03:50:54", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-rfc6-h225-3vxv", "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/566adb7c0a0c0845e90a6e867a2c0ef5d2ada575", "https://github.com/npm/cli/wiki/%22No-auth-for-URI,-but-auth-present-for-scoped-registry%22"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-37150"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9851a650-116b-37ab-9d52-f15ec44f393c", "product": {"name": "deno"}, "product_version": "= 1.44.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "acf6e62c-27d8-332f-adac-ce8c18f2e928", "vendor": {"name": "denoland"}}], "isExploited": false}
