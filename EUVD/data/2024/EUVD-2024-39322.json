An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c module, where the snmp_message_decode function fails to check the boundary of the message buffer when reading a byte from it immediately after decoding an object identifier (OID). The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request 2937. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.", "datePublished": "2024-11-27T18:20:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-27T19:22:41", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-444j-93j3-5gj4", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2937"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41126"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b62632d2-87f7-37a3-a189-0b0d7714c035", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bf49f450-ee29-3013-8f1a-e0705a9e54b1", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
