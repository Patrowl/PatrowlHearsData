The cluster-manager deployment uses a service account with the same name \"cluster-manager\" which is bound to a ClusterRole also named \"cluster-manager\", which includes the permission to create Pod resources. If this deployment runs a pod on an attacker-controlled node, the attacker can obtain the cluster-manager's token and steal any service account token by creating and mounting the target service account to control the whole cluster.", "datePublished": "2024-12-17T22:59:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T19:59:25", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9779", "https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/registration-operator/issues/361", "https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/pull/325", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-9779", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2317916", "https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/OCM", "https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/releases/tag/v0.13.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9779", "GHSA-jhh6-6fhp-q2xp"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e59faf7-0a0d-3e3d-8f23-ca18d4de5f26", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
