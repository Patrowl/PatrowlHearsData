CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 was found to leak users secret keys and access keys in the logs in multiple components. When CubeCS creates new users, it leaks the users secret key. This could allow a lower-privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than themselves. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation than upgrading CubeFS.", "datePublished": "2024-01-03T16:25:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-03T14:43:24", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/security/advisories/GHSA-vwch-g97w-hfg2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46742", "https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs/commit/8dccce6ac8dff3db44d7e9074094c7303a5ff5dd", "https://github.com/cubefs/cubefs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46742", "GHSA-vwch-g97w-hfg2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "48f06478-a5f6-3904-ba81-b635a29ffc38", "product": {"name": "cubefs"}, "product_version": "< 3.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "559ddcdc-d74c-3f74-9b54-d2101f372f53", "vendor": {"name": "cubefs"}}], "isExploited": false}
