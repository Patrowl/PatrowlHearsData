Random characters being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore, result in a security issue if the users are using the \u2018ID card self-registration\u2019 function.", "datePublished": "2024-09-16T06:59:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T14:33:10", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:P/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://ntware.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SA/pages/11973853216/2024+Security+Advisory+Multiple+MiCard+PLUS+card+reader+dropped+characters", "https://www.canon-europe.com/psirt/advisory-information"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-1578"], "assigner": "Canon_EMEA", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "43431def-287a-32b9-b1ac-bceb5257f582", "product": {"name": "MiCard PLUS BLE"}, "product_version": "0.1.0.4"}, {"id": "8bd4b039-dabb-3c91-afd6-3182d8df39ee", "product": {"name": "MiCard PLUS Ci"}, "product_version": "0.1.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7dfc996c-e519-3f89-a505-175590c225ce", "vendor": {"name": "Rebranded by NT-ware (originally developed and provided by rf IDEAS)"}}], "isExploited": false}
