In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-02-13T18:46:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-10T19:00:12", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv", "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T7DKVEVREYAI4F46CQAVOTPL75WLOZOE/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00004.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24814"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "287e3522-c961-3fbb-aa7a-d97d6b09b30b", "product": {"name": "mod_auth_openidc"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.4.15.2"}, {"id": "2d01c425-b240-3525-8f21-53f3fa0f22e3", "product": {"name": "mod_auth_openidc"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f0fc07d7-2445-3832-a169-6e7b1a5378c6", "vendor": {"name": "OpenIDC"}}], "isExploited": false}
