Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.", "datePublished": "2024-05-06T23:42:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T19:25:42", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/a3c69faf-cca0-4c10-8739-57e5bef7a95f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-2913"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4a5bda81-2b6c-31c6-b337-89978e5f7ffc", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "770de0e3-eacb-35e9-bd0d-91db1f629dc9", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
