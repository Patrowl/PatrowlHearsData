When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.\n", "datePublished": "2024-06-03T14:25:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T14:44:12", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/dain/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-36124", "https://github.com/dain/snappy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-36124", "GHSA-8wh2-6qhj-h7j9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2fd02ed5-dc5e-3002-8efb-aac61c8da3c3", "product": {"name": "snappy"}, "product_version": "< 0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "12f95e98-e9e3-35d4-876b-02711eea1a7e", "vendor": {"name": "dain"}}], "isExploited": false}
