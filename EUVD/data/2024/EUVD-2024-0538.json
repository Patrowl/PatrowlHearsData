A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7) where an attacker may construct a JDBC query which may read files on the host filesystem. Due to the newer MySQL driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30), there is no associated deserialization utilization point, so original code execution cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server. This issue has been addressed in version 3.7.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-02-12T20:15:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-07T21:02:47", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/security/advisories/GHSA-6p92-qfqf-qwx4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-23833", "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/commit/41ccf574847d856e22488a7c0987ad8efa12a84a", "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-23833", "GHSA-6p92-qfqf-qwx4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0dc34e32-26c0-35e9-8d80-bc7716bd42a0", "product": {"name": "OpenRefine"}, "product_version": "< 3.7.8"}, {"id": "37979012-e701-3595-8bfb-89e3ccef2996", "product": {"name": "OpenRefine"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "37979012-e701-3595-8bfb-89e3ccef2996", "vendor": {"name": "OpenRefine"}}], "isExploited": false}
