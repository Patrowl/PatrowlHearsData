An OOB-read vulnerability has been found in the parse_ds64 function within gstwavparse.c. The parse_ds64 function does not check that the buffer buf contains sufficient data before attempting to read from it, doing multiple GST_READ_UINT32_LE operations without performing boundary checks. This can lead to an OOB-read when buf is smaller than expected. This vulnerability allows reading beyond the bounds of the data buffer, potentially leading to a crash (denial of service) or the leak of sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.", "datePublished": "2024-12-11T19:15:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:40:47", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2024-261_Gstreamer/", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/8042.patch", "https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2024-0027.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47775"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5b8911b0-b430-3b0f-ae58-aa1525131ddd", "product": {"name": "GStreamer"}, "product_version": "< 1.24.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86206a4a-2c6a-396b-975b-6e4010d423e9", "vendor": {"name": "GStreamer"}}], "isExploited": false}
