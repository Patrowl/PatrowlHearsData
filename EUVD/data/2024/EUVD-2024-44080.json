This could result in a partial loss of data integrity. In Guardian/CMC instances with a reporting configuration, there could be limited Denial of Service (DoS) impacts, as the reports may not reach their intended destination, and there could also be limited information disclosure impacts. Furthermore, modifying the destination SMTP server for the reports could lead to the compromise of external credentials, as they might be sent to an unauthorized server. This could expand the scope of the attack.", "datePublished": "2024-09-11T14:45:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-20T12:21:58", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://security.nozominetworks.com/NN-2024:2-01"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4465"], "assigner": "Nozomi", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19adb6dd-23ab-38bf-b51e-94f8daf95442", "product": {"name": "Guardian"}, "product_version": "0 <24.2.0"}, {"id": "b7307900-dfee-3505-ae5c-9e4f0ceb7c17", "product": {"name": "CMC"}, "product_version": "0 <24.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6f1e6181-1e1e-3c8a-a631-998743f8ac81", "vendor": {"name": "Nozomi Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
