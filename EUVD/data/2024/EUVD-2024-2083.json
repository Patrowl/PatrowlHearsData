This vulnerability arises from the application's failure to properly validate URI fragments for directory traversal sequences such as '../'. An attacker can exploit this flaw by manipulating the fragment part of the URI to read arbitrary files on the local file system, including sensitive files like '/etc/passwd'. The vulnerability is a bypass to a previous patch that only addressed similar manipulation within the URI's query string, highlighting the need for comprehensive validation of all parts of a URI to prevent LFI attacks.", "datePublished": "2024-06-06T19:15:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-08T10:23:24", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2928", "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/96f0b573a73d8eedd6735a2ce26e08859527be07", "https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow", "https://huntr.com/bounties/19bf02d7-6393-4a95-b9d0-d6d4d2d8c298"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-2928", "GHSA-j46q-5pxx-8vmw"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 90.8, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "992aaa31-edaa-3300-be69-5f6500d82691", "product": {"name": "mlflow/mlflow"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.11.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "29bd221f-ea46-3bcb-93ec-a0bd290ff197", "vendor": {"name": "mlflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
