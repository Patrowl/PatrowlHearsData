This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. NOTE: The vulnerable code in this plugin is specifically tied to the tagDiv Newspaper theme. If another theme is installed (e.g., NewsMag), this code may not be present.", "datePublished": "2024-06-04T04:30:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:26:57", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/466fc6f3-7b2d-4975-a838-16e27bc9f9b5?source=cve", "https://tagdiv.com/newspaper/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-3888"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "204cf467-ab74-3c61-b200-44c1ebe0e978", "product": {"name": "tagDiv Composer"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d909c15a-0226-31d7-8b1f-9a50487f8427", "vendor": {"name": "tagDiv"}}], "isExploited": false}
