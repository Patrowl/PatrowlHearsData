A potential mutation XSS vulnerability exists in Qwik for versions up to but not including 1.6.0. Qwik improperly escapes HTML on server-side rendering. It converts strings according to the rules found in the `render-ssr.ts` file. It sometimes causes the situation that the final DOM tree rendered on browsers is different from what Qwik expects on server-side rendering. This may be leveraged to perform XSS attacks, and a type of the XSS is known as mXSS (mutation XSS). This has been resolved in qwik version 1.6.0 and @builder.io/qwik version 1.7.3. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-08-06T17:52:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-08T19:04:29", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/security/advisories/GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-41677", "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/commit/7e742eb3a1001542d795776c0317d47df8b9d64e", "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik", "https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/v1.5.5/packages/qwik/src/core/render/ssr/render-ssr.ts#L1182-L1208"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-41677", "GHSA-2rwj-7xq8-4gx4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "559a89d3-c984-37aa-a824-ca64fff3af42", "product": {"name": "qwik"}, "product_version": "@builder.io/qwik: < 1.7.3"}, {"id": "d98390f9-8b65-38e9-8499-8cb6c2b131fd", "product": {"name": "qwik"}, "product_version": "qwik: < 1.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b3eb359-929a-3ccd-8b2e-9c98d56ff633", "vendor": {"name": "QwikDev"}}], "isExploited": false}
