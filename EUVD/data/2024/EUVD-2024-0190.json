In versions 0.8.3 and prior, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes them to the `send` method which sends a `GET` request on lines 339-343 in `requests.py`. The returned contents of the URL are then passed to and reflected back to the user in the `send_file` function on line 484, together with the user-controlled `src_type`, which allows the attacker to control the HTTP response content type leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could craft a special URL to point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the link.The malicious website could, for example, be a copy of a real website, meant to steal a person\u2019s credentials to the website, or trick that person in another way. Version 0.8.4 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-01-23T08:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-01-30T12:21:01", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-186_GHSL-2023-189_benbusby_whoogle-search/", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-186_GHSL-2023-189_benbusby_whoogle-search/", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/commit/3a2e0b262e4a076a20416b45e6b6f23fd265aeda", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/blob/92e8ede24e9277a5440d403f75877209f1269884/app/request.py#L339-L343", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/blob/92e8ede24e9277a5440d403f75877209f1269884/app/routes.py#L465-L490", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/blob/92e8ede24e9277a5440d403f75877209f1269884/app/routes.py#L466", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/blob/92e8ede24e9277a5440d403f75877209f1269884/app/routes.py#L476", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/blob/92e8ede24e9277a5440d403f75877209f1269884/app/routes.py#L479", "https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search/blob/92e8ede24e9277a5440d403f75877209f1269884/app/routes.py#L484C6-L484C7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22417", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/whoogle-search/PYSEC-2024-19.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-22417", "PYSEC-2024-19"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6480a37c-91a9-339b-b749-45824a918aad", "product": {"name": "whoogle-search"}, "product_version": "< 0.8.4"}, {"id": "f76464d4-9242-3a32-a098-bc38b7118080", "product": {"name": "whoogle-search"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7705b6d7-cfcc-35b4-a837-06e828af9049", "vendor": {"name": "benbusby"}}], "isExploited": false}
