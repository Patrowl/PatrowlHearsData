This information is gathered by looking up the value of `document.currentScript.src`. Prior to Pagefind version 1.1.1, it is possible to \"clobber\" this lookup with otherwise benign HTML on the page. This will cause `document.currentScript.src` to resolve as an external domain, which will then be used by Pagefind to load dependencies. This exploit would only work in the case that an attacker could inject HTML to a live, hosted, website. In these cases, this would act as a way to escalate the privilege available to an attacker. This assumes they have the ability to add some elements to the page (for example, `img` tags with a `name` attribute), but not others, as adding a `script` to the page would itself be the cross-site scripting vector. Pagefind has tightened this resolution in version 1.1.1 by ensuring the source is loaded from a valid script element. There are no reports of this being exploited in the wild via Pagefind.", "datePublished": "2024-09-03T19:30:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T20:03:17", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/security/advisories/GHSA-gprj-6m2f-j9hx", "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45389", "https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/commit/14ec96864eabaf1d7d809d5da0186a8856261eeb", "https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45389", "GHSA-gprj-6m2f-j9hx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d47a285-fd92-3bf7-aeda-97f72f4608fd", "product": {"name": "pagefind"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17927199-195e-34e9-8181-eda8a55fa53b", "vendor": {"name": "CloudCannon"}}], "isExploited": false}
