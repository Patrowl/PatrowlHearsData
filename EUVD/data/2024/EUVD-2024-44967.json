In addition, the Elefant installer registers two\n Firebird database services which are running as \u201cNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\u201d.\u00a0\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbserver.exe\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbguard.exe\n\n\nBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local \nattacker can rename one of the service binaries, replace the service \nexecutable with a new executable, and then restart the system. Once the \nsystem has rebooted, the new service binary is executed as \"NT \nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\".", "datePublished": "2024-11-08T11:45:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T22:28:27", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://r.sec-consult.com/hasomed", "https://hasomed.de/produkte/elefant/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50590", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Nov/3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-50590"], "assigner": "SEC-VLab", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "436827da-fd91-3e3b-ab36-e5ebc5f0a5ed", "product": {"name": "Elefant"}, "product_version": "<24.04.00"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a1b732d-2d73-317e-94ad-eb40e0ab6f68", "vendor": {"name": "HASOMED"}}], "isExploited": false}
