A third-party malicious application installed on the same phone can force Element Android, version 0.91.0 through 1.6.12, to share files stored under the `files` directory in the application's private data directory to an arbitrary room. The impact of the attack is reduced by the fact that the databases stored in this folder are encrypted. However, it contains some other potentially sensitive information, such as the FCM token. Forks of Element Android which have set `android:exported=\"false\"` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for the `IncomingShareActivity` activity are not impacted. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-02-20T18:30:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T23:59:32", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/security/advisories/GHSA-8wj9-cx7h-pvm4", "https://github.com/element-hq/element-android/commit/8f9695a9a8d944cb9b92568cbd76578c51d32e07", "https://element.io/blog/security-release-element-android-1-6-12"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-26132"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "841369ed-e3f1-3288-b6b3-11139c09a19f", "product": {"name": "element-android"}}, {"id": "c90cf93f-7882-3578-ae27-12efa0ebe584", "product": {"name": "element-android"}, "product_version": "0.91.0, < 1.6.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7ce00dbd-f8f6-3179-b32a-600b4b8ce313", "vendor": {"name": "element-hq"}}], "isExploited": false}
