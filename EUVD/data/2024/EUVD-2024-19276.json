By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.\n", "datePublished": "2024-01-10T21:44:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-03T14:27:29", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Azure/ipam/security/advisories/GHSA-m8mp-jq4c-g8j6", "https://github.com/Azure/ipam/pull/218", "https://github.com/Azure/ipam/commit/64ef2d07edf16ffa50f29c7e0e25d32d974b367f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-21638"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dcc6bcbe-cc3e-39ff-a5ac-b31453d0e989", "product": {"name": "ipam"}}, {"id": "e363e2f3-4bac-37ce-9116-9c0207833142", "product": {"name": "ipam"}, "product_version": "< 3.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ce94ec04-b8c6-3735-bcce-a955d06cd343", "vendor": {"name": "Azure"}}], "isExploited": false}
