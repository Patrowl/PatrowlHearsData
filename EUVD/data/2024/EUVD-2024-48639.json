This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read and delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2024-08-20T03:21:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-20T13:14:05", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4deb128d-0163-4a8e-9591-87352f74c3ef?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bit-form/tags/2.13.3/includes/Admin/AdminAjax.php#L829", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bit-form/tags/2.13.3/includes/Admin/AdminAjax.php#L852", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bit-form/tags/2.13.3/includes/Admin/AdminAjax.php#L875", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bit-form/tags/2.13.3/includes/Admin/AdminAjax.php#L898"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7777"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 3.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "284aa6d9-a071-3204-a548-bc0f1e2c9395", "product": {"name": "Contact Form by Bit Form: Multi Step Form, Calculation Contact Form, Payment Contact Form & Custom Contact Form builder"}, "product_version": "2.0 \u22642.13.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "43587eaa-63c4-3ed7-9ac9-7cfef0e151d3", "vendor": {"name": "bitpressadmin"}}], "isExploited": false}
