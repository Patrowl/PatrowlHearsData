Cersions on the 10.x, 11.x, 12.x, 13.x, and 14.x branches before version 14.2.7 contain a vulnerability in the image optimization feature which allows for a potential Denial of Service (DoS) condition which could lead to excessive CPU consumption. Neither the `next.config.js` file that is configured with `images.unoptimized` set to `true` or `images.loader` set to a non-default value nor the Next.js application that is hosted on Vercel are affected. This issue was fully patched in Next.js `14.2.7`. As a workaround, ensure that the `next.config.js` file has either `images.unoptimized`, `images.loader` or `images.loaderFile` assigned.", "datePublished": "2024-10-14T18:04:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-15T14:52:10", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-g77x-44xx-532m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-47831", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/d11cbc9ff0b1aaefabcba9afe1e562e0b1fde65a", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-47831", "GHSA-g77x-44xx-532m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "50a52084-f724-3729-ab20-9c2eb4d32b5a", "product": {"name": "next.js"}, "product_version": "10.0.0, < 14.2.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96c8f27b-861d-3cbd-8693-33bb5a454859", "vendor": {"name": "vercel"}}], "isExploited": false}
