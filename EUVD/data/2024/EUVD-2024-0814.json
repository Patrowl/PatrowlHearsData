This vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings. The vulnerability can potentially be used to access files and directories on the host system. The full scope of impact is exactly unknown, but reading files outside of a server's base directory (sandbox root) is possible. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by Wings. Details on the exploitation of this vulnerability are embargoed until March 27th, 2024 at 18:00 UTC. In order to mitigate this vulnerability, a full rewrite of the entire server filesystem was necessary. Because of this, the size of the patch is massive, however effort was made to reduce the amount of breaking changes. Users are advised to update to version 1.11.9. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-03-13T20:28:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T00:27:59", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/security/advisories/GHSA-494h-9924-xww9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27102", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/commit/d1c0ca526007113a0f74f56eba99511b4e989287", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-27102", "GHSA-494h-9924-xww9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "372c518b-3f15-3ba6-912b-8a0b95d3dc45", "product": {"name": "wings"}}, {"id": "bfa2df1d-db78-31e7-a38f-bed43f09ce4f", "product": {"name": "wings"}, "product_version": "< 1.11.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da91e7c6-e5fc-3eeb-821d-378638c2ee6f", "vendor": {"name": "pterodactyl"}}], "isExploited": false}
