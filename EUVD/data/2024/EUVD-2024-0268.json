The revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a malicious verifier may be able to generate a unique identifier for a holder providing a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof. The impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a Non-Revocation proof. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.", "datePublished": "2024-01-16T21:44:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-16T19:46:20", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa/security/advisories/GHSA-6698-mhxx-r84g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-22192", "https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-clsignatures-rs/commit/1e55780c890b027fa51e361e188a7743a0bf473f", "https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/ursa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-22192", "GHSA-6698-mhxx-r84g"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3fb98c77-4aa6-3020-8a3e-b2694727a6af", "product": {"name": "ursa"}}, {"id": "840e3892-1b84-3400-950b-0a55c7d458bb", "product": {"name": "ursa"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.3.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b83e90db-973e-372a-aa88-a2e357aeca07", "vendor": {"name": "hyperledger-archives"}}], "isExploited": false}
