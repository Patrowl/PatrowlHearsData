This is due to improper authentication via the Social Login widget. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first user to have logged in with a social media account, including administrator accounts. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability even if the Social Login element has been disabled, as long as it was previously enabled and used. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.7.5, and fully patched in version 4.7.8.", "datePublished": "2024-09-26T04:29:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-26T14:08:53", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/efd279c2-9e95-45bd-9494-fb53a6333c65?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jupiterx-core/trunk/includes/extensions/raven/includes/modules/forms/classes/social-login-handler/google.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/jupiterx-core/trunk/includes/extensions/raven/includes/modules/forms/classes/social-login-handler/facebook.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3153667/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7781"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "481dea37-aa6f-357e-aca1-d028d60dd9bf", "product": {"name": "Jupiter X Core"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.7.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "72ecfe40-f0b0-3170-88c3-f1a023b9f5d6", "vendor": {"name": "artbees"}}], "isExploited": false}
