To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1, use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will allow \"escaping\" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.\n\n", "datePublished": "2024-02-01T19:02:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T23:19:52", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/security/advisories/GHSA-qh4g-4m4w-jgv2", "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/commit/b885b03c9cfae53d62d239037f9654d973dd54d9", "https://github.com/pixee/java-security-toolkit/blob/7c8e93e6fb2420fb6003c54a741e267c4f883bab/src/main/java/io/github/pixee/security/ZipSecurity.java#L82-L87"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24569"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a3d4211f-ca9c-3507-a1c8-8abe3cd8b034", "product": {"name": "java-security-toolkit"}}, {"id": "dbef8133-6029-323f-8cce-07475e27ca1f", "product": {"name": "java-security-toolkit"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c97ac102-49fe-3e8b-8a2b-6229b33de1e2", "vendor": {"name": "pixee"}}], "isExploited": false}
