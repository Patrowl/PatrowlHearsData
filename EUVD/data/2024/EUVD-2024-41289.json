Prior to the 2.9 branch, an attacker with only minimal viewing privileges in the settings section is able to change their user type to Administrator (or another type with super-permissions) through a specifically crafted POST request to `/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, modifying the `nivel_usuario_` parameter. The vulnerability occurs in the file located at `ieducar/intranet/educar_usuario_cad.php`, which does not check the user's current permission level before allowing changes. Commit c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2024-08-28T20:17:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-06T19:25:03", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/security/advisories/GHSA-53vj-fq8x-2mvg", "https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar/commit/c25910cdf11ab50e50162a49dd44bef544422b6e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45058"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 19.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6a4c884c-dbae-32e0-948a-b2a6b676f2fc", "product": {"name": "i-Educar"}, "product_version": "< 2.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8fb336d-449a-3c70-8887-16559f56cf65", "vendor": {"name": "Port\u00e1bilis"}}], "isExploited": false}
