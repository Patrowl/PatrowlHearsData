This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the add_chative_widget_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the channel ID or organization ID via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This could lead to redirecting the live chat widget to an attacker-controlled channel.", "datePublished": "2025-01-07T03:21:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-07T16:28:30", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/61d3cb97-f12b-4480-88fc-2bdcbf4cdae3?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/chative-live-chat-and-chatbot/trunk/chative-plugin.php#L51", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/chative-live-chat-and-chatbot/#developers"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12541"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "139a85d2-168d-3648-a741-ab7fae066882", "product": {"name": "Chative Live chat and Chatbot"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a2ce886c-b840-3142-9919-98bac7d1615c", "vendor": {"name": "chative"}}], "isExploited": false}
