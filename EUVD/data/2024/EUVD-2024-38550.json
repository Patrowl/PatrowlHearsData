{"id": "EUVD-2024-38550", "enisaUuid": "21de072e-8740-34d1-bbcf-df5718624f4a", "description": "OpenImageIO is a toolset for reading, writing, and manipulating image files of any image file format relevant to VFX / animation via a format-agnostic API with a feature set, scalability, and robustness needed for feature film production. In affected versions there is a bug in the heif input functionality of OpenImageIO. Specifically, in `HeifInput::seek_subimage()`.  In the worst case, this can lead to an information disclosure vulnerability, particularly for programs that directly use the `ImageInput` APIs. This bug has been addressed in commit `0a2dcb4c` which is included in the 2.5.13.1 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2024-07-15T19:15:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T04:33:11", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/security/advisories/GHSA-jjm9-9m4m-c8p2", "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/commit/0a2dcb4cf2c3fd4825a146cd3ad929d9d8305ce3", "https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/blob/7c486a1121a4bf71d50ff555fab2770294b748d7/src/heif.imageio/heifinput.cpp#L250"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-40630"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ce68b2d3-521f-3501-a3db-760d0c99ea33", "product": {"name": "OpenImageIO"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.13.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b11ab7ac-9121-3561-92d4-86defc133510", "vendor": {"name": "AcademySoftwareFoundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
