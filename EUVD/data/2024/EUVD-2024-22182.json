{"id": "EUVD-2024-22182", "enisaUuid": "6b005510-399f-3c4b-980e-2191e6fd3091", "description": "libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii` variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo` and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256 characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites (similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com` pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-02-07T21:44:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:40:29", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/libuv/libuv/security/advisories/GHSA-f74f-cvh7-c6q6", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/0f2d7e784a256b54b2385043438848047bc2a629", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/3530bcc30350d4a6ccf35d2f7b33e23292b9de70", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/c858a147643de38a09dd4164758ae5b685f2b488", "https://github.com/libuv/libuv/commit/e0327e1d508b8207c9150b6e582f0adf26213c39", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/08/2", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/11/1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00005.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240605-0008/", "https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/26112"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-24806"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a0f125b-ff5a-3622-9e39-ab10643ad255", "product": {"name": "libuv"}, "product_version": "1.45.0, < 1.48.0"}, {"id": "bd5007b1-3286-3c6e-a1d4-13c17886bde5", "product": {"name": "libuv"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd5007b1-3286-3c6e-a1d4-13c17886bde5", "vendor": {"name": "libuv"}}], "isExploited": false}
