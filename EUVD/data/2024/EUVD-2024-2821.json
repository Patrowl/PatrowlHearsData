This functionality allows trusted users to set up Druid lookups or run ingestion tasks. Druid also allows administrators to configure a list of allowed properties that users are able to provide for their JDBC connections. By default, this allowed properties list restricts users to TLS-related properties only. However, when configuration a MySQL JDBC connection, users can use a particularly-crafted JDBC connection string to provide properties that are not on this allow list.\n\nUsers without the permission to configure JDBC connections are not able to exploit this vulnerability.\nCVE-2021-26919 describes a similar vulnerability which was partially addressed in Apache Druid 0.20.2.\n\nThis issue is fixed in Apache Druid 30.0.1.", "datePublished": "2024-09-17T18:37:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-14T15:09:00", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45537", "https://github.com/apache/druid", "https://github.com/apache/druid/releases/tag/druid-30.0.1", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/2ovx1t77y6tlkhk5b42clp4vwo4c8cjv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45537", "GHSA-jh66-3545-vpm7"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6b71eb99-f7b5-317e-8e41-78a57d0fe0a3", "product": {"name": "Apache Druid"}, "product_version": "0 \u226430.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "04b10403-a070-3303-ac0c-ef8e1293742f", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
