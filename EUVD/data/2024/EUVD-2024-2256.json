The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port. A vulnerability present starting in version 2.19.0 and prior to version 2.39.2rc0 allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL. This could result in disclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version 2.39.2rc0. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2024-07-03T17:34:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T01:46:04", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-53q7-4874-24qg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31223", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/0555080541f18a5aacff452c590ac9a1b56d7097", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/cd510216b281de5443ec1c126add95cc5be0970a", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-31223", "GHSA-53q7-4874-24qg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 6.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cad906da-65ac-3e56-918c-5dbfc3dc301e", "product": {"name": "fides"}, "product_version": "2.19.0, < 2.39.2rc0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d33ae6d1-d4c0-368a-a200-bd33063c67e7", "vendor": {"name": "ethyca"}}], "isExploited": false}
