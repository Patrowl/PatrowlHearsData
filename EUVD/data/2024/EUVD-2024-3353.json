In versions prior to v1.49.0, the rate limiter could be bypassed by forging proxy headers allowing bad actors to send unlimited traffic to the site potentially causing a denial of service. In v1.49.0, a fix was implemented to only authorize proxies on local IPs which resolves this issue. As a workaround, one may add rules to one's proxy and/or firewall to not accept external proxy headers such as `X-Forwarded-*` from clients.", "datePublished": "2024-11-20T16:15:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T16:48:09", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/security/advisories/GHSA-ffp2-8p2h-4m5j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52796", "https://docs.pwpush.com/docs/proxies/#trusted-proxies", "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher", "https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/releases/tag/v1.49.0", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/pwpush/CVE-2024-52796.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52796", "GHSA-ffp2-8p2h-4m5j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cdf3776e-a2f8-35ab-b405-1342f44f04d6", "product": {"name": "PasswordPusher"}, "product_version": "< 1.49.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e144bb99-a3c7-36df-bfcf-8810c83bae33", "vendor": {"name": "pglombardo"}}], "isExploited": false}
