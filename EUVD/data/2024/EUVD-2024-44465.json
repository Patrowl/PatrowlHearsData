The vulnerability arises from the application's 'binding_zoo' feature, which allows attackers to upload and interact with a malicious model file hosted on hugging-face, leading to remote code execution. The issue is linked to a known vulnerability in llama-cpp-python, CVE-2024-34359, which has not been patched in lollms-webui as of commit b454f40a. The vulnerability is exploitable through the application's handling of model files in the 'bindings_zoo' feature, specifically when processing gguf format model files.", "datePublished": "2024-07-02T14:37:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-01T20:55:10", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/ecf386df-4b6a-40b2-9000-db0974355acc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-4897"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 1.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "217dbf2c-7c0b-335e-aa0d-abac0798f7a3", "product": {"name": "parisneo/lollms-webui"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264latest"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "842247fe-c12d-3128-b25d-22c04ad13886", "vendor": {"name": "parisneo"}}], "isExploited": false}
