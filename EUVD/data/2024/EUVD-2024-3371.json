Prior to version 5.17.0, assets uploaded with appropriately crafted filenames may result in them being placed in a location different than what was configured. The issue affects front-end forms with `assets` fields and other places where assets can be uploaded, although users would need upload permissions anyway. Files can be uploaded so they would be located on the server in a different location, and potentially override existing files. Traversal outside an asset container is not possible. This path traversal vulnerability has been fixed in 5.17.0.", "datePublished": "2024-11-19T16:30:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-03T17:18:17", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/statamic/cms/security/advisories/GHSA-p7f6-8mcm-fwv3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52600", "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/0c07c10009a2439c8ee56c8faefd1319dc6e388d", "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/400875b20f40e1343699d536a432a6fc284346da", "https://github.com/statamic/cms/commit/4cc2c9bd0f39a93b3fc7e9ef0f12792576fd380d", "https://github.com/statamic/cms"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-52600", "GHSA-p7f6-8mcm-fwv3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a8120d03-9219-3737-9940-a19d596cf693", "product": {"name": "CMS"}, "product_version": "< 5.17.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a429a3f4-1da3-31eb-b627-d3c8a27c79ea", "vendor": {"name": "statamic"}}], "isExploited": false}
