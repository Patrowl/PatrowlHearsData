A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.", "datePublished": "2024-05-13T19:22:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T02:59:22", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34707", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5697", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5698", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/4f0a66bd6307bfe0e0acb899233e0d4ad516f51c", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/f640aedc69c848d3d1be57f0300fc40033ff6423", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-34707", "GHSA-r2hr-4v48-fjv3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "405bf25b-16d2-3999-ab02-bc91ddd1a2ee", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.2.4"}, {"id": "90407f32-020d-3965-9b64-87ece6e87c68", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.22"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f2493f7f-be70-3a2b-bf90-f3391771afb1", "vendor": {"name": "nautobot"}}], "isExploited": false}
