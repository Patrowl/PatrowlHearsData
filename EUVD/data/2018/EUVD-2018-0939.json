The vulnerability is due to incorrect RADIUS user credential validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access a Cisco Policy Suite domain configured with RADIUS authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to be authorized as a subscriber without providing a valid password. This vulnerability affects the Cisco Policy Suite application running a release prior to 13.1.0 with Hotfix Patch 1 when RADIUS authentication is configured for a domain. Cisco Policy Suite Release 14.0.0 is also affected, as it includes vulnerable code, but RADIUS authentication is not officially supported in Cisco Policy Suite Releases 14.0.0 and later.
