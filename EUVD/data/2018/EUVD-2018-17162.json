ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the \"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result.", "datePublished": "2018-08-14T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T05:33:44", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307144"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5392"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f78ba7c7-b6bd-3afb-a96c-07314f07872e", "product": {"name": "mingw-w64"}, "product_version": "5.0.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be01c58b-6961-372f-b4db-65e8bc8ed9f0", "vendor": {"name": "mingw"}}], "isExploited": false}
