This allows an authenticated attacker, with permission to the Settings functionality, to inject arbitrary system commands within the application by manipulating the \"Cache directory\" path. An attacker can use it to perform malicious tasks such as to extract, change, or delete sensitive information or run system commands on the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2018-07-31T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T08:52:49", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.contextis.com/resources/advisories/cve-2018-12941", "https://sourceforge.net/p/seeddms/code/ci/seeddms-5.1.x/tree/CHANGELOG"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-12941"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "671bb525-9ef4-31c9-95eb-2c87301c6cbf", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cce2c533-5cea-3919-bb9d-f4b6be309993", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
