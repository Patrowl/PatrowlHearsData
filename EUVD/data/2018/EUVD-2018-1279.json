The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2018-10-17T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:25:26", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-nxos-snmp", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041921", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105668"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0456"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db0a9bf1-dee8-32b3-bbdb-dd6d378ea698", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 3000 Series 7.0(3)I7(3)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4fac8301-f9aa-3017-aa3a-bd2f98e7e9da", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
