The Audit Report module is affected by a blind XXE vulnerability when a new Best Practices Report is saved using a special payload inside the xml input field. The XXE vulnerability is blind since the response doesn't directly display a requested file, but rather returns it inside the name data field when the report is saved. An attacker is able to view restricted operating system files. This issue affects all types of users: administrators or normal users.", "datePublished": "2019-06-19T16:00:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T11:08:21", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.tufin.com/", "https://forum.tufin.com/support/kc/latest/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45808"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-18406"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e068f157-ccd1-3d38-8ea3-ea056c94bb94", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dd075d87-b34b-3af0-9e2d-d7682df1aef3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
