The vulnerability is due to the presence of a hidden command in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device via the console, forcing the device into ROMMON mode, and writing a malicious pattern to a specific memory address on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass signature validation checks by Cisco Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:36:16", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-catalyst6800", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105412"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15370"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fc983f0a-cb79-35f5-9b60-bbce6dde7f05", "product": {"name": "Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "defb28da-9439-3549-be3d-13df0fd9cd3a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
