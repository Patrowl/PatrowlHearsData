The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually result in a memory allocation failure that leads to a crash, triggering a reload of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:38:18", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-memleak", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105398", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0471"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "271ae46a-3759-38ea-a38c-b17b59e79bb4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a4dafe71-898f-352e-abdf-d2fb55a730d2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
