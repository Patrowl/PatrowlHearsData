The vulnerability is due to improper filtering of email messages that contain references to whitelisted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email message that contains a large number of whitelisted URLs. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a sustained DoS condition that could force the affected device to stop scanning and forwarding email messages.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:18:15", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106507", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-url-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15460"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f076c7bb-364d-33ed-b4eb-3b3a923e3f00", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f3e16a5-dba9-3af5-979f-3b1b4c36f54a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
