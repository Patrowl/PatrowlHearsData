The vulnerability is due to improper memory handling by the affected software when the software processes high rates of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets that are sent to a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust memory on the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:35:45", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105413", "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-19-094-03"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15373"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7dc6c5c0-4177-31b0-aa3c-5b87feaba8a4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bcc62abb-5356-329b-9fd4-7abc82f67f02", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
