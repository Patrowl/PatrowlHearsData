The issue is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames and pathnames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view system files on the targeted device, which may contain sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-17T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:24:27", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105671", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-traversal", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041926"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0420"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb9b48c1-8f9c-37b8-9237-5a85f867d1d7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4087a5b2-0841-315d-948a-aa1bb3de0be3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
