The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious command arguments into a vulnerable CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker, authenticated as a privileged user, to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. Note: On products that support multiple virtual device contexts (VDC), this vulnerability could allow an attacker to access files from any VDC. This vulnerability affects Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules.
