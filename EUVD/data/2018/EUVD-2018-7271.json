The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-11-08T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:22:45", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105858", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-sma-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15393"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f22e562-38f9-32b1-9b4f-89c29adcd42c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "307653fb-0191-39fb-9aee-f6a19cbba818", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
