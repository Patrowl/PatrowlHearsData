The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SIP packets in transit while NAT is performed on an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets via UDP port 5060 through an affected device that is performing NAT for SIP packets. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:37:24", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-sip-alg", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041734", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105419", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0476"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ef99c53a-9712-367f-9ecc-af40c87c7d26", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "44ababf1-7bd3-325b-9f28-0045b93fd996", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
