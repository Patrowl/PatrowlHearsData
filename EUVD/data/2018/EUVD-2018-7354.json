The SSL/TLS server certificate in the device to cloud communication was not verified by the device. As a result, an attacker in control of the network traffic of a device could have taken control of a device by intercepting and modifying commands issued from the server to the device in a Man-in-the-Middle attack. This included the ability to inject firmware update commands into the communication and cause the device to install maliciously modified firmware.", "datePublished": "2018-08-30T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T09:54:03", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.swisscom.ch/content/dam/swisscom/de/about/nachhaltigkeit/digitale-schweiz/sicherheit/bug-bounty/files/cve-2018-15476ff.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15476"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61aa6895-d7bd-38b0-8bf6-ce499d1cd1cb", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b364bbf8-b9be-39cb-93d8-1b11a7d357b5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
