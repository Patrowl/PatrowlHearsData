This is related to missing filename validation in the wp-includes/post.php wp_delete_attachment function. The attacker must have capabilities for files and posts that are normally available only to the Author, Editor, and Administrator roles. The attack methodology is to delete wp-config.php and then launch a new installation process to increase the attacker's privileges.", "datePublished": "2018-06-26T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T08:45:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4250", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-12895", "https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/wordpress-file-delete-to-code-execution/", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104569", "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9100", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/07/msg00046.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164633/WordPress-4.9.6-Arbitrary-File-Deletion.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-12895"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 88.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ad15d10e-a81e-3f78-9000-d0cc65e845d9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "30fae962-1cdf-3d35-bcbd-297bec09e049", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
