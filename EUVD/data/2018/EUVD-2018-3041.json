NOTE: there is no documentation stating that the web UI's logout feature was supposed to do anything beyond removing the cookie from one instance of a web browser; a client-side logout action is often not intended to address cases where a person has made a copy of a cookie outside of a browser.", "datePublished": "2018-05-14T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T07:54:35", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://medium.com/@AkshaySharmaUS/comcast-arris-touchstone-gateway-devices-are-vulnerable-heres-the-disclosure-7d603aa9342c", "https://medium.com/%40AkshaySharmaUS/comcast-arris-touchstone-gateway-devices-are-vulnerable-heres-the-disclosure-7d603aa9342c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-10990"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "77559d28-be37-3b69-8c96-e0b6b88bcc80", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bc5a736b-6379-3b71-a97e-a010ecbccba6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
