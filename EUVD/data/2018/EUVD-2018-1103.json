The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming RTP bitstreams. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted RTP bitstream to an affected Cisco Meeting Server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny audio and video services by causing media process crashes resulting in a DoS condition on the affected product. This vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server deployments that are running Cisco Meeting Server Software Releases 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.
