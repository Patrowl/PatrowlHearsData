However, if the type is in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.", "datePublished": "2018-01-31T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:25:53", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite/issues/159"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-6480"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22d4a7ee-ebb6-32c5-8db6-af947fadf19e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "598a3bdb-9392-3749-9856-23a0b865fe87", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
