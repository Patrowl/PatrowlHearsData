The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:26:35", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-webex-xss", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041793", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105557", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041794"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15436"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9fe12c2-9fc8-3186-8bea-39dd0c687f72", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Event Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b6fe4676-1187-3a49-b55a-d224e1306411", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
