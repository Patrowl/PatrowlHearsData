{"id": "EUVD-2018-4511", "enisaUuid": "6af1d7d1-ccde-3cbc-b293-9c4d41fb042f", "description": "When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password file will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty username. Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password files are unaffected by this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-03-27T17:26:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T08:38:06", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-12551.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4388", "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543401", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00035.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-12551"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b61f3e0-0950-3056-a24c-bb5499df1b86", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Mosquitto"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u22641.5.5"}, {"id": "4d4b9691-c1e9-3095-be9d-596b36868592", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Mosquitto"}, "product_version": "1.0 <unspecified"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c8186944-c79c-3a5f-b200-0a7b6f1b6070", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
