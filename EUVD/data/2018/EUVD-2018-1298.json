{"id": "EUVD-2018-1298", "enisaUuid": "43b4b225-d7fb-3bce-883d-1394c68da377", "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the cluster feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation when handling Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious CMP message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to crash and reload or to hang, resulting in a DoS condition. If the switch hangs it will not reboot automatically, and it will need to be power cycled manually to recover.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:37:37", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105404", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cmp", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0475"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b93dcc53-5a83-37c6-9b34-b3c32f3b28df", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3eab7947-2740-382d-8f91-d47eaf914b4b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
