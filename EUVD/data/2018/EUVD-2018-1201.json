The vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against PTP frame flood attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large streams of malicious IPv4 or IPv6 PTP traffic to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition, impacting the traffic passing through the device.", "datePublished": "2018-10-17T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:24:59", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041920", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105669", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-nexus-ptp-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0378"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "703e683e-31e1-3f05-a365-3c8a83f903ca", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 6000 Series"}, "product_version": "6.0(2)N1(2)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f6d3000-9dd2-3416-9fd3-894dc71b46ea", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
