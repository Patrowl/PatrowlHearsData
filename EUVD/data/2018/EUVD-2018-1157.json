The vulnerability is due to improper use of Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol and improper server certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by preparing malicious profile and localization files for Cisco AnyConnect to use. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely change the configuration profile, a certificate, or the localization data used by AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
