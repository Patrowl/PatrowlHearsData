The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:28:09", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-uc-xss", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041781"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15426"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6814bfdd-144d-3568-b3ca-1645a56d0608", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af24924e-f163-36f1-8e26-3b7e23bbb13e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
