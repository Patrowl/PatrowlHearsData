{"id": "EUVD-2018-1232", "enisaUuid": "06463a49-8479-30ce-8c2a-c561fd723db1", "description": "A vulnerability in the XCP Router service of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service (CUCM IM&P) and the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) and Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a temporary service outage for all IM&P users, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious IPv4 or IPv6 packet to an affected device on TCP port 7400. An exploit could allow the attacker to overread a buffer, resulting in a crash and restart of the XCP Router service.
