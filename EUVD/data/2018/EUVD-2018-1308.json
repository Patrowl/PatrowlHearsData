The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first connecting to the SM-1T3/E3 module console and entering a string sequence. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:36:42", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-sm1t3e3", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041736", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105433"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0485"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 4.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e797b85d-6811-3688-a008-21835e46da6f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d266ad8f-dbcc-3976-8c6f-de599566395b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
