The vulnerability occurs because the configuration of the Shell Access Filter, when used with a specific type of remote authentication, can cause a system file to have unbounded writes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of remote authentication requests to the appliance when the specific configuration is applied. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the device functions could operate abnormally, making the device unstable.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:18:26", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106516", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-fpwr-mc-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15458"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 4.65, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f8efc47b-08c5-3322-b091-f98c75bb8a32", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4fddc5a3-5262-3ee2-b81f-36c1298f4301", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
