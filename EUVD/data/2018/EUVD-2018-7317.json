The vulnerability exists because under specific circumstances, the affected software enables a privileged user account without notifying administrators of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this account to log in to an affected device and execute commands with full admin rights. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory will be updated with fixed software information once fixed software becomes available. There is a workaround to address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2018-11-08T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:22:19", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105873", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-sbsw-privacc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15439"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 40.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a2c10aae-39f0-3f37-87fe-887bf03bbcba", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "05aef2f5-5fab-395b-818e-3fc060ebe16f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
