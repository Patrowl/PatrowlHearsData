The vulnerability is due to incorrect TCP retransmission handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP connection request through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IPS rules and allow uninspected traffic onto the network.", "datePublished": "2018-11-08T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:22:11", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-fde-tcp-bypass", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105870"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15443"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1943e371-69de-3653-8138-26e4ee6682da", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b6c0071-7a0d-3f4f-98c9-47a6a160c14a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
