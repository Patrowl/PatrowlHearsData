The primary risk from this issue is with regards to domains that have been upgraded from Samba 4.8 and earlier. In these cases the manual testing done to confirm an organisation's password policies apply as expected may not have been re-done after the upgrade.", "datePublished": "2018-11-28T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:32:54", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16857.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2018-16857", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20181127-0001/", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-16857", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106024", "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-16857.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-52"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-16857"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 2.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b4ff96d9-18e6-31c7-97fb-19319862a166", "product": {"name": "Samba"}, "product_version": "4.9.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8bfb82fc-426d-3b8d-bda9-62689c0a7de9", "vendor": {"name": "[UNKNOWN]"}}], "isExploited": false}
