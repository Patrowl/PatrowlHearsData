The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has only the \\\"view\\\" permission (new in Django 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.", "datePublished": "2018-10-02T18:29:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-06-10T06:50:43", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2018/oct/01/security-release/", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041749", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190502-0009/", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6mx3-3vqg-hpp2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16984", "https://github.com/django/django/commit/bf39978a53f117ca02e9a0c78b76664a41a54745", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/django/PYSEC-2018-3.yaml", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200517123022/http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041749", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16984.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2018-16984"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-16984", "GHSA-6mx3-3vqg-hpp2", "PYSEC-2018-3"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c22be46f-a67d-3710-9a3f-0638b3b0ada4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1c658b9b-ff03-39b8-aa34-1a59e2b8b5eb", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
