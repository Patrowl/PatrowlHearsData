User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of specially crafted pdf files with embedded u3d images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-5677 and CVE-2018-5679.", "datePublished": "2018-05-24T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T05:40:51", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0016/", "https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104300"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5680"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e6867c4f-7ea8-335e-a6d3-7b41145700dd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6b02c948-e958-3198-b001-89fe1d26c13f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
