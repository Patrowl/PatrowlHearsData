Due to loose comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0') to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the cast into numbers.", "datePublished": "2018-04-25T05:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T07:39:07", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://k3research.outerhaven.de/posts/small-mistakes-lead-to-big-problems.html", "https://github.com/phpLiteAdmin/pla/issues/11"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-10362"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "18e1ed60-303c-3b0e-a34b-104830f96539", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8904cc83-fb40-3160-9746-d821f22a7e9b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
