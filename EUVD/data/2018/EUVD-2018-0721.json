The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier and 2.0.0.M1 through 2.0.0.M7 is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the \"run_user\" to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system. In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the \"run_user\" requires shell access to the server. Spring Boot application that are not installed as a service, or are not using the embedded launch script are not susceptible.", "datePublished": "2018-03-19T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:27:35", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1196", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xx65-cc7g-9pfp", "https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1196"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-1196", "GHSA-xx65-cc7g-9pfp"], "assigner": "dell", "epss": 0.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b0889ea-8ac8-30ac-9bd1-00e4b4021b37", "product": {"name": "Spring Boot"}, "product_version": "2.0.0.M1 - 2.0.0.M7"}, {"id": "86db31b1-bf21-3d07-b14c-32341d188ed2", "product": {"name": "Spring Boot"}, "product_version": "1.5.0 - 1.5.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3cd78c02-6bed-36b5-ba58-c936d1a7272e", "vendor": {"name": "Dell EMC"}}], "isExploited": false}
