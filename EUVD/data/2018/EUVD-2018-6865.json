{"id": "EUVD-2018-6865", "enisaUuid": "b2d96d95-11bb-3809-ad6f-b8ae8e3a261d", "description": "The Sony Xperia L1 Android device with a build fingerprint of Sony/G3313/G3313:7.0/43.0.A.6.49/2867558199:user/release-keys contains the android framework (i.e., system_server) with a package name of android (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) that has been modified by Sony or another entity in the supply chain. The system_server process in the core android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage. The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND_STATUS_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device.", "datePublished": "2019-04-25T19:29:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T09:46:25", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "https://www.kryptowire.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-14983"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8e290eb1-e50c-3ce4-81d7-46a7d5c52aff", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "48c1307f-56c0-3354-8584-9bd95e90f6ef", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
