The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-15T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:48:32", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-ise-multi-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106513"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15463"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c5ef398b-70db-3cf6-8d8f-63fed8b35106", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa9beb04-650d-3441-950d-66bae44a34ce", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
