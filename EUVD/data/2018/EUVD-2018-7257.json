This file could allow the attacker to execute commands at the privilege level of the user prime. This user does not have administrative or root privileges. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect permission setting for important system directories. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file by using TFTP, which can be accessed via the web-interface GUI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run commands on the targeted application without authentication.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:34:54", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-15379", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45555/", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-pi-tftp", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105506", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041816"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15379"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 89.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d49be77e-7d88-33b1-ba94-2a3e3e6764f2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8cece854-8b61-3abd-b5d1-e22376807a77", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
