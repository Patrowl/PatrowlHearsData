The Moxa AWK 3121 provides certfile upload functionality so that an administrator can upload a certificate file used for connecting to the wireless network. However, the same functionality allows an attacker to execute commands on the device. The POST parameter \"iw_privatePass\" is susceptible to this injection. By crafting a packet that contains shell metacharacters, it is possible for an attacker to execute the attack.", "datePublished": "2019-06-07T19:36:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T07:46:46", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/samuelhuntley/Moxa_AWK_1121/blob/master/Moxa_AWK_1121", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153223/Moxa-AWK-3121-1.14-Information-Disclosure-Command-Execution.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-10699"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8f18e087-7fa5-3c0f-a10d-4862d7a68997", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "770a52c7-3232-392f-bf1f-73c85c7802ae", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
