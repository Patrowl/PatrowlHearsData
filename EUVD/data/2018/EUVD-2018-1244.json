The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of incoming TCP SYN packets to specific listening ports. The improper handling of the TCP SYN packets could cause a system file description to be allocated and not freed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of TCP SYN packets to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to eventually restart if a file description cannot be obtained.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:45:57", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-cpar-dos", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041684", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105282"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0421"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "409df9a0-ccbd-3d36-8d6d-34bb94607f7f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Access Registrar"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eeecf100-d0ac-30fb-85ad-753ca3367501", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
