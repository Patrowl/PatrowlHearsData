These IVR systems rely on various frequencies of audio signals; based on the frequency, certain commands and functions are processed. Since these frequencies are accepted within a phone call, an attacker can record these frequencies and use them for service activations. This is a request-forgery issue when the required series of DTMF signals for a service activation is predictable (e.g., the IVR system does not speak a nonce to the caller). In this case, the IVR system accepts an activation request from a less-secure channel (any loudspeaker in the caller's physical environment) without verifying that the request was intended (it matches a nonce sent over a more-secure channel to the caller's earpiece).", "datePublished": "2018-05-30T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T08:10:14", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664440759091207", "https://datarift.blogspot.com/2018/05/CVE-2018-11518-abusing-ivr-systems.html", "http://virgil-cj.blogspot.com/2018/05/0day-legacy-ivr-lets-phreak.html", "https://twitter.com/mishradhiraj_/status/1001664204485652482"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-11518"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "169a7f90-7d4d-38a5-926a-d1816e562c76", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "706556af-5e01-31cd-8522-7bbff7cbe13f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
