The vulnerability is due to a missing check in the SSH server. An attacker could use this vulnerability to open an SSH connection to an affected Cisco IOS or IOS XE device with a source address belonging to a VRF instance. Once connected, the attacker would still need to provide valid credentials to access the device.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:18:45", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-ios-ssh-vrf", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106560"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0484"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "06b74a3d-7324-36c6-93fd-ec40667fdfdd", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b59bd49-6302-3101-98a6-627c26bc312d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
