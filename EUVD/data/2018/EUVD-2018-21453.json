An off-by-one error when processing malformed TLS-CBC ciphertext could cause the receiving side to include in the HMAC computation exactly 64K bytes of data following the record buffer, aka an over-read. The MAC comparison will subsequently fail and the connection will be closed. This could be used for denial of service.
