The vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for HTML inline frames (iframes) by the web UI of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected UI to navigate to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct click-jacking or other client-side browser attacks on the affected system.
