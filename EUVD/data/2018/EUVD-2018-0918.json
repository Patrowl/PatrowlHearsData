The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate limiting protection for IPv6 ingress traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the affected device a high rate of IPv6 packets. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to CPU and resource constraints.
