The vulnerability is due to a corruption of certain timer mechanisms triggered by specific roaming events. This corruption will eventually cause a timer crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious reassociation events multiple times to the same AP in a short period of time, causing a DoS condition on the affected AP.", "datePublished": "2018-10-17T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:24:13", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105680", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041918", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-ap-ft-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0441"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e5cb8c62-4217-3282-8741-1badb4f8900b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "997a9176-068d-3d85-92b7-9d1d81e51ec8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
