New installations created from the compromised installer since at least May 2018 were subject to installation of Linux/ChachaDDoS, a multi-stage DDoS bot that uses Lua for second- and third-stage components. The compromise leaked administrative credentials (base64-encoded admin password and server domain) to an external URL during installation and/or resulted in the installer dropping and executing a DDoS malware payload under local system privileges. Compromised servers were subsequently observed participating in large-scale DDoS activity. Vesta acknowledged exploitation in the wild in October 2018.", "datePublished": "2025-10-15T01:23:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T14:27:57", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/10/18/new-linux-chachaddos-malware-distributed-servers-vestacp-installed/", "https://github.com/outroll/vesta/commit/ee03eff016e03cb76fac7ae3a0f9d1ef0f8ee35b#diff-df8da0c91e9086454c60cd468849630dL1270", "https://github.com/outroll/vesta/commit/a3f0fa1501d424477786e3e7150bb05c0b99518f#diff-df8da0c91e9086454c60cd468849630dR1256", "https://forum.vestacp.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=17641&p=73282", "https://forum.vestacp.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=17641&start=180#p73907", "https://vestacp.com/", "https://github.com/outroll/vesta", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/vestacp-debian-installer-malicious-backdoor-supply-chain-compromise", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25117"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-25117"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f33a5892-bfc9-36a0-8dc9-f71a8921b8f6", "product": {"name": "Control Panel (CP)"}, "product_version": "commit a3f0fa1 (2018-05-31) <commit ee03eff (2018-06-13)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80df64c6-7a5f-306f-99f6-9dcedcae0d1a", "vendor": {"name": "Vesta"}}], "isExploited": false}
