The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:26:44", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-uipp-7900-xss", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041791"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15434"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3201e482-308a-3dd9-a285-d185c09a26de", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified IP Phone 7900 Series"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71bb1549-745c-3af1-ad29-f17d4608009e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
