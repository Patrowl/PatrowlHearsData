The vulnerability is due to improper boundary restrictions on user-supplied input in the Guest user feature of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted device, triggering a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service condition, or could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:45:30", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-rv-routers-overflow", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105285", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041675"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0423"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 3.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "247becbd-c1d9-3600-b658-ded6e62c6879", "product": {"name": "Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b0ed66f-8934-361b-87bd-ebab7e8b2d38", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
