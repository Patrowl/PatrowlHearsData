A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of executable file formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types (/usr/share/applications). The control sequence defers unknown file types to the handle_unknown_media() function, which executes xdg-open against the filename specified in the sequence. The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control sequence through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When the control sequence is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file will be run.", "datePublished": "2018-12-17T05:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T11:51:19", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-20167.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2018-20167.html", "https://www.enlightenment.org/news/2018-12-16-terminology-1.3.1", "https://phab.enlightenment.org/T7504", "https://phab.enlightenment.org/rTRM1ac204da9148e7bccb1b5f34b523e2094dfc39e2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-20167"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b1fdc6c4-15c9-3669-bfe0-bc152d8c131f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a0bbde8f-773c-38c4-b6b3-5bab46bcd04d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
