The vulnerability exists because the affected management interface performs insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:39:19", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-300-switch-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0465"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0bb0022f-f062-36f5-86f7-a1717c5ba317", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b15b38e5-ec46-3847-82da-e6218b296325", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
