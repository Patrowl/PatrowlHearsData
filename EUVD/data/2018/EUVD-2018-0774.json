This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.", "datePublished": "2017-07-12T13:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:12:27", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-7678", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r34r-f84j-5x4x", "http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/CVE-2017-7678-Apache-Spark-XSS-web-UI-MHTML-vulnerability-td21947.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99603"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-7678", "GHSA-r34r-f84j-5x4x"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 1.79, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2372b85a-5d18-3ea3-83c9-63bafbe9fd59", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d6385ac-8c76-3d8e-8286-5154b20de79d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
