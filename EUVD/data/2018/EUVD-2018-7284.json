The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:31:47", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-ucsd-xss", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041783"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15406"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f20f91b3-56a1-3484-b240-1c621f26d11f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec3d8f65-2d9d-3207-8f2d-a8b9d0953644", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
