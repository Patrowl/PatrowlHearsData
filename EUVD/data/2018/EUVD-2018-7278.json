The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:32:35", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105560", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-csp-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15400"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1860afdf-3709-373d-bfa5-41b7a9b9db21", "product": {"name": "Cisco Cloud Services Platform 2100"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6acfa4b0-1a87-3716-bc57-fccdd84e3dcf", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
