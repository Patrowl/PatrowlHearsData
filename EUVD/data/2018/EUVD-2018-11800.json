Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be easily bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the handling of Export requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to arbitrarily overwrite files resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
