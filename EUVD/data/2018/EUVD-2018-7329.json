The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-11-08T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:21:03", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105857", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-psc-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15451"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "70db64b6-f0ff-3118-80c2-66e81ede29f7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Service Catalog"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83538d48-b826-3c02-af28-e74ccee7b77c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
