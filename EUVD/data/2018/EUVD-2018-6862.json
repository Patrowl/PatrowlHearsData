The system_server process in the core android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage (i.e., sdcard). The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND_STATUS_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device.", "datePublished": "2019-04-25T19:27:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T09:46:24", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/", "https://www.kryptowire.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-14980"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d0914116-ace8-353e-8464-e6decbf7ab12", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f28e5d7-c5f2-3b01-970c-6628ae031565", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
