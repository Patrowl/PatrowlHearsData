The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the Cisco WebEx clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing meeting attendees with a malicious Flash (.swf) file via the file-sharing capabilities of the client. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user. This affects the clients installed by customers when accessing a WebEx meeting. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30, WBS31, and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are impacted: Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.23.2, Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.10, Cisco WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.10, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server builds prior to 2.8 MR2.
