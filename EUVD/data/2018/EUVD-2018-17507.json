The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the \"allow-recursion\" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if \"recursion no;\" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" settings IF \"recursion yes;\" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of \"allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};\" if \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when \"recursion yes;\" is in effect and no match list values are provided for \"allow-query-cache\" or \"allow-query\" for the setting of \"allow-recursion\" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the \"allow-query\" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.", "datePublished": "2019-01-16T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:20:36", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-5738.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-5738", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2018-5738", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3683-1/", "https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01616", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041115", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-13", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190830-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5738"], "assigner": "isc", "epss": 2.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8d11a05a-9bc1-3d54-880c-0793bcdb1040", "product": {"name": "BIND 9"}, "product_version": "9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0->9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition."}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c1dc5450-1731-3739-989b-732d0f24296b", "vendor": {"name": "ISC"}}], "isExploited": false}
