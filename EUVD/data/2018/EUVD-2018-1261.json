To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate with valid local user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper implementation of file system permissions, which could allow non-administrative users to place files within restricted directories. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing an executable file within the restricted directory, which when executed by the ERC client, would run with Administrator privileges.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:43:08", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-0438", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-umbrella-file-read", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105286", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45339/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0438"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 4.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee81c9a4-c9be-3aa2-b96c-a6856799e609", "product": {"name": "Cisco Umbrella"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d0bb57ee-27db-3889-8dbc-f0f7d579e275", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
