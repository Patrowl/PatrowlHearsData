The vulnerability is due to the installation of the PostgreSQL database with unchanged default access credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the machine where CEMS is installed and establishing a local connection to the database. The fix for this vulnerability randomizes the database access password in new installations; however, the fix will not change the password for existing installations. Users are required to manually change the password, as documented in the Workarounds section of this advisory. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2018-12-04T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:20:34", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181204-ems-sql-passwrd", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106124", "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-42"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0468"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5c9485d6-8ab1-3be2-9364-b28dec8d5296", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d189bd6-6fed-30b0-aabb-db88efcafab8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
