The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:40:12", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105293", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041685", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-pca-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0458"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17628f27-b61e-3f58-becf-79832fe3dfe6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c620a771-f509-30e6-bcfe-69b1bacb2f85", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
