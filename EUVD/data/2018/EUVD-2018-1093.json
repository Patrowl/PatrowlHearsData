{"id": "EUVD-2018-1093", "enisaUuid": "152042a8-2dd6-3d26-a286-d8a8eb484975", "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and alter the data of existing users and groups on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could create a new, privileged account to obtain full control over the device interface. This vulnerability affects Connected Grid Network Management System, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 3.0; and IoT Field Network Director, if running a software release prior to IoT-FND Release 4.1.1-6 or 4.2.0-123.
