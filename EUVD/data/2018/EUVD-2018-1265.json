The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the code that handles CAPWAP keepalive requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP keepalive packet to a vulnerable Cisco WLC device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the contents of device memory, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-17T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:24:00", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041923", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105664", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-capwap-memory-leak"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0442"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aeffd364-5686-3c5f-864b-1f76a51bef65", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4bfd6e76-238b-36ca-95df-07b2d70d0fdf", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
