The vulnerability exists because the software running on an affected device insufficiently validates user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link provided to the user or through the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the user interface or access sensitive system-based information, which under normal circumstances should be prohibited.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:19:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-0461", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106515", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-phone-script-injection"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0461"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d68bdeab-6374-3eb3-82df-f2f4d4944dec", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a637589f-b23e-384c-9ba3-2097ada018ab", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
