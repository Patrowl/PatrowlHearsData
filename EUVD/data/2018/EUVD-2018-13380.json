It potentially causes an outage of third-party services that were not designed to recover from exceptions. On the client, ID token handling can cause an unhandled exception because of misinterpretation of an integer as a string, resulting in denial-of-service and then other users can no longer login/sign-in to the affected third-party service. Once this third-party service uses Google Sign-In with google-api-cpp-client, a malicious user can trigger this client/auth/oauth2_authorization.cc vulnerability by requesting the client to receive the ID token from a Google authentication server.", "datePublished": "2019-05-30T15:58:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T12:12:28", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/pull/58", "https://github.com/google/google-api-cpp-client/issues/57"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-20840"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "608ab9f5-10d0-3384-88b8-f07fdf10a1a9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b55cb128-3bf6-333c-afee-e8d9c58dd025", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
