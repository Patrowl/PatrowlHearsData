The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify and delete arbitrary data in the PLM database or gain shell access with the privileges of the postgres user.", "datePublished": "2018-11-28T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:20:42", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106039", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181128-plm-sql-inject"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15441"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "64689e0e-e5ba-3b42-b889-adbd1ca9658d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime License Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ef89f7e-5b2e-3c45-8fca-7f657bb97841", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
