This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.", "datePublished": "2018-08-10T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T09:21:40", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44710", "https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/pull/52", "https://rastating.github.io/unrestricted-file-upload-via-plugin-uploader-in-wordpress/", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105060"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-14028"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6cdfbf25-91f3-3dc2-aba2-30f0124fbb51", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0e79f204-b005-31dd-a697-0d69d8f7b98d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
