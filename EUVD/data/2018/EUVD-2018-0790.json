{"id": "EUVD-2018-0790", "enisaUuid": "9134de64-13a2-3d43-ac8b-f4a8a6558b5a", "description": "The Apache Qpid Proton-J transport includes an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS, enabled by use of the 'transport.ssl(...)' methods. Unless a verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate, with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed. The latter hostname verifying mode was not implemented in Apache Qpid Proton-J versions 0.3 to 0.29.0, with attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack. Uses of the Proton-J protocol engine which do not utilise the optional transport TLS wrapper are not impacted, e.g. usage within Qpid JMS. Uses of Proton-J utilising the optional transport TLS wrapper layer that wish to enable hostname verification must be upgraded to version 0.30.0 or later and utilise the VerifyMode#VERIFY_PEER_NAME configuration, which is now the default for client mode usage unless configured otherwise.", "datePublished": "2018-11-13T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:39:59", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17187", "https://github.com/apache/qpid-proton-j/commit/0cb8ca03cec42120dcfc434561592d89a89a805e", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xvch-r4wf-h8w9", "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1962", "https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/qpid-users/201811.mbox/%3CCAFitrpQSV73Vz7rJYfLJK7gvEymZSCR5ooWUeU8j4jzRydk-eg%40mail.gmail.com%3E", "https://qpid.apache.org/cves/CVE-2018-17187.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105935"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-17187", "GHSA-xvch-r4wf-h8w9"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "decc6c49-2b2e-3514-8da9-e05b223e17fc", "product": {"name": "Apache Qpid Proton-J"}, "product_version": "Apache Qpid Proton-J 0.3 to 0.29.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4efad283-24d2-3df5-8249-c123ad621f92", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
