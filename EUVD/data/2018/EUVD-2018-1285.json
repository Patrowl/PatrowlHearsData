The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-provided input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with a highly privileged user account and performing a sequence of specific user management operations that interfere with the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to permanently degrade the functionality of the affected system.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:39:39", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-nfvis-dos1", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105291"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0462"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "817d94fd-d210-318f-ba7c-ea3172f2fd9d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9fe2007a-aed6-376d-a437-c0295673aa68", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
