An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x80002000 by the IRPFile.sys Antiy-AVL ATool kernel driver. The bug is caused by failure to properly validate the length of the user-supplied data, which results in a kernel stack buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, which could lead to privilege escalation and a failed exploit could lead to denial of service.", "datePublished": "2018-12-05T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T11:44:19", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/150549/ATool-1.0.0.22-Stack-Buffer-Overflow.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-19650"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c0143b0a-e3b4-3cb5-8c8b-b451899e86c1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "37ebb56b-21c0-3cb8-9b08-3633167a9ab5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
