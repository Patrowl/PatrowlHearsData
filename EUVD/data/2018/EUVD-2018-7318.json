The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and displayed in certain web pages of the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link or view an affected log file. The injected script code may be executed in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-15T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:48:40", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-15440", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-ise-multi-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106513"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15440"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3c54e1b-ba49-3e16-851b-da2d995e2a7f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ed5a688-2ee3-315e-a312-fe9286c77158", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
