The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:49:29", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-pnc-stored-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106514"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0482"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6989c261-97c7-3a8d-95e3-6f9114dbdd36", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Network Control System"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c69d7da-0801-3f3b-979c-da6e9de4d169", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
