In some cases, this lead to vulnerabilities where CouchDB admin users could access the underlying operating system as the CouchDB user. Together with other vulnerabilities, it allowed full system entry for unauthenticated users. Rather than waiting for new vulnerabilities to be discovered, and fixing them as they come up, the CouchDB development team decided to make changes to avoid this entire class of vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2019-01-02T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:39:59", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-17188.html", "https://blog.couchdb.org/2018/12/17/cve-2018-17188/", "https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbmu03935en_us", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X3JOUCX7LHDV4YWZDQNXT5NTKKRANZQW/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/S5FPHVVU5KMRFKQTJPAM3TBGC7LKCWQS/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-17188"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 2.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b72def2e-b831-3ce2-8df7-4a6a3dc8a7a4", "product": {"name": "Apache CouchDB"}, "product_version": "All"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "09479d77-460f-3603-9c64-7b357253ab93", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
