The vulnerability is due to errors that could occur when the affected software constructs and applies per-user-override rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a network through an affected device that has a vulnerable configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that are behind the affected device and would typically be protected by the interface ACL.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:32:55", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-asa-acl-bypass", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041788", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105517"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15398"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8c8c232-24e0-3015-8fe1-1fbb5b6100c8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a7bbce9-749e-3667-9fc9-fa3035c727e6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
