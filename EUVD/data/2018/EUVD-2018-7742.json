This makes it easier for adversaries to detect the covert operation. Specifically, the product uses a compression technique to prevent the identification of certain libraries in the software by obfuscation. The software relies on a TLS callback and an additional executable file to enable these libraries and their access to certain websites. The unpacked software can be exploited by several different types of documented techniques.", "datePublished": "2018-08-26T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:10:05", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/GitHubAssessments/CVE_Assessment_02_2018/blob/master/FindMe_Report.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15885"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "54702547-5e1c-366a-bb52-b786f0412d4d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b06faad2-81db-3a80-ac90-69a921f57d83", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
