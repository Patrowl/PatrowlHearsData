On a DELETE request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length value other than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. Mitigation: The fix to check DELETE requests and overwrite non-zero Content-Length header values was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.", "datePublished": "2018-12-19T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:39:59", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17194", "https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/1baead6f525046a613fc4fe494a0d193776ea70f", "https://github.com/apache/nifi/commit/748cf745628dab20b7e71f12b5dcfe6ed0bbf134", "https://github.com/apache/nifi", "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5628", "https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2018-17194"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-17194", "GHSA-43fp-vwwg-qgv6"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 1.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a8d401d-863a-34d4-837b-a6abd3f33198", "product": {"name": "Apache NiFi"}, "product_version": "Apache NiFi 1.0.0 - 1.7.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa712816-549c-3016-ad18-55e3223604b7", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
