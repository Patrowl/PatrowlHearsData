{"id": "EUVD-2018-7306", "enisaUuid": "10158e81-62f7-3bbb-955f-168e5b25d2f8", "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain BGP update messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages that include a specific, malformed attribute to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:27:41", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-iosxr-dos", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041790"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15428"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "073eaa58-e856-3872-ab67-fd1444c328a4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "653258eb-374e-37e3-aab4-ab5b0bcf041e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
