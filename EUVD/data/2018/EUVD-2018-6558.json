This is an issue when dnsdist is deployed as a DNS Firewall and used to filter some records that should not be received by the backend. This issue occurs only when either the 'useClientSubnet' or the experimental 'addXPF' parameters are used when declaring a new backend.", "datePublished": "2018-11-26T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T09:38:12", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-14663.html", "https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2018-08.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-14663"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-14663"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "310bbe7a-827d-3164-9caa-122d0214a2bc", "product": {"name": "dnsdist"}, "product_version": "1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "df090c9c-94ee-3392-a6cc-9603d0daf41c", "vendor": {"name": "[UNKNOWN]"}}], "isExploited": false}
