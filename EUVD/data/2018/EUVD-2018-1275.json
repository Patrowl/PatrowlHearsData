The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:41:06", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105278", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-tetration-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0452"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02b3c08e-5a25-35ed-b652-79305fffbc48", "product": {"name": "Cisco Tetration Analytics"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ad01c07b-c2a7-3fdd-ab10-d5f68a628415", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
