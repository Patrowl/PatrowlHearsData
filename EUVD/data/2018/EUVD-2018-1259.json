The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs insufficient checks for associations between user accounts and organization accounts. An attacker who has administrator or compliance officer privileges for one organization account could exploit this vulnerability by using those privileges to view and modify data for another organization account. No customer data was impacted by this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:43:27", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105301", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180905-webex-id-mod"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0436"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ea959f9-c76c-3961-8a6c-7767dcec4754", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Teams"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "59711e3f-482c-32bb-a674-9b0eba43bc92", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
