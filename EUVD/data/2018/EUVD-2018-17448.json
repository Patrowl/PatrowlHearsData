User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of specially crafted pdf files with embedded u3d images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-5677 and CVE-2018-5680.", "datePublished": "2018-05-24T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T05:40:51", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php", "https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2018-0015/", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104300"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5679"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "41c9dcaf-1d0e-30b1-b30f-3718cee22011", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be2e323e-f71c-3f55-acd9-338cb0fcb7d1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
