The portal component is delivered with an insecure default User Profile community configuration that allows anonymous users to retrieve the account names of all portal users via /portal/server.pt/user/user/ requests. When WCI is synchronised with Active Directory (AD), this vulnerability can expose the account names of all AD users. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.", "datePublished": "2018-09-18T02:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:39:58", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Sep/22", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105350"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-16959"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5c5c21d2-39fc-3e3c-8208-413686604467", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5dcac250-c364-36b8-8c1a-7c575ec0642a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
