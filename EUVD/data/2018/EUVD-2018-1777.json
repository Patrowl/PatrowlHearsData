It was reported (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.", "datePublished": "2018-01-24T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T12:33:49", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1000005.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4098", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1543", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-1000005", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2018-1000005.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2018-1000005", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2018-1000005.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040273", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3554-1/", "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_2018-824a.html", "https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-1000005"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6a3d9142-03ef-36ca-a1d0-1fec57ff5878", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11ad6598-c03b-3a89-b0e7-71dd68bcb11f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
