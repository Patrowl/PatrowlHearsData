Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.", "datePublished": "2018-08-22T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T00:21:49", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.SYMSA1459.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105100"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5238"], "assigner": "symantec", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cb930502-24d8-3458-8295-f62e1fdaa663", "product": {"name": "Norton Power Eraser"}, "product_version": "Prior to 5.3.0.24"}, {"id": "dab3c14e-d5c1-30c7-a6cb-5b80e4a0bff6", "product": {"name": "SymDiag"}, "product_version": "Prior to 2.1.242"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd9d7eca-f620-31b0-b6f0-e41cb338d4dd", "vendor": {"name": "Symantec Corporation"}}], "isExploited": false}
