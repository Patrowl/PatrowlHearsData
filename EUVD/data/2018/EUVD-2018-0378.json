In a ZIP bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response that becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take special care when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack. To exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes a request to.", "datePublished": "2018-06-07T02:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:04:07", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16129", "https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/issues/1259", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8225-6cvr-8pqp", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/479", "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/479"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16129", "GHSA-8225-6cvr-8pqp"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69625ae0-6acc-3720-9a53-fd688840a090", "product": {"name": "superagent node module"}, "product_version": "<3.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e81b2989-bb02-3220-89db-9ac59ac0b802", "vendor": {"name": "HackerOne"}}], "isExploited": false}
