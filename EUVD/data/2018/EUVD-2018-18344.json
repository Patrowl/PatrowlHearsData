They have made modifications that allow a user with physical access to the device to obtain a root shell via ADB. Modifying the read-only properties by an app as the system user creates a UNIX domain socket named factory_test that will execute commands as the root user by processes that have privilege to access it (as per the SELinux rules that the vendor controls).", "datePublished": "2018-08-29T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T06:10:10", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-6597"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8fbe1649-59b0-3ff4-afc9-9ceb3ff5576b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9a303494-c2fc-35da-840c-b34851d763d2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
