A remote attacker sending a DNS query for a meta-type like OPT can lead to a zone being wrongly cached as failing DNSSEC validation. It only arises if the parent zone is signed, and all the authoritative servers for that parent zone answer with FORMERR to a query for at least one of the meta-types. As a result, subsequent queries from clients requesting DNSSEC validation will be answered with a ServFail.", "datePublished": "2018-11-09T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T09:38:12", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-14644.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2018-14644.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2018-14644", "https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-07.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-14644"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-14644"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2505e8e8-0ebb-33d4-a6c3-17ce1ded0939", "product": {"name": "pdns"}, "product_version": "4.1.5"}, {"id": "55cdfb9e-3f68-3c0c-828d-2bcc360c700d", "product": {"name": "pdns"}, "product_version": "4.0.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dafdf703-77fa-3d2a-9384-abd67f4f82f8", "vendor": {"name": "[UNKNOWN]"}}], "isExploited": false}
