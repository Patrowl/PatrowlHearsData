The vulnerability is due to the system not strictly filtering the file upload type. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to upload a script Trojan to admin.php/admin/configset/index/group/upload.html to gain server control by composing a request for a .txt upload and then changing it to a .php upload. The attacker must have admin access to change the upload_file_ext (aka \"Allow upload file suffix\") setting, and must use \"php,php\" in this setting to bypass the \"php\" restriction.", "datePublished": "2018-08-03T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T03:54:20", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/yxcmf/ukcms/issues/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-14911"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a7c93f3-1679-3569-b919-1be7a1cbdebc", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "538342dd-9087-3d53-85ba-f497aa45bcbe", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
