The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2018-10-17T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:23:38", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105663", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-sm-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15435"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "75424bca-1fab-3141-8563-7471897cabe6", "product": {"name": "Cisco SocialMiner"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d9b34932-fd42-3eb1-8e6c-63444eb4e7a9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
