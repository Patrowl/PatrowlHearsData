The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-11T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:48:47", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106508", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-tms-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15467"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6172ea8d-457f-3dc7-8534-f7871981df2b", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4fd514fe-9b54-3ec4-910a-62c0e10e2aaf", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
