The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly clear previously assigned session identifiers for a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an existing session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based interface. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session on the system. Versions 8.1 and 8.5 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-17T21:35:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:11:56", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlan-hijack", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108005"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0382"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0016906d-d6d8-394d-b3ac-9c405c40b0e2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.5(144.5)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "342a9cc8-604b-35ea-a454-be585ac20f6a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
