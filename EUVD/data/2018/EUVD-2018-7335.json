The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:49:04", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-cpi-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106509"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15457"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e4c875b5-d2bb-3024-8102-47557870387b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96e39a09-fd25-32cd-bff6-0bca9c7d524f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
