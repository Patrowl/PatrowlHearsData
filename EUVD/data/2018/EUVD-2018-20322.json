The vulnerability is due to the lack of args/input validation on render_html before allowing it to be called by extract(), a PHP built-in function. Because of this, the supplied args/input can be used to overwrite the $pagepath variable, which then could lead to a local file inclusion attack.", "datePublished": "2018-03-14T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T02:06:59", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-products-filter/#developers", "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/arbitrary-shortcode-execution-local-file-inclusion-in-woof-pluginus-net/index.html", "https://www.woocommerce-filter.com/update-woocommerce-products-filter-v-2-2-0/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-8711"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "014f8e5a-b515-3b65-b129-0192e2e210a6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cfc6d5de-c621-3711-ace4-eaf6568d4045", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
