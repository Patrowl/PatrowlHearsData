The vulnerability is due to insufficient ingress TCP rate limiting for TCP ports 22 (SSH) and 443 (HTTPS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, steady stream of TCP traffic to port 22 or 443 on the data interfaces that are configured with management access to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T14:45:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:10:03", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-firepower-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108178"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15462"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9af4492-129a-3372-9889-060f3adb1ce3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.2.3.12"}, {"id": "f7df197d-58b3-30e9-af31-b7d727051b2b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.3.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11d432fd-6259-3bfd-a997-ea11d1e7cb3c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
