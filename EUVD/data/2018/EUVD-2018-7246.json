The vulnerability is due to the affected software improperly sanitizing command arguments to prevent modifications to the underlying Linux filesystem on a device. An attacker who has privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15) access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability on the device by executing CLI commands that contain crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the underlying Linux shell of the affected device and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:36:33", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-privesc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15368"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9805e8f3-2d15-360d-8555-def155282a5d", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b0b1f3ff-ec5e-3fc8-84ae-c558c5b3e908", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
