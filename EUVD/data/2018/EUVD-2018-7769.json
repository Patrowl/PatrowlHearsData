One type of page in Cloudera Manager uses a 'returnUrl' parameter to redirect the user to another page in Cloudera Manager once a wizard is completed. The validity of this parameter was not checked. As a result, the user could be automatically redirected to an attacker's external site or perform a malicious JavaScript function that results in cross-site scripting (XSS). This was fixed by not allowing any value in the returnUrl parameter with patterns such as http://, https://, //, or javascript. The only exceptions to this rule are the SAML Login/Logout URLs, which remain supported since they are explicitly configured and they are not passed via the returnUrl parameter.", "datePublished": "2019-06-20T18:04:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:10:05", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html#cloudera_manager", "https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/other/security-bulletins/topics/Security-Bulletin.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15913"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d3337930-64e4-31fd-8da2-9487417844cb", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "293fe5f8-f3ca-3b14-824b-059120725e12", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
