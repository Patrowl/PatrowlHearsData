Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application.", "datePublished": "2018-08-22T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T20:31:27", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105099", "https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.SYMSA1459.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5235"], "assigner": "symantec", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d17cb00f-bd3b-3d86-abf0-404ece6f1efb", "product": {"name": "Norton Utilities"}, "product_version": "Prior to 16.0.3.44"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "46992ad1-8ea6-3ca6-b3ae-14680a328eac", "vendor": {"name": "Symantec Corporation"}}], "isExploited": false}
