After successful authentication, the device sends an authentication cookie to the end user such that they can access the devices web administration panel. This token is hard-coded to a string in the source code (/usr/share/www/check.lp file). By setting this cookie in a browser, an attacker is able to maintain access to every ENC-400 device without knowing the password, which results in authentication bypass. Even if a user changes the password on the device, this token is static and unchanged.", "datePublished": "2019-03-17T20:47:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T11:58:18", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-20219", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151802/Teracue-ENC-400-Command-Injection-Missing-Authentication.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Feb/48", "https://zxsecurity.co.nz/research.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-20219"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 44.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "faaf51c0-d506-3664-826d-69a577cd5e83", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e54c7bb-81d5-342e-bf3a-9d33d8df5c1a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
