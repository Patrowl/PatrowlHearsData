The code in question was replaced in Node.js 6.x and later so this vulnerability only impacts all versions of Node.js 4.x. The regular expression, `splitPathRe`, used within the `'path'` module for the various path parsing functions, including `path.dirname()`, `path.extname()` and `path.parse()` was structured in such a way as to allow an attacker to craft a string, that when passed through one of these functions, could take a significant amount of time to evaluate, potentially leading to a full denial of service.", "datePublished": "2018-05-17T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T16:48:51", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-7158.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2018-7158.html", "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-7158"], "assigner": "nodejs", "epss": 1.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "252dfb4b-997e-36a7-bc16-68660ea378a9", "product": {"name": "Node.js"}, "product_version": "4.x"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71561033-3138-3c0b-b396-54e84836709d", "vendor": {"name": "The Node.js Project"}}], "isExploited": false}
