The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to and passing traffic through a Layer 3 interface of an affected device, if the interface is configured for MACsec MKA using EAP-TLS and is running in access-session closed mode. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass 802.1x network access controls and gain access to the network.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:35:55", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-macsec", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105416"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15372"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a6902948-aec8-352e-99d2-3ef05ebcff88", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac003873-325e-39a1-beee-59d1fed674a8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
