The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of SIP Session Description Protocol (SDP) parameters by the SDP parser of an affected phone. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SIP packet to an affected phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all active phone calls on the affected phone to be dropped while the SIP process on the phone unexpectedly restarts, resulting in a DoS condition.
