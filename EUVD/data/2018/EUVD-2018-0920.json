The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly enforce RBAC for virtual domains. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an authenticated, crafted HTTP request to a targeted application. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass RBAC policies on the targeted system to modify a virtual domain and access resources that are not normally accessible.
