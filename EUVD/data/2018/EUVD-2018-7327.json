The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web-based management interface to become unreachable, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2018-11-08T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:21:20", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105863", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-vsms-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15449"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "96b4f7e6-0711-3f19-a98d-a9c1f42b9e1b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Video Surveillance Media Server Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7294aeec-beda-3cc7-a622-265e74c0eb0f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
