The vulnerability exist because the affected software improperly sanitizes command arguments, failing to prevent access to certain internal data structures on an affected device. An attacker who has privileged EXEC mode (privilege level 15) access to an affected device could exploit these vulnerabilities on the device by executing CLI commands that contain custom arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:37:15", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-iosxe-cmdinj", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0477"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17dc36f0-4ed0-35e4-89c5-63d916b5cf68", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f88be1d4-265c-30b1-8be2-6293ef319177", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
