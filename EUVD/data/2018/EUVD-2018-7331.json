{"id": "EUVD-2018-7331", "enisaUuid": "a92efdfb-7a87-3e2c-8a4d-5b9eb77c04e1", "description": "A vulnerability in the Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Decryption and Verification or S/MIME Public Key Harvesting features of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to corrupt system memory. A successful exploit could cause the filtering process to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of S/MIME-signed emails. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious S/MIME-signed email through a targeted device. If Decryption and Verification or Public Key Harvesting is configured, the filtering process could crash due to memory corruption and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. The software could then resume processing the same S/MIME-signed email, causing the filtering process to crash and restart again. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to recover the ESA.", "datePublished": "2019-01-10T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:18:36", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190109-esa-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106511"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15453"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42f5228f-5eb3-3c80-a00c-226a7081af71", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cb29fcac-b169-3bd7-9a0b-b8306157fd99", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
