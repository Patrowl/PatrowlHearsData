The vulnerability is due to an authorization check that does not properly include the access level of the web interface user. An attacker who has valid application credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information that belongs to other users. The attacker could then use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.", "datePublished": "2018-10-05T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-26T14:31:57", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041779", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181003-imcs-ucsd-id"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-15405"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6786509b-a621-370d-86dc-e424f58857eb", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d08c4967-b5a9-389b-8fc1-438163a1c4e9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
