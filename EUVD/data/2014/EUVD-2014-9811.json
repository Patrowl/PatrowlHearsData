Authentication can be bypassed entirely by supplying a specially crafted cookie (access=3), granting access to the upload functionality without valid credentials. If file uploads are enabled on the server, the attacker can upload a web shell and gain remote code execution with the privileges of the web server user, potentially leading to full system compromise.", "datePublished": "2025-07-31T15:01:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-31T15:27:11", "baseScore": 9.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/simple_e_document_upload_exec.rb", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31264", "https://sourceforge.net/projects/simplee-doc/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/simple-edocument-abitrary-file-upload-rce"], "aliases": ["CVE-2014-125126"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 66.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "18a4ba6d-8a62-3253-ac99-a7021b512dda", "product": {"name": "Simple E-Document"}, "product_version": "3.0 \u22643.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ac42d8c-73bd-3426-b0a3-436af427adc6", "vendor": {"name": "Simple E-Document"}}], "isExploited": false}
