The issue arises due to inconsistencies between the Central Directory and Local File Header entries in ZIP files. When viewed in WinRAR, the file name from the Central Directory is displayed to the user, while the file from the Local File Header is extracted and executed. An attacker can leverage this flaw to spoof filenames and trick users into executing malicious payloads under the guise of harmless files, potentially leading to remote code execution.", "datePublished": "2025-07-25T15:59:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T01:38:41", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.rarlab.com/vuln_zip_spoofing_4.20.html", "https://an7isec.blogspot.com/2014/03/winrar-file-extension-spoofing-0day.html", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/winrar_name_spoofing.rb", "https://web.archive.org/web/20141111142204/https://www.intelcrawler.com/report_2603.pdf", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140625054244/http://intelcrawler.com/news-15", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/winrar-filename-spoofing-rce"], "aliases": ["CVE-2014-125119"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 13.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a446eb9d-8391-3641-a55a-fb1ff56b8316", "product": {"name": "WinRAR"}, "product_version": "4.11 <5.00"}, {"id": "dd42f8dc-4697-3730-ae92-9326cb20ce20", "product": {"name": "WinRAR"}, "product_version": "3.80 <3.91"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "59985b19-8599-3836-97dc-4b7985a1a869", "vendor": {"name": "RARLAB"}}], "isExploited": false}
