The device provides a user with the capability of blocking IP addresses using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site scripting forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface into executing a cross-site scripting payload on the user's browser and execute any action on the device provided by the web management interface.", "datePublished": "2019-06-18T20:18:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:34:22", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-8334", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153227/Securifi-Almond-2015-Buffer-Overflow-Command-Injection-XSS-CSRF.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Securifi_Almond_plus_sec_issues.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8334"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a24e25da-1b5c-3eeb-ae12-1272a2d00793", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "24d77f90-c689-3eca-ae4a-abf35c426fb0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
