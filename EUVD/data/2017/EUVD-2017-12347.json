Devices that make use of Das U-Boot's AES-CBC encryption feature using environment encryption (i.e., setting the configuration parameter CONFIG_ENV_AES=y) read environment variables from disk as the encrypted disk image is processed. An attacker with physical access to the device can manipulate the encrypted environment data to include a crafted two-byte sequence which triggers an error in environment variable parsing. This error condition is improperly handled by Das U-Boot, resulting in an immediate process termination with a debugging message.", "datePublished": "2018-07-24T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T14:16:28", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-3226.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100675", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/166743"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3226"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "915d107e-5c94-3e07-aee7-8dd9a298157e", "product": {"name": "U-Boot"}, "product_version": "2017.09 <2017.09"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b83c85e0-39ce-3761-94bd-f8d85d15ac79", "vendor": {"name": "Das"}}], "isExploited": false}
