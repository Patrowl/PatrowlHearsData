A third-party component used in the pump does not verify input buffer size prior to copying, leading to a buffer overflow, allowing remote code execution on the target device. The pump receives the potentially malicious input infrequently and under certain conditions, increasing the difficulty of exploitation.", "datePublished": "2018-02-15T10:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:43:56", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-12718", "https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSMA-17-250-02A", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101252", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100665", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43776/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-12718"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 25.77, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4abc8445-27b8-3cbd-ab60-0c156389a450", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
