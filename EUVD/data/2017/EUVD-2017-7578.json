The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the exif processing module for a PNG file (during XPS conversion). Invalid input leads to a computation where pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:03", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101824"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16384"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 17.92, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0512a334-7092-390d-a5ff-7cee2b596b19", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
