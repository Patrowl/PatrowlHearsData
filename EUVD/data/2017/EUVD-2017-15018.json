OxygenOS and HydrogenOS are vulnerable to downgrade attacks. This is due to a lenient 'updater-script' in OTAs that does not check that the current version is lower than or equal to the given image's. Downgrades can occur even on locked bootloaders and without triggering a factory reset, allowing for exploitation of now-patched vulnerabilities with access to user data. This vulnerability can be exploited by a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacker targeting the update process. This is possible because the update transaction does not occur over TLS (CVE-2016-10370). In addition, a physical attacker can reboot the phone into recovery, and then use 'adb sideload' to push the OTA (on OnePlus 3/3T 'Secure Start-up' must be off).", "datePublished": "2017-05-11T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T15:18:49", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2017008"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5948"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7969303d-fe2b-36af-87bc-c208ba042f59", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7f539c63-2403-39bb-a37d-6747ac799a92", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
