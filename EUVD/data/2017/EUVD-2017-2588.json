An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within processing of the 0x8000E038 IOCTL in the bdfwfpf driver. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
