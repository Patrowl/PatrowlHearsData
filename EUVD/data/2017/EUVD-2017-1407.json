When building a UFO packet with MSG_MORE __ip_append_data() calls ip_ufo_append_data() to append. However in between two send() calls, the append path can be switched from UFO to non-UFO one, which leads to a memory corruption. In case UFO packet lengths exceeds MTU, copy = maxfraglen - skb->len becomes negative on the non-UFO path and the branch to allocate new skb is taken. This triggers fragmentation and computation of fraggap = skb_prev->len - maxfraglen. Fraggap can exceed MTU, causing copy = datalen - transhdrlen - fraggap to become negative. Subsequently skb_copy_and_csum_bits() writes out-of-bounds. A similar issue is present in IPv6 code. The bug was introduced in e89e9cf539a2 (\"[IPv4/IPv6]: UFO Scatter-gather approach\") on Oct 18 2005.", "datePublished": "2017-10-04T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T21:53:06", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000112.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4159", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1932", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1931", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3200", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2931", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2930", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2918", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-1000112", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-1000112.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-1000112", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-1000112.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-1000112.html", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-1000112", "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q3/277", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100262", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "https://github.com/xairy/kernel-exploits/tree/master/CVE-2017-1000112", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039162", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45147/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000112"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 82.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "05fc77b8-e15d-38b4-a060-11a50377d673", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2066b257-297d-338f-a122-292b84053481", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
