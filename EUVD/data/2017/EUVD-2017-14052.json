On Workstation, this may allow a guest to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs Workstation. In the case of a Horizon View Client, this may allow a View desktop to execute code or perform a Denial of Service on the Windows OS that runs the Horizon View Client. Exploitation is only possible if virtual printing has been enabled. This feature is not enabled by default on Workstation but it is enabled by default on Horizon View Client.", "datePublished": "2017-11-17T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:18:03", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2017-0018.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039836", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039835", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101902"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-4935"], "assigner": "vmware", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3a41cde0-0264-3217-ab8e-f3e0bc985637", "product": {"name": "Workstation"}, "product_version": "12.x before 12.5.8"}, {"id": "ea6760b5-aaab-38b8-a3aa-6dd7bdd37ead", "product": {"name": "Horizon View Client for Windows"}, "product_version": "4.x before 4.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1281916d-9fd5-31b6-90dc-28f8e3dacdb9", "vendor": {"name": "VMware"}}], "isExploited": false}
