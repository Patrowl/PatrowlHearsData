An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the affected device.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the affected code area. The vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP (versions 1, 2c, and 3). The attacker must know the SNMP read only community string (SNMP version 2c or earlier) or the user credentials (SNMPv3). An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or to cause a reload of the affected system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2017-07-17T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-21T23:55:37", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99345", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038808", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170629-snmp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6739", "https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2017-6739"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-6739"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 21.61, "exploitedSince": "2022-03-03T00:00:00", "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a68080e3-2fee-3048-94d6-f50407199850", "product": {"name": "Universal Product"}, "product_version": "N/A"}, {"id": "f2fd63ae-0fcc-3cd2-b78b-2003c8609929", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE"}, "product_version": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "706d3787-c9e9-3e77-a8f6-3cdd58ac89ed", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}, {"id": "a9f3de42-932c-3d98-90d2-43e0a82898ce", "vendor": {"name": "IntelliShield"}}], "isExploited": true}
