The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the module that handles character codes for certain textual representations. Invalid input leads to a computation where the pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101824"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16363"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 17.92, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "20172b56-4d34-39a7-88c9-1b615dbf9192", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
