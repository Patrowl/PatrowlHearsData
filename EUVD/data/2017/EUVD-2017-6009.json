Several areas have been identified in the Documents and Emails module that could allow an authenticated user to perform SQL injection, as demonstrated by a backslash character at the end of a bean_id to modules/Emails/DetailView.php. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted SQL request to the affected areas. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify the SQL database. Proper SQL escaping has been added to prevent such exploits.", "datePublished": "2017-09-17T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T19:27:40", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.synology.com/support/security/Synology_SA_17_53_SugarCRM", "https://blog.ripstech.com/2017/sugarcrm-security-diet-multiple-vulnerabilities/", "https://support.sugarcrm.com/Resources/Security/sugarcrm-sa-2017-006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-14508"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ecb7ed26-4caa-36d0-8b82-f5cd9fb9fd62", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c94a02aa-8539-33ae-8815-a9b7d153b2f3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
