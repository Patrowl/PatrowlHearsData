The user uses the web management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet access. This device acts as a Wireless Blood pressure monitor and is used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an attacker who is connected to the Blipcare's device wireless network to easily sniff these values using a MITM attack.", "datePublished": "2019-07-02T20:33:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:12:40", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-11578", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153225/Blipcare-Clear-Text-Communication-Memory-Corruption.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Blipcare_sec_issues.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-11578"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "08ac04bb-33fc-3159-b7ab-d2f09801bacb", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d726defd-657e-3cd6-adfe-d7ed07fb2d23", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
