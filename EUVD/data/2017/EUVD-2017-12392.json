Supported versions that are affected are 8.5.2 and 8.5.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Outside In Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS v3.0 Base Score 8.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).", "datePublished": "2017-01-27T22:01:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-09T19:37:08", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95532", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037631", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2017-2881727.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3271"], "assigner": "oracle", "epss": 1.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d233bc71-64c5-3a2d-b18c-6d85d3c77d10", "product": {"name": "Outside In Technology"}, "product_version": "8.5.2"}, {"id": "db83ab0f-3922-33ee-8c88-092d9c40dbbf", "product": {"name": "Outside In Technology"}, "product_version": "8.5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b3d920ba-fbf5-32e7-9d14-ab5813912ad8", "vendor": {"name": "Oracle"}}], "isExploited": false}
