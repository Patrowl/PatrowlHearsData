The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of crafted CIP packets destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted CIP packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
