This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on user-controlled input in an HTTP request to the targeted device. An attacker in possession of router login credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system.", "datePublished": "2018-05-04T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T19:42:22", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airlink/software_reference_docs/technical-bulletin/swi-psa-2018-003-technical-bulletin-reaper/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-15043"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "56fd5208-54fe-3c74-8fb2-3e98d2c24ea6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6daa5cea-793c-379d-858a-2dcadcd55dd4", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
