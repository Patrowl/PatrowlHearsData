The outcome is that encrypted mail passing through this device does not work (Denial of Service), and a common real-world consequence is a request to resend the mail in the clear (Information Disclosure).", "datePublished": "2017-05-03T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T15:56:36", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://gist.github.com/dkg/a1998c861bf2430e0d01d586905b11cb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-7229"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "513c17a6-b272-3518-9137-3f60934fead9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "84bf19fb-4031-3480-bdd3-c2758fe266fc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
