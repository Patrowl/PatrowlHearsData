A heap out-of-bounds write or read occurs in next_state_val() during regular expression compilation. Octal numbers larger than 0xff are not handled correctly in fetch_token() and fetch_token_in_cc(). A malformed regular expression containing an octal number in the form of '\\700' would produce an invalid code point value larger than 0xff in next_state_val(), resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.", "datePublished": "2017-05-24T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:02:44", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-9226.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1296", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-9226", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-9226.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-9226.html", "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/55", "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/f015fbdd95f76438cd86366467bb2b39870dd7c6", "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/b4bf968ad52afe14e60a2dc8a95d3555c543353a", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101244"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-9226"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.99, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5566686f-01a1-31ca-884f-cab9002eb86a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "03563636-2039-3ffd-a699-514fa07521ef", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
