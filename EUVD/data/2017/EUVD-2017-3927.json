The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not sufficiently protect system software version information when the software responds to HTTP requests that are sent to the web-based interface of the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information about the software, which the attacker could use to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.
