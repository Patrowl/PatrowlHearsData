This affects Linux Kernel version 4.11.5. This is a different issue than CVE-2017-1000370 and CVE-2017-1000365. This issue appears to be limited to i386 based systems.", "datePublished": "2017-06-19T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T22:00:40", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000371.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1524", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-1000371", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-1000371.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-1000371.html", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-1000371", "https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99131", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42276/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42273/", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000371"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000371"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9fc0302-c406-3b62-a26f-0f483ee08f6f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f42afc13-f25d-334c-b917-06e424aee14c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
