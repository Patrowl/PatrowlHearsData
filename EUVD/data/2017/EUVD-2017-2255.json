This vulnerability in the Sun/MS-RPC ALG services component of Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a repeated denial of service against the target. Repeated traffic in a cluster may cause repeated flip-flop failure operations or full failure to the flowd daemon halting traffic on all nodes. Only IPv6 traffic is affected by this issue. IPv4 traffic is unaffected. This issues is not seen with to-host traffic. This issue has no relation with HA services themselves, only the ALG service.
