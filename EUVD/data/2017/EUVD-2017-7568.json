The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read in the JPEG 2000 module. An invalid JPEG 2000 input code stream leads to a computation where the pointer arithmetic results in a location outside valid memory locations belonging to the buffer. An attack can be used to obtain sensitive information, such as object heap addresses, etc.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101824"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16374"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 17.92, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "65f27aa0-0126-358a-ae0e-c2050ad5503a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
