Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an extended denial of service condition. This service is not enabled by default and is only supported in high-end SRX platforms. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D45, 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D80 on SRX1400, SRX3400, SRX3600, SRX5400, SRX5600, SRX5800.", "datePublished": "2017-10-13T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:27:42", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10821"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-10619"], "assigner": "juniper", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9ad51cc3-f806-3a48-a4ce-686f231a882a", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D45"}, {"id": "e3277691-3da4-376f-abce-f1739f64e826", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D80"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "77a4bd8b-7ca3-3559-bdae-6389140eea7f", "vendor": {"name": "Juniper Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
