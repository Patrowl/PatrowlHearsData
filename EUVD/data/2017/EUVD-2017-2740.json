{"id": "EUVD-2017-2740", "enisaUuid": "0e5f23cc-4eca-32d3-a954-bc3e8d85c990", "description": "Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.", "datePublished": "2017-07-13T13:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:57:57", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-11103.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3912", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3909", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-11103", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-11103.html", "https://support.apple.com/HT208221", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3912", "https://support.apple.com/HT208144", "https://www.orpheus-lyre.info/", "https://www.freebsd.org/security/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:05.heimdal.asc", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99551", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039427", "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2017-11103.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038876", "https://support.apple.com/HT208112", "https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/releases/tag/heimdal-7.4.0", "http://www.h5l.org/advisories.html?show=2017-07-11"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-11103"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5a1e50ef-64ac-3a81-af8c-7f6f85d49a30", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a6ce2a9-3fe9-3207-8ec2-2f607beddab1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
