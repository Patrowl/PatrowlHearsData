These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update, version 4.4.0.58, has been released which addresses the aforementioned vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2017-09-27T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T21:09:03", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170926_00", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100939"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-13676"], "assigner": "symantec", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "38054a23-b495-38c9-84b1-f0c110f74693", "product": {"name": "Norton Remove & Reinstall"}, "product_version": "Prior to 4.4.0.58"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a325f3a4-dd84-37b9-9d24-79d70782b2ff", "vendor": {"name": "Symantec Corporation"}}], "isExploited": false}
