The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url \"/port_3480\". It seems that the UPnP services provide \"file\" as one of the service actions for a normal user to read a file that is stored under the /etc/cmh-lu folder. It retrieves the value from the \"parameters\" query string variable and then passes it to an internal function \"FileUtils::ReadFileIntoBuffer\" which is a library function that does not perform any sanitization on the value submitted and this allows an attacker to use directory traversal characters \"../\" and read files from other folders within the device.", "datePublished": "2019-06-17T19:52:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:02:44", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-9382", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-9382"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81e58e46-a87b-3a4b-b6d3-a49904f832a1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "591f806f-964b-3047-8a48-ccefe02bb63d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
