If the default protocol is specified to be FILE or a file: URL lacks two slashes, the given \"URL\" starts with a drive letter, and libcurl is built for Windows or DOS, then libcurl would copy the path 7 bytes off, so that the end of the given path would write beyond the malloc buffer (7 bytes being the length in bytes of the ascii string \"file://\").", "datePublished": "2017-06-14T13:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:11:01", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-9502.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038697", "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/14/1", "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170614.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99120"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-9502"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7b18f4a6-190c-3de4-af97-563b8e9ac1f0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "20b8802c-ba58-31cd-8a7d-55f49b1ee6dc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
