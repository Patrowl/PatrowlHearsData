The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing functions (the rfc2047 function in mbox.c). An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email to the affected device. This action could cause a buffer overflow condition when ClamAV scans the malicious email, allowing the attacker to potentially cause a DoS condition on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2018-01-26T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-02T21:26:40", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-12375.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-12375", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-12375.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-12375", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-12375.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3550-1/", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3550-2/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/01/msg00035.html", "https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11940", "http://blog.clamav.net/2018/01/clamav-0993-has-been-released.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-12375"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 6.46, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8b49f35-2ed5-319b-855e-d8d08b397cb6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
