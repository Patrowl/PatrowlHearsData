Sage XRT Treasury is a business finance management application. Database user access privileges are determined by the USER_CODE field associated with the querying user. By modifying the USER_CODE value to match that of a privileged user, a low-privileged, authenticated user may gain privileged access to the SQL database. A remote, authenticated user can submit specially crafted SQL queries to gain privileged access to the application database.", "datePublished": "2018-07-24T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T14:16:28", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/742632", "https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96477"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3183"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 1.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03794221-c50b-3a05-808b-90a51a108628", "product": {"name": "XRT Treasury"}, "product_version": "3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75fc9df2-1cb5-365d-8a15-d7d2c7797cdb", "vendor": {"name": "Sage"}}], "isExploited": false}
