{"id": "EUVD-2017-2252", "enisaUuid": "46cc6212-858f-3c4f-9cf1-8c9e5089b7d9", "description": "On all vSRX and SRX Series devices, when the DHCP or DHCP relay is configured, specially crafted packet might cause the flowd process to crash, halting or interrupting traffic from flowing through the device(s). Repeated crashes of the flowd process may constitute an extended denial of service condition for the device(s). If the device is configured in high-availability, the RG1+ (data-plane) will fail-over to the secondary node. If the device is configured in stand-alone, there will be temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restored automatically. Sustained crafted packets may cause the secondary failover node to fail back, or fail completely, potentially halting flowd on both nodes of the cluster or causing flip-flop failovers to occur. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67 on vSRX or SRX Series; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D50 on vSRX or SRX Series; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D91, 15.1X49-D100 on vSRX or SRX Series.", "datePublished": "2017-07-14T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:01:06", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038891", "https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10789"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-10605"], "assigner": "juniper", "epss": 0.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5f476e8e-8113-30f6-8a3b-7ec48993ffb5", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D91, 15.1X49-D100"}, {"id": "ac6f5540-18fd-3dbb-af7c-93705e75acae", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67"}, {"id": "e1c68b90-d151-3a4e-a821-457e502ed850", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D50"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d8e15c00-46e9-3a11-a3f4-1e2b9cc48159", "vendor": {"name": "Juniper Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
