The device requires that a user logging into the device provide a username and password. However, the device allows D-Link apps on the mobile devices and desktop to communicate with the device without any authentication. As a part of that communication, the device uses custom version of base64 encoding to pass data back and forth between the apps and the device. However, the same form of communication can be initiated by any process including an attacker process on the mobile phone or the desktop and this allows a third party to retrieve the device's password without any authentication by sending just 1 UDP packet with custom base64 encoding. The severity of this attack is enlarged by the fact that there more than 100,000 D-Link devices out there.", "datePublished": "2019-07-02T20:03:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:34:23", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-8417", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153226/Dlink-DCS-1130-Command-Injection-CSRF-Stack-Overflow.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Dlink_DCS_1130_security.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8417"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b7c9c85-7929-3ae9-8e66-8eeefa4ff1d0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eecd2f1a-27d0-309a-b412-b85ed15f0422", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
