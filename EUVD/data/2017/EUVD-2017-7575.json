The vulnerability is caused by a buffer access with an incorrect length value when processing TIFF files embedded within an XPS document. Crafted TIFF image input causes a mismatch between allocated buffer size and the access allowed by the computation. If an attacker can adequately control the accessible memory then this vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101831"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16381"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 26.27, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a041ec60-956a-3bdb-b76c-fa79a1f59d5b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
