The logout mechanism does not check for authorization. Therefore, an attacker only needs to know the device ID. This causes a denial of service. This might be interpreted as a vulnerability in customer-controlled software, in the sense that the StashCat client side has no secure way to signal that it is ending a session and that data should be deleted.", "datePublished": "2017-08-01T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:57:57", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jul/90"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-11135"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb918d51-47fd-34f1-95b8-5f2123c27ed4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22e99501-259c-3efb-98e6-43e30a360d8b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
