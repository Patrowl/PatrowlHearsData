This kernel vulnerability was fixed in April 2015 by commit a87938b2e246b81b4fb713edb371a9fa3c5c3c86 (backported to Linux 3.10.77 in May 2015), but it was not recognized as a security threat. With CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_RANDOMIZE_PIE enabled, and a normal top-down address allocation strategy, load_elf_binary() will attempt to map a PIE binary into an address range immediately below mm->mmap_base. Unfortunately, load_elf_ binary() does not take account of the need to allocate sufficient space for the entire binary which means that, while the first PT_LOAD segment is mapped below mm->mmap_base, the subsequent PT_LOAD segment(s) end up being mapped above mm->mmap_base into the are that is supposed to be the \"gap\" between the stack and the binary.", "datePublished": "2017-10-04T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-21T23:55:32", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000253.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2802", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2801", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2800", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2799", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2798", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2797", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2796", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2795", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2794", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2793", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:1842", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-1000253.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-1000253.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039434", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101010", "https://www.qualys.com/2017/09/26/cve-2017-1000253/cve-2017-1000253.txt", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000253", "https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2017-1000253"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000253"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 57.21, "exploitedSince": "2024-09-09T00:00:00", "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "73822e62-a44c-312d-978c-79a104883eed", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "58156f90-1abf-3af1-9a0e-704db6794721", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": true}
