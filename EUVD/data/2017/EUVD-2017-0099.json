The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.", "datePublished": "2017-01-10T15:59:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:16", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://python-hyper.org/priority/en/latest/security/CVE-2016-6580.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92311", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6580", "https://github.com/python-hyper/priority/commit/7d01a7dc4db83bce50f20d47caf4f37b403a3ecd", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/priority/PYSEC-2017-93.yaml", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160806004329/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92311"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-6580", "PYSEC-2017-93"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a385896-ede6-3a3b-b256-3808699997f2", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0819b004-d192-3e2a-a944-f9ff1e7b77be", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
