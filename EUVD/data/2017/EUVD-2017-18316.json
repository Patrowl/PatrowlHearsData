The device provides a user with the capability of installing or deleting apps on the device using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who navigates to an attacker controlled page to install or delete an application on the device. Note: The cross-site request forgery is a systemic issue across all other functionalities of the device.", "datePublished": "2019-06-17T17:27:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:02:44", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-9381", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153242/Veralite-Veraedge-Router-XSS-Command-Injection-CSRF-Traversal.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Vera_sec_issues.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-9381"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "78aab7d0-9903-367c-ad7e-99d730b2b9e3", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "947239df-d270-3394-adc9-ced9a4e8afa6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
