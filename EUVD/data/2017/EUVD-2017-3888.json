The attacker would have to be authenticated as an administrative user to conduct this attack. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper masking of sensitive information in system log files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and viewing the system log file. An exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive system information that should have been restricted. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.
