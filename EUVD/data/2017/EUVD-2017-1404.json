This too large value is then used in the sendto() call, making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually put into the buffer. The endto() function will then read beyond the end of the heap based buffer. A malicious HTTP(S) server could redirect a vulnerable libcurl-using client to a crafted TFTP URL (if the client hasn't restricted which protocols it allows redirects to) and trick it to send private memory contents to a remote server over UDP. Limit curl's redirect protocols with --proto-redir and libcurl's with CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS.", "datePublished": "2017-10-04T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T21:53:06", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000100.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-1000100", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-1000100.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-1000100", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-1000100.html", "https://support.apple.com/HT208221", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100286", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-14", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039118", "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809B.html", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000100"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f618ce4e-83c1-3318-9e11-e7ee0009cd71", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de8c9a80-10f4-3819-a96f-1cb93f082ca6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
