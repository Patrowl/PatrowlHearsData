The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform proper input validation of HTTP requests that it receives and the software does not apply role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the affected system.
