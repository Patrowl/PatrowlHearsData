The TEE application which uses secure camera expects those buffers to contain data captured during the current camera session. It is possible though for HLOS to put aside and reuse one or more of the protected buffers with previously captured data during next camera session. Such data reuse must be prevented as the TEE applications expects to receive valid data captured during the current session only.", "datePublished": "2018-04-11T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T20:12:18", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-04-01", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103671"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-18125"], "assigner": "qualcomm", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "767ad9d2-bb69-3799-b80a-ab6843807943", "product": {"name": "Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wear"}, "product_version": "MDM9206, MDM9607, MDM9650, SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 835, SD 845, SD 850"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa5738da-9189-34d2-a3d8-5bc2ce252449", "vendor": {"name": "Qualcomm, Inc."}}], "isExploited": false}
