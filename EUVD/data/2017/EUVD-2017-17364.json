The device has a custom binary called mp4ts under the /var/www/video folder. It seems that this binary dumps the HTTP VERB in the system logs. As a part of doing that it retrieves the HTTP VERB sent by the user and uses a vulnerable sprintf function at address 0x0000C3D4 in the function sub_C210 to copy the value into a string and then into a log file. Since there is no bounds check being performed on the environment variable at address 0x0000C360 this results in a stack overflow and overwrites the PC register allowing an attacker to execute buffer overflow or even a command injection attack.", "datePublished": "2019-07-02T20:08:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:34:23", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-8412", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153226/Dlink-DCS-1130-Command-Injection-CSRF-Stack-Overflow.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Dlink_DCS_1130_security.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8412"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "596401f1-e45a-3a1e-b820-0225892ca302", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bce8dff3-acef-3dee-bdf1-1b1fd19d82f0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
