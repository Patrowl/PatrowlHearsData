To perform those actions on an entry, the user needs to know the corresponding \"CredentialId\" value, which uniquely identifies a password safe entry. Since \"CredentialId\" values are implemented as GUIDs, they are hard to guess. However, if for example an entry's owner grants read-only access to a malicious user, the value gets exposed to the malicious user. The same holds true for temporary grants.", "datePublished": "2018-07-31T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:59:17", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.profundis-labs.com/advisories/CVE-2017-17707.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-17707"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d12cdc04-4c72-3137-b3b2-13c1385f2243", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "09960311-e2e0-33ea-a93b-a70a1b12c681", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
