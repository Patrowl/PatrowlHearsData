Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong.

Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.", "datePublished": "2017-10-30T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T19:57:27", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-15597.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4050", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-236.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101564", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/10/24/3", "https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX229057", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039653", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00009.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-15597"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e8bf0790-c9c7-34dc-8b20-04743874b384", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "13fec7e1-b788-355a-ad89-fd862d696c77", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
