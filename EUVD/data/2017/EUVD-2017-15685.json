The vulnerability exists because the firmware of an affected device fails to handle certain XML values that are passed to the HTTP RPC service listening on the local subnet of the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malformed request to an affected device. A successful attack could cause the affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. Yes has updated the affected devices with firmware that addresses this vulnerability. Customers are not required to take action. Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability affects YesMaxTotal, YesMax HD, and YesQuattro STB devices.
