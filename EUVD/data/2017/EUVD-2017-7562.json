This vulnerability leads to a stack-based buffer overflow condition in the internal Unicode string manipulation module. It is triggered by an invalid PDF file, where a crafted Unicode string causes an out of bounds memory access of a stack allocated buffer, due to improper checks when manipulating an offset of a pointer to the buffer. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability and achieve arbitrary code execution if they can effectively control the accessible memory.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T14:55:32", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101816"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16368"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 18.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cbbda4c3-af0a-36e3-8781-572817f16544", "product": {"name": "Adobe Acrobat Reader 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, 11.0.22 and earlier versions"}, "product_version": "Adobe Acrobat Reader 2017.012.20098 and earlier versions, 2017.011.30066 and earlier versions, 2015.006.30355 and earlier versions, 11.0.22 and earlier versions"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "096e4355-fdf9-34ed-a542-df8d6f27ff75", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
