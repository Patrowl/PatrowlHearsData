This attack occurs when an attacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.", "datePublished": "2017-01-10T15:59:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:04", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://python-hyper.org/hpack/en/latest/security/CVE-2016-6581.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92315", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-ffq8-576r-v26g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-6581", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/hpack/PYSEC-2017-87.yaml", "https://github.com/python-hyper/hpack", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200227233559/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92315", "http://python-hyper.org/projects/hpack/en/stable/security/CVE-2016-6581.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-6581.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-6581", "GHSA-ffq8-576r-v26g", "PYSEC-2017-87"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e4b85f39-9cbe-3f0d-8c58-57035433ed3f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "439a593a-4121-3ca6-bbfe-1290c56214ac", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
