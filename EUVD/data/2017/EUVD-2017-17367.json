The device has a custom telnet daemon as a part of the busybox and retrieves the password from the shadow file using the function getspnam at address 0x00053894. Then performs a crypt operation on the password retrieved from the user at address 0x000538E0 and performs a strcmp at address 0x00053908 to check if the password is correct or incorrect. However, the /etc/shadow file is a part of CRAM-FS filesystem which means that the user cannot change the password and hence a hardcoded hash in /etc/shadow is used to match the credentials provided by the user. This is a salted hash of the string \"admin\" and hence it acts as a password to the device which cannot be changed as the whole filesystem is read only.", "datePublished": "2019-07-02T20:13:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:34:22", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-8415", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153226/Dlink-DCS-1130-Command-Injection-CSRF-Stack-Overflow.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Dlink_DCS_1130_security.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8415"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "284ff7d6-7bcf-3b4e-894a-3fddb71e603c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2402f483-baf5-34fd-be4e-86f3b21b065e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
