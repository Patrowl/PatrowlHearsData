The port in question was used by the StatestoreSubscriber class which did not use the appropriate secure Thrift transport when TLS was turned on. It was therefore possible for an adversary, with access to the network, to eavesdrop on the packets going to and coming from that port and view the data in plaintext.", "datePublished": "2017-07-10T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T16:42:27", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5bab4424f23aebefc8108a0e30273c2a543a289df8113c461f930143@%3Cdev.impala.apache.org%3E", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540831/100/0/threaded", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5bab4424f23aebefc8108a0e30273c2a543a289df8113c461f930143%40%3Cdev.impala.apache.org%3E"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5652"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "97486b04-28b1-30d1-8bf4-2a4d5b537386", "product": {"name": "Apache Impala"}, "product_version": "2.7.0 to 2.8.0 incubating"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2eb669cb-c6ba-3388-a8e7-077079cdd27a", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
