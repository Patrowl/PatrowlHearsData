A heap out-of-bounds write occurs in bitset_set_range() during regular expression compilation due to an uninitialized variable from an incorrect state transition. An incorrect state transition in parse_char_class() could create an execution path that leaves a critical local variable uninitialized until it's used as an index, resulting in an out-of-bounds write memory corruption.", "datePublished": "2017-05-24T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T17:02:43", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-9228.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:1296", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-9228", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-9228.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-9228.html", "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/commit/3b63d12038c8d8fc278e81c942fa9bec7c704c8b", "https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma/issues/60"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-9228"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.85, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "08dac906-831f-391d-981a-ce0911e10ce9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a8df3269-95f3-33ff-8258-7adad32a12f3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
