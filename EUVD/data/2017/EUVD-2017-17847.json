An attacker who can login to Bamboo as a user without the edit permission for deployment projects is able to use this vulnerability, provided there is an existing plan with a green build, to create a deployment project and execute arbitrary code on an available Bamboo Agent.  By default a local agent is enabled; this means that code execution can occur on the system hosting Bamboo as the user running Bamboo.", "datePublished": "2017-06-14T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-16T13:45:59", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-security-advisory-2017-06-14-907283498.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99090"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8907"], "assigner": "atlassian", "epss": 0.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7bbe8a98-af9c-3e63-85ff-8697a85524e4", "product": {"name": "Atlassian Bamboo"}, "product_version": "5.0.0 \u2264 version < 5.15.7"}, {"id": "9870ab53-17cf-3103-98a3-cd479d177e3f", "product": {"name": "Atlassian Bamboo"}, "product_version": "6.0.0 \u2264 version < 6.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db84cce7-8561-3455-83da-a9e61821f840", "vendor": {"name": "Atlassian"}}], "isExploited": false}
