However, since the default URI is not using https, it is vulnerable to a MiTM and the Gradle executable is not safe. The severity of this issue is high due to the fact that the build scripts immediately start a build after Gradle has been fetched. Developers who are concerned about this issue should install version 6.1.2 or higher of Cordova-Android. If developers are unable to install the latest version, this vulnerability can easily be mitigated by setting the CORDOVA_ANDROID_GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_URL environment variable to https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip", "datePublished": "2018-02-01T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:56:14", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2017/01/27/android-612.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95838", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3160"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b141310d-52b3-3463-96b0-7b2c0c44fd85", "product": {"name": "Apache Cordova Android"}, "product_version": "Apache Cordova 6.1.0 and below"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94172d77-6741-3ea6-80d0-b49dc7f875f3", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
