Dahua IP camera products include an application known as Sonia (/usr/bin/sonia) that provides the web interface and other services for controlling the IP camera remotely. Versions of Sonia included in firmware versions prior to DH_IPC-Consumer-Zi-Themis_Eng_P_V2.408.0000.11.R.20170621 do not validate input data length for the 'password' field of the web interface. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may submit a crafted POST request to the IP camera's Sonia web interface that may lead to out-of-bounds memory operations and loss of availability or remote code execution. The issue was originally identified by the researcher in firmware version DH_IPC-HX1X2X-Themis_EngSpnFrn_N_V2.400.0000.30.R.20160803.", "datePublished": "2018-07-24T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T14:16:28", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/547255", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99620"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3223"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 11.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7baedce9-e3d5-316c-8dcc-51b865bcbb00", "product": {"name": "IP Camera"}, "product_version": "DH_IPC-Consumer-Zi-Themis_Eng_P_V2.408.0000.11.R.20170621 <DH_IPC-Consumer-Zi-Themis_Eng_P_V2.408.0000.11.R.20170621"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "068cec95-4964-34b9-a597-64e745c7ce0b", "vendor": {"name": "Dahua"}}], "isExploited": false}
