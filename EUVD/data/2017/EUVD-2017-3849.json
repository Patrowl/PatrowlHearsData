The attacker could read or write information from the SQL database. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation on user-supplied input within SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected application. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values and write malicious input in the SQL database. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software Releases prior to 12.3.
