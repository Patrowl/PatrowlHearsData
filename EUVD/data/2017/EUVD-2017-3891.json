{"id": "EUVD-2017-3891", "enisaUuid": "213ab895-76da-3bf9-889a-1acf60dedf72", "description": "A vulnerability in the TCP state machine of Cisco RF Gateway 1 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent an affected device from delivering switched digital video (SDV) or video on demand (VoD) streams, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a processing error with TCP connections to the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a large number of TCP connections to an affected device and not actively closing those TCP connections. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the affected device from delivering SDV or VoD streams to set-top boxes.
