This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is a part of the image conversion module that handles XPS files. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:03", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102140"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16418"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 6.59, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ee07ab8-acfe-3880-97f0-64b1d0c69b59", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
