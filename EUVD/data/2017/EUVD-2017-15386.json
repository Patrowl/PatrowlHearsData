This issue is caused when an application builds a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable in a way that allows the attacker to control which file is executed at run time. This file inclusion vulnerability subverts how an application loads code for execution. Successful exploitation of a file inclusion vulnerability will result in remote code execution on the web server that runs the affected web application.", "datePublished": "2017-06-26T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T15:25:49", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038785", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98890", "https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170621_00"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-6325"], "assigner": "symantec", "epss": 3.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8e7428f4-0fb7-3e39-999f-1eeaf1978a7d", "product": {"name": "Messaging Gateway"}, "product_version": "All versions prior to version 10.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7f3c796-2d6d-3812-945b-864351b9d4b2", "vendor": {"name": "Symantec Corporation"}}], "isExploited": false}
