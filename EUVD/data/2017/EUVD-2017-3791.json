The vulnerability is due to the failure of AMP to scan certain EML attachments that could contain malware. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a crafted EML attachment through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured ESA email message and content filtering and allow the malware to be delivered to the end user. Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA, both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments on the ESA.
