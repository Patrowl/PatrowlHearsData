In the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an omission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a carefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap based buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead of crashing. An example of a URL that triggers the flaw would be `http://ur%20[0-60000000000000000000`.", "datePublished": "2017-10-04T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T21:53:06", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000101.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3558", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-1000101", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-1000101.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-1000101", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-1000101.html", "https://support.apple.com/HT208221", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-14", "https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809A.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039117", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100249", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3992"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000101"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aca43d30-dca3-39f5-a79b-b92d2249f223", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75895838-3588-3bc7-bfe5-7be87bde035a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
