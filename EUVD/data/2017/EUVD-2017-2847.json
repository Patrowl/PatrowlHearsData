This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer due to an integer overflow; the computation is part of the abstraction that creates an arbitrarily sized transparent or opaque bitmap image. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:05:28", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3222", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-11213.html", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb17-33.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201711-13", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101837", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039778"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-11213"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 11.38, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eb5635a9-6503-3f11-98e2-8aea941e782b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
