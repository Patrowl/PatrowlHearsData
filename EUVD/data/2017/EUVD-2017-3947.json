The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation checking mechanisms during certain mail parsing operations (mbox.c operations on bounce messages). If successfully exploited, the ClamAV software could allow a variable pointing to the mail body which could cause a used after being free (use-after-free) instance which may lead to a disruption of services on an affected device to include a denial of service condition.", "datePublished": "2018-01-26T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-02T21:26:51", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-12374.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-12374", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-12374.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-12374", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-12374.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3550-1/", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3550-2/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/01/msg00035.html", "http://blog.clamav.net/2018/01/clamav-0993-has-been-released.html", "https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11939"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-12374"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 4.84, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a64be505-f9ed-3404-a142-26891bb4272c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
