{"id": "EUVD-2017-12854", "enisaUuid": "439397c6-6288-3dda-b4e2-a2adf63d1cc0", "description": "OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an \"error state\" mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.", "datePublished": "2017-12-07T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T03:53:31", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-3737.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4065", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2187", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2186", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2185", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0998", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-3737", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-3737.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-3737", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-3737.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-3737.html", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/898fb884b706aaeb283de4812340bb0bde8476dc", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2018-3236628.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180419-0002/", "https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-17:12.openssl.asc", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201712-03", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039978", "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt", "https://www.digitalmunition.me/2017/12/cve-2017-3737-openssl-security-bypass-vulnerability/", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-179516.pdf", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102103", "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2017-16", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20180117-0002/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20171208-0001/", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3737"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 42.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f322d21c-b8de-31ea-904c-d7ac0fbc5d6e", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "1.0.2b-1.0.2m"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "445544d3-23ab-33a3-9fda-944e8568d95a", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
