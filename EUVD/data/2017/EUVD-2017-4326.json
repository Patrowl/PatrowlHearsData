This could be leveraged by remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain resultant privileged (root) code execution on the switch, because incoming packet data can contain embedded OS commands, and can also trigger a stack-based buffer overflow.", "datePublished": "2017-08-22T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:51:07", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-12787", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42518/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-12787"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 34.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3d45471-83d1-3be4-8617-bcdbc4d40873", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cfbdc632-487b-3f97-8cb5-797624b56889", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
