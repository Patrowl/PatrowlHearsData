The Swift object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request. NOTE: github.com/openstack/swauth URLs do not mean that Swauth is maintained by an official OpenStack project team.", "datePublished": "2017-11-21T13:29:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-25T04:30:33", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/openstack/swauth/commit/70af7986265a3defea054c46efc82d0698917298", "https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1655781", "https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=882314", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-4044", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101926", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16613", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/swauth/PYSEC-2017-84.yaml", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200227140059/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101926"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16613", "PYSEC-2017-84"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aa37cf5e-025f-36f6-ae2c-602c16fbf748", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2eefff1b-fbe2-3c6d-8999-2b2b1d2ea7dc", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
