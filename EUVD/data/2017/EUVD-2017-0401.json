The vulnerability could corrupt memory in a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.", "datePublished": "2017-03-17T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T12:47:57", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0034", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96786", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038006"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-0034"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 23.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e89966b4-915b-366c-aaa7-2e21cbb26c43", "product": {"name": "Edge"}, "product_version": "Edge"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "99d33a8d-5575-3bd7-956a-aad40cbdbcc7", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft Corporation"}}], "isExploited": false}
