This vulnerability occurs as a result of a computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer; the computation is part of the WebCapture module, related to an internal hash table implementation. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:03", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101813"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16411"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 6.59, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "65807c99-7f80-31f9-b3b9-5167de48a254", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
