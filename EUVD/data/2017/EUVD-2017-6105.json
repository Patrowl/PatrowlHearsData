In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.", "datePublished": "2017-09-20T08:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T19:34:39", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-14604.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3994", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0223", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-14604.html", "https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/2238", "https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=860268", "https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/commit/1630f53481f445ada0a455e9979236d31a8d3bb0", "https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777991", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101012", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3994", "https://github.com/GNOME/nautilus/commit/bc919205bf774f6af3fa7154506c46039af5a69b", "https://micahflee.com/2017/04/breaking-the-security-model-of-subgraph-os/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-14604"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "283d7ae0-655d-37f6-ba7e-72378847296f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dfae6e99-9145-3b0f-a9c0-f6ffe70915d9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
