The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform proper input validation of HTTP requests and fails to apply role-based access controls (RBACs) to requested HTTP URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that uses directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete any file from the system.
