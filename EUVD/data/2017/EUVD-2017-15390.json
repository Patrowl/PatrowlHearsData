These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, the application will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The exploitation of the vulnerability manifests as a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign executable running under the context of the application.", "datePublished": "2017-08-21T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:59:48", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170821_00", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100200"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-6329"], "assigner": "symantec", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ab3c04c-aa80-374b-a7b1-4688b7442533", "product": {"name": "VIP Access for Desktop"}, "product_version": "prior to 2.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3a45d9d3-ab2b-3491-8abd-a3510d5e7dc5", "vendor": {"name": "Symantec Corporation"}}], "isExploited": false}
