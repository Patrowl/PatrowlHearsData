An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credential and the ability to communicate directly with the Mirth Connect management console may be able to intercept sensitive patient information.

Customers do not have the option to change the Mirth Connect admin account password. The Mirth Connect admin account is created during the Connex install.
