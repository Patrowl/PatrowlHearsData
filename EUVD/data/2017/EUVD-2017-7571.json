This vulnerability is due to a computation that accesses a pointer that has not been initialized in the main DLL. In this case, a computation defines a read from an unexpected memory location. Therefore, an attacker might be able to read sensitive portions of memory.", "datePublished": "2017-12-09T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T20:27:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039791", "https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/acrobat/apsb17-36.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101821"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16377"], "assigner": "adobe", "epss": 16.38, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d78138be-59e5-3608-875b-80604cf6d617", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
