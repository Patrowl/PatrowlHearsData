As the result of this design, any authenticated user may create his own dmr_content object, pointing to already existing content in the Content Server filesystem.", "datePublished": "2017-10-13T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T19:42:22", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-15014", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101639", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43005/", "http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2017/Oct/19"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-15014"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.97, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea34ab6b-561a-320a-8c26-ff5cf897c089", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "361c4e28-359f-3823-89e7-02d19afede75", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
