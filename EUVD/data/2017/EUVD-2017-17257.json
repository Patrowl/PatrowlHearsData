This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function. Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing the original message.", "datePublished": "2017-05-04T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:34:21", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3870", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41963/", "https://exploitbox.io/vuln/WordPress-Exploit-4-7-Unauth-Password-Reset-0day-CVE-2017-8295.html", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3870", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038403", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98295", "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/8807"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8295"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 67.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8249325a-d9ed-380f-a1f6-c2ac40c47885", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2cab1469-5cfb-3f99-bf3d-69aaca12a257", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
