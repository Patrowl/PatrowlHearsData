The binary orthrus in /sbin folder of the device handles all the UPnP connections received by the device. It seems that the binary performs a sprintf operation at address 0x0000A3E4 with the value in the command line parameter \"-f\" and stores it on the stack. Since there is no length check, this results in corrupting the registers for the function sub_A098 which results in memory corruption.", "datePublished": "2019-07-02T19:56:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T16:34:23", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-8414", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153226/Dlink-DCS-1130-Command-Injection-CSRF-Stack-Overflow.html", "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Dlink_DCS_1130_security.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-8414"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8090fc4-bec0-3ee7-bc04-1dd4c568857d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d6133096-3395-3fba-9d40-632c5bb188c3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
