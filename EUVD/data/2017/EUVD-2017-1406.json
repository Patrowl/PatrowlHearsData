This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.", "datePublished": "2017-10-04T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T21:53:06", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000111.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3200", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2931", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2930", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2918", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-1000111", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-1000111", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2017-1000111.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2017-1000111.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100267", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3981", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2017-1000111", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039132"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000111"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d44173d-0841-3537-8022-4e6cfb288b61", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a36b85d2-8e1d-33c0-a20f-b1e0513ebce9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
