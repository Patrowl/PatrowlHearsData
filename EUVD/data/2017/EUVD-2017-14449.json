The findChildrenByFilter() function which is called by the web accessible path /categoriesServlet performs string interpolation and direct SQL query execution. SQL quote escaping and a keyword blacklist were implemented in a new class, SQLUtil (main/java/com/dotmarketing/common/util/SQLUtil.java), as part of the remediation of CVE-2016-8902; however, these can be overcome in the case of the q and inode parameters to the /categoriesServlet path. Overcoming these controls permits a number of blind boolean SQL injection vectors in either parameter. The /categoriesServlet web path can be accessed remotely and without authentication in a default dotCMS deployment.", "datePublished": "2022-05-17T01:19:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-20T03:33:03", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2017-5344", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96259", "https://github.com/xdrr/webapp-exploits/blob/master/vendors/dotcms/2017.01.blind-sqli/dotcms-dump.sh", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/34", "http://dotcms.com/security/SI-39", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41377/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5344"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5344"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 8.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b5f201e6-4b42-33cb-a46c-100651fdf0e8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "803112ef-4371-39c8-8194-123f1646a06b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
