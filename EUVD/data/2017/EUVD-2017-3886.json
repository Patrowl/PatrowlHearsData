The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of path and file names of a DLL file before it is loaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious DLL file and installing it in a specific system directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM account. An attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2017-11-16T07:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:36:56", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-cpt", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101858"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-12313"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ffa8fb77-d1ad-307c-96d6-838d3190cc16", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
