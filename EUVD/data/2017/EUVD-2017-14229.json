In other words, Chrome could transmit cleartext even though the user had entered an https URL, because of a misdesigned workaround for cases where the domain name in a URL almost matches the domain name in an X.509 server certificate (but differs in the initial \"www.\" substring).", "datePublished": "2017-10-27T05:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T14:47:44", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5120.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3985", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2676", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-5120.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-5120", "https://crbug.com/718676", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201709-15", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039291", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100610", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3985", "https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5120"], "assigner": "Chrome", "epss": 0.87, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dbe5e0cb-4883-3fa2-839e-7937dc512b53", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
