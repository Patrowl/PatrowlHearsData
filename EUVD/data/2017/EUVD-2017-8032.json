Given the following situation: the Crowd application is bound to directory 1 and has a user called admin and the Google Apps application is bound to directory 2, which also has a user called admin, it was possible to authenticate REST requests using the credentials of the user coming from directory 2 and impersonate the user from directory 1.", "datePublished": "2018-01-31T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T00:40:54", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CWD-5009"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-16858"], "assigner": "atlassian", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9b3c39a9-f1fd-3342-9f46-d36fb0aa63ec", "product": {"name": "Crowd"}, "product_version": "from 1.5.0 before 3.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d98034a-27b2-31c0-9ebf-dc4575c512f5", "vendor": {"name": "Atlassian"}}], "isExploited": false}
