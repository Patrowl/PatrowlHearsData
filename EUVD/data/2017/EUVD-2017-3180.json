NOTE: this does not affect systems, such as default Debian stretch installations, on which Tor startup relies on a systemd unit file (instead of this tor.init script).", "datePublished": "2017-07-23T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:12:40", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99933", "https://bugs.debian.org/869153"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-11565"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d0e8ec8e-3850-32eb-aa6a-a5b1e51c974f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "85e2b23d-56ae-3fb6-be04-0140e1e56a42", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
