NOTE: it could be argued that this is not a vulnerability in Asterisk, but a class of vulnerabilities that can occur in any program that uses this feature without the associated filtering functionality that is already available.", "datePublished": "2010-02-23T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T00:59:38", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "references": ["http://svn.asterisk.org/svn/asterisk/branches/1.2/README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt", "http://secunia.com/advisories/39096", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1023637", "http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2010-March/037679.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/509608/100/0/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/38641", "http://downloads.digium.com/pub/security/AST-2010-002.html", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2010/0439", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/56397"], "aliases": ["CVE-2010-0685"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "09b4dcae-412d-3432-a9ea-2d2e781a78a1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0764800b-e66f-3af1-82b5-bc39a2cd72ac", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
