NOTE: the vendor reportedly found that only systems with an otherwise vulnerable application are affected, because \"the memory areas accessible from the guest cannot be leveraged to achieve either remote code execution or elevation of privilege and ... no data from the host is exposed to the guest OS.\"", "datePublished": "2010-04-01T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T01:14:06", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/510154/100/0/threaded", "http://www.coresecurity.com/content/virtual-pc-2007-hypervisor-memory-protection-bug", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1023720", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/38764"], "aliases": ["CVE-2010-1225"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 32.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fa9fb2bf-14bc-30ae-b62e-7bc1537413e1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6182348e-16ce-370d-91ac-2a8a9c979f36", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
