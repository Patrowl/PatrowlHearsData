Versions 1.11.11 and below allow TOTP to be used multiple times during its validity window. Users with 2FA enabled are prompted to enter a token during sign-in, and afterward it is not sufficiently marked as used in the system. This allows an attacker who intercepts that token to use it in addition to a known username/password during the 60-second token validity window. The attacker must have intercepted a valid 2FA token (for example, during a screen share). This issue is fixed in version 1.12.0.", "datePublished": "2026-01-06T00:44:23", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-06T19:01:05", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-rgmp-4873-r683", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69197", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/032bf076d92bb2f929fa69c1bac1b89f26b8badf", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel", "https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/releases/tag/v1.12.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-69197", "GHSA-rgmp-4873-r683"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a9700c8-afcb-3b81-bf83-1eaecc44ab3c", "product": {"name": "panel"}, "product_version": "< 1.12.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9dabe973-ca7a-3f3d-9346-67d7dd3b7331", "vendor": {"name": "pterodactyl"}}], "isExploited": false}
