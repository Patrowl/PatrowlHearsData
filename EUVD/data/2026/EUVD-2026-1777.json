This vulnerability, a stack-based buffer overflow, occurs in the filename sanitization logic when processing attacker-controlled URL paths, particularly when filename restriction options are active. A remote attacker can exploit this by providing a specially crafted URL, which, upon user interaction with wget2, can lead to memory corruption. This can cause the application to crash and potentially allow for further malicious activities.", "datePublished": "2026-01-09T07:57:17", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-09T13:58:40", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69195", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-69195", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2425770"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-69195", "GHSA-q2gj-jpwc-8f46"], "assigner": "fedora", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [], "isExploited": false}
