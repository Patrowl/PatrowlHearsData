Prior to versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8, the current rule 922110 has a bug when processing multipart requests with multiple parts. When the first rule in a chain iterates over a collection (like `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), the capture variables (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) get overwritten with each iteration. Only the last captured value is available to the chained rule, which means malicious charsets in earlier parts can be missed if a later part has a legitimate charset. Versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8 patch the issue.", "datePublished": "2026-01-08T13:55:37", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-08T15:55:33", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/security/advisories/GHSA-36fv-25j3-r2c5", "https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/commit/80d80473abf71bd49bf6d3c1ab221e3c74e4eb83", "https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/commit/9917985de09a6cf38b3261faf9105e909d67a7d6", "https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v3.3.8", "https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/releases/tag/v4.22.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-21876"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1e3758b6-2355-38f9-a13f-dba6f91298d7", "product": {"name": "coreruleset"}, "product_version": "< 3.3.8"}, {"id": "7cef1fa2-2c2e-3315-a651-050ceac9c6dd", "product": {"name": "coreruleset"}, "product_version": "< 4.22.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75b00220-d65b-3204-b53d-593f027ef7fb", "vendor": {"name": "coreruleset"}}], "isExploited": false}
