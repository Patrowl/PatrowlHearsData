The vulnerability exists in the Media Manager's remote URL upload functionality (image.php) where the upload_caption parameter is not properly sanitized. An attacker with administrative privileges can use directory traversal sequences (../../../) in the upload_caption field to overwrite critical system files outside the intended upload directory. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application by overwriting configuration files, executable scripts, or other critical system components. The vulnerability was discovered by Hubert Wojciechowski and affects the image.php component in the admin interface.", "datePublished": "2026-01-13T22:52:03", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-14T19:18:51", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50939", "https://e107.org", "https://e107.org/download", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50910", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/e-cms-upload-restriction-bypass-with-path-traversal-file-override"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-50939", "GHSA-wj49-35g3-hmvr"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "33eabe9e-0232-301d-960d-6eb8d81beb98", "product": {"name": "e107 CMS"}, "product_version": "3.2.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa2168d7-3d33-3177-ab69-ab59fd9133be", "vendor": {"name": "e107"}}], "isExploited": false}
