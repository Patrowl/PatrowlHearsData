Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python\u2019s runpy module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses runpy.run_path() or runpy.run_module() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS. If a user relies on Fickling\u2019s output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system. This affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.", "datePublished": "2026-01-10T01:35:00", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-13T19:58:14", "baseScore": 8.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-565g-hwwr-4pp3", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-r7v6-mfhq-g3m2", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-wfq2-52f7-7qvj", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/108", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/187", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/195", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/9a2b3f89bd0598b528d62c10a64c1986fcb09f66", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/blob/977b0769c13537cd96549c12bb537f05464cf09c/test/test_bypasses.py#L87", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/releases/tag/v0.1.7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22606"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-22606", "GHSA-wfq2-52f7-7qvj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1d353e4d-f822-3a27-ba7a-c3e54472a28a", "product": {"name": "fickling"}, "product_version": "< 0.1.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c4868e60-3821-35ba-bc31-291b16a77fef", "vendor": {"name": "trailofbits"}}], "isExploited": false}
