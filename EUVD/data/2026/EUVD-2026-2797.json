This uncontrolled recursion vulnerability occurs in the xmlCatalogXMLResolveURI function when an XML catalog contains a delegate URI entry that references itself. A remote attacker could exploit this configuration-dependent issue by providing a specially crafted XML catalog, leading to infinite recursion and call stack exhaustion. This ultimately results in a segmentation fault, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing affected applications.", "datePublished": "2026-01-15T14:20:06", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-15T16:39:20", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0990", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2026-0990", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2429959"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-0990", "GHSA-2j3v-cxmf-cmp7"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d263293e-e54b-3621-bb42-c5b93b623c6f", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
