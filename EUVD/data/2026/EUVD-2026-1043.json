In versions 3.13.2 and below, handling of chunked messages can result in excessive blocking CPU usage when receiving a large number of chunks. If an application makes use of the request.read() method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.", "datePublished": "2026-01-05T23:37:52", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-06T19:02:09", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-g84x-mcqj-x9qq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-69229", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/4ed97a4e46eaf61bd0f05063245f613469700229", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/dc3170b56904bdf814228fae70a5501a42a6c712", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-69229", "GHSA-g84x-mcqj-x9qq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4430a1f-6c40-3c75-9569-e829c68d13b3", "product": {"name": "aiohttp"}, "product_version": "< 3.13.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "629f8e8f-e8c9-36c1-815f-bd18c3712305", "vendor": {"name": "aio-libs"}}], "isExploited": false}
