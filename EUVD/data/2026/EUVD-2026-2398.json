The vulnerability is caused by unsafe use of strcpy() and strcat() functions when constructing device paths during automatic device discovery. A local attacker can exploit this by creating specially crafted filenames under /dev/usb/, leading to stack memory corruption and application crashes.", "datePublished": "2026-01-12T23:02:45", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-13T19:06:27", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22212", "https://github.com/tinyos/tinyos-main", "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2026/Jan/14", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/tinyos-stack-based-buffer-overflow-in-mcp2200gpio"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-22212", "GHSA-x7h6-xxfr-j6pv"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "463f680c-9f48-3203-9ec2-394604902ec9", "product": {"name": "TinyOS"}, "product_version": "0 \u22642.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5476f650-d37f-3f72-8028-c0311d9f79f0", "vendor": {"name": "TinyOS"}}], "isExploited": false}
