While this does not lead to unintended modification of projects or tasks, it exposes users to Phishing attacks. Attackers can frame the legitimate Planka application on a malicious site to establish false trust (UI Redressing), potentially tricking users into entering sensitive information or credentials into overlaid fake forms. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because \"PLANKA uses SameSite=Strict cookies, preventing authentication in cross-origin contexts. No session can be established. No credential interception or unauthorized actions are possible. Browser Same-Origin Policy prevents the parent page from accessing iframe content. Clickjacking is not applicable on the login page. Any credential capture would require attacker-controlled input and user interaction equivalent to phishing. The security outcome depends entirely on the user's trust in the parent page. An attacker can achieve the same effect with a fully fake login page. Embedding the legitimate page adds no risk, as browsers do not show URL, certificate, or padlock indicators in cross-origin iframes.\"", "datePublished": "2026-01-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-05T21:35:02", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65922", "https://github.com/09OHs/CVE/blob/e67290bef68d35980d10fd87c9c4403d8e40fc2c/CVE-2025-65922/CVE-2025-65922.pdf", "https://github.com/plankanban/planka"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65922", "GHSA-rx3f-2wfj-p6wv"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "78103e85-6b62-30c7-8063-a3543e241d90", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2e68201e-c25f-36e0-a762-96ca52deb89c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
