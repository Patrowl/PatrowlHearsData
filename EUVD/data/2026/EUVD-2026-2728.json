Prior to 12.3.1 and 11.5.14, the application fails to enforce proper server-side authorization checks on the API endpoint responsible for reading or listing static routes. In Pimcore, static routes are custom URL patterns defined via the backend interface or the var/config/staticroutes.php file, including details like regex-based patterns, controllers, variables, and priorities. These routes are registered automatically through the PimcoreStaticRoutesBundle and integrated into the MVC routing system. Testing revealed that an authenticated backend user lacking explicit permissions was able to invoke the endpoint (e.g., GET /api/static-routes) and retrieve sensitive route configurations. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.1 and 11.5.14.", "datePublished": "2026-01-15T16:52:58", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-15T18:08:13", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-m3r2-724c-pwgf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-23494", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/18893", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/releases/tag/v11.5.14", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/releases/tag/v12.3.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-23494", "GHSA-m3r2-724c-pwgf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a853d171-db85-3b2e-97fc-82b0ffc04022", "product": {"name": "pimcore"}, "product_version": "< 11.5.14"}, {"id": "d6cb0f4c-c683-3c8c-986e-68b81c89c643", "product": {"name": "pimcore"}, "product_version": "12.0.0-RC1, < 12.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4aa6a951-c9f7-31aa-b5e4-65646f4ec3a3", "vendor": {"name": "pimcore"}}], "isExploited": false}
