This is due to missing nonce validation on the settings handler in dashboardbuilder-admin.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the stored SQL query and database credentials used by the [show-dashboardbuilder] shortcode via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The modified SQL query is subsequently executed on the front-end when the shortcode is rendered, enabling arbitrary SQL injection and data exfiltration through the publicly visible chart output.", "datePublished": "2026-01-14T05:28:03", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-14T19:17:25", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14615", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/tags/1.5.7/dashboardbuilder-admin.php#L158", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/tags/1.5.7/dashboardbuilder.php#L51", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/trunk/dashboardbuilder-admin.php#L158", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dashboard-builder/trunk/dashboardbuilder.php#L51", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/106b31ed-d509-4551-a134-02193ab22fe1?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14615", "GHSA-7cf2-rc28-965v"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b053a57-2396-3a0b-91b0-d0fdc5a68b8d", "product": {"name": "DASHBOARD BUILDER \u2013 WordPress plugin for Charts and Graphs"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.5.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "46466d43-971c-34a3-bb9b-2430ded0b3e0", "vendor": {"name": "dashboardbuilder"}}], "isExploited": false}
