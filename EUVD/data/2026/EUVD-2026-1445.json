This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result.\u00a0Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could\u2013under certain conditions\u2013derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.\n\nThis issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).", "datePublished": "2026-01-08T21:05:14", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-08T21:22:55", "baseScore": 5.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14505", "https://github.com/indutny/elliptic/issues/321", "https://www.herodevs.com/vulnerability-directory/cve-2025-14505"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14505", "GHSA-848j-6mx2-7j84"], "assigner": "HeroDevs", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "051cd5e3-9251-341f-8ff4-fb2b28dc2cc3", "product": {"name": "Elliptic"}, "product_version": "\u22646.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "91ec7366-9deb-379c-84c1-f8587e7f04a1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
