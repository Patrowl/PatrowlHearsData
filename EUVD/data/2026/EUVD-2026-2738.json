Prior to 1.13.0, Arcane has a command injection in the updater service. Arcane\u2019s updater service supported lifecycle labels com.getarcaneapp.arcane.lifecycle.pre-update and com.getarcaneapp.arcane.lifecycle.post-update that allowed defining a command to run before or after a container update. The label value is passed directly to /bin/sh -c without sanitization or validation. Because any authenticated user (not limited to administrators) can create projects through the API, an attacker can create a project that specifies one of these lifecycle labels with a malicious command. When an administrator later triggers a container update (either manually or via scheduled update checks), Arcane reads the lifecycle label and executes its value as a shell command inside the container. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.0.", "datePublished": "2026-01-15T19:20:22", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-15T19:58:45", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane/security/advisories/GHSA-gjqq-6r35-w3r8", "https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane/pull/1468", "https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane/commit/5a9c2f92e11f86f8997da8c672844468f930b7e4", "https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane", "https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane/releases/tag/v1.13.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-23520", "GHSA-gjqq-6r35-w3r8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "30a70659-caf4-3bc7-817c-818d7793ed62", "product": {"name": "Arcane"}, "product_version": "< 1.13.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5e58cf7-bfd9-3a83-a50b-ddf5bd2bcebd", "vendor": {"name": "getarcaneapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
