At the same\ntime, the code in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can\nbe generated, which is why it stores them in an int[2] array. However,\nas previously noted, the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly (and now UASM_i_LA)\ncauses a buffer overflow when _mcount is beyond 32 bits. This leads to\ncorruption of the variables located in the __read_mostly section.\n\nThis corruption was observed because the variable\n__cpu_primary_thread_mask was corrupted, causing a hang very early\nduring boot.\n\nThis fix prevents the corruption by avoiding the generation of\ninstructions if they could exceed 2 instructions in\nlength. Fortunately, insn_la_mcount is only used if the instrumented\ncode is located outside the kernel code section, so dynamic ftrace can\nstill be used, albeit in a more limited scope. This is still\npreferable to corrupting memory and/or crashing the kernel.", "datePublished": "2026-01-14T15:05:57", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-14T15:05:57", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-71109", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36dac9a3dda1f2bae343191bc16b910c603cac25", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f39b9d0e86ed6236b9a5fb67616ab1f76c4f150", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3e33ac2eb69d595079a1a1e444c2fb98efdd42d"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-71109", "GHSA-f8h3-qj6h-j2cj"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "26057ead-6568-3f57-ba1c-1b9c2a957797", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <e3e33ac2eb69d595079a1a1e444c2fb98efdd42d"}, {"id": "362eded4-ca5b-325e-a9be-929809bd321d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <36dac9a3dda1f2bae343191bc16b910c603cac25"}, {"id": "5fe48dd1-34a4-3bbe-885d-fc31f1242e56", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18.3"}, {"id": "9122eaf3-8989-3f27-a788-68015cd4d778", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.19-rc1"}, {"id": "b1fb3be2-1323-32a8-98a2-1203f1c72213", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.64"}, {"id": "bc284f51-3021-336c-87e3-3566d9c83c2e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <7f39b9d0e86ed6236b9a5fb67616ab1f76c4f150"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dcc0cad4-7b95-3f90-a356-ea1c591a58c1", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
