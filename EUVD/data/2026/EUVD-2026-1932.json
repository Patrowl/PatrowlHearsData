An attacker within RF range can transmit continuous interference to block sensor transmissions, resulting in missed alarms and loss of security monitoring. The device lacks jamming detection or mitigations, creating a denial-of-service condition that may lead to undetected intrusions or failure to trigger safety alerts.", "datePublished": "2026-01-12T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-12T14:58:59", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65553", "https://github.com/EmbdCDACHyd/CVE/tree/main/CVE-2025-65553", "http://d3d.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65553", "GHSA-xp8h-gc5h-wmff"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bf8d426f-23fd-384d-be38-3e6dbd2ab612", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d2a99540-95ea-3ef1-b701-c4c13db1d5f3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
