In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 PKE decryption path where an invalid elliptic-curve point (C1) is decoded and the resulting value is unwrapped without checking. Specifically, AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1) may return a None/CtOption::None when the supplied coordinates are syntactically valid but do not lie on the SM2 curve. The calling code previously used .unwrap(), causing a panic when presented with such input. This issue has been patched via commit 085b7be.", "datePublished": "2026-01-10T05:17:22", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-12T14:59:18", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/security/advisories/GHSA-78p6-6878-8mj6", "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/pull/1602", "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/085b7bee647029bd189e1375203418205006bcab", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22699"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-22699"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a16dcd38-22ec-3723-9231-5595876ca4a0", "product": {"name": "elliptic-curves"}, "product_version": "= 0.14.0-rc.0"}, {"id": "c76bb81b-f32b-332d-bb59-ccfe725a1e51", "product": {"name": "elliptic-curves"}, "product_version": "= 0.14.0-pre.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94cbd4d4-deb0-3219-a147-980f70bd8369", "vendor": {"name": "RustCrypto"}}], "isExploited": false}
