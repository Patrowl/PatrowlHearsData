During device detachment, the original implementation\ncalls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure\ncompletion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()\nin psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that\nwere already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any\nwork items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not\nincluded in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.\nThis means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,\nthe dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the\npsmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),\nthe scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)\npsmouse_disconnect()     |\n  psmouse_set_state()    |\n  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()\n  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()\n    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()\n                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE\n                         |   priv->dev3 // USE\n\nAdd disable_delayed_work_sync() in alps_disconnect() to ensure\nthat dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from\nexecuting after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.\n\nThis bug is identified by static analysis.", "datePublished": "2026-01-13T15:29:24", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-13T15:29:24", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68822", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9c115e017b2c633d25bdfe6709dda6fc36f08c2", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bf40644ef8c8a288742fa45580897ed0e0289474", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed8c61b89be0c45f029228b2913d5cf7b5cda1a7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-68822", "GHSA-5w2m-pcx5-5834"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f79acc4-1174-308e-8847-2979c3084436", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.19-rc2"}, {"id": "74f06ed2-df73-3f0a-ace4-e8d897c15b72", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18.3"}, {"id": "a56178c1-9198-36cf-81f8-10f2eecd982b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "4.0"}, {"id": "b032dcf9-6853-365a-ab9c-da8c6f23f732", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "04aae283ba6a8cd4851d937bf9c6d6ef0361d794 <ed8c61b89be0c45f029228b2913d5cf7b5cda1a7"}, {"id": "b0a75fb2-42a6-3255-be12-b1ad36050d32", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "04aae283ba6a8cd4851d937bf9c6d6ef0361d794 <a9c115e017b2c633d25bdfe6709dda6fc36f08c2"}, {"id": "c2beb2cc-2fe3-334c-a574-a23b57ba681f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.64"}, {"id": "eba633a1-81ed-3749-8da5-dad34afe3f03", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "04aae283ba6a8cd4851d937bf9c6d6ef0361d794 <bf40644ef8c8a288742fa45580897ed0e0289474"}, {"id": "f22fc388-cbe8-3cc2-b47c-021a7ce462c4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af70e255-c983-3566-9d4c-4a6a2c7aad25", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
