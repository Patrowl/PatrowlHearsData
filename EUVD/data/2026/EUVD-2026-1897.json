Prior to version 1.4.3, the Crypto_Config_Add_Gvcid_Managed_Parameters function only checks whether gvcid_counter > GVCID_MAN_PARAM_SIZE. As a result, it allows up to the 251st entry, which causes a write past the end of the array, overwriting gvcid_counter located immediately after gvcid_managed_parameters_array[250]. This leads to an out-of-bounds write, and the overwritten gvcid_counter may become an arbitrary value, potentially affecting the parameter lookup/registration logic that relies on it. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.", "datePublished": "2026-01-10T00:07:16", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-12T20:21:22", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-9x7j-gx23-7m5r", "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/releases/tag/v1.4.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-21897"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2e5ec01-f103-31d3-bca2-b2488fa5e003", "product": {"name": "CryptoLib"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7d400ebc-ebd9-3c25-9e64-ab8db5f2f92e", "vendor": {"name": "NASA"}}], "isExploited": false}
