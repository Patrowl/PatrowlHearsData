Prior to version 6.6.0, pypdf has possible long runtimes for missing /Root object with large /Size values. An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to possibly long runtimes for actually invalid files. This can be achieved by omitting the /Root entry in the trailer, while using a rather large /Size value. Only the non-strict reading mode is affected.
