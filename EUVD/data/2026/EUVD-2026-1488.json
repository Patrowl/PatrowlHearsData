In certain cases, it displays signer information from a non-verified PDF field rather than from the verified certificate subject. This could allow a document to present inconsistent signer details. The display logic was updated to ensure signer information consistently reflects the verified certificate identity.", "datePublished": "2026-01-08T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-08T17:09:19", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67825", "https://gonitro.com", "https://www.gonitro.com/documentation/release-notes"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-67825", "GHSA-r4j5-j8m6-jr6p"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ecaa6436-ae26-3d25-948f-b64f01cf036f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fe550225-aea9-3307-aded-2352f95fa249", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
