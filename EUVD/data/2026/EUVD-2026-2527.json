This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'set_stopwords_for_comments' and 'delete_stopwords_for_comments' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or delete stopwords via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2026-01-14T06:40:08", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-14T19:13:00", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-15376", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/stopwords-for-comments/trunk/functions.php?marks=151,170#L151", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/dd8c45c7-dbb2-46ab-8e50-e02062587b00?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-15376", "GHSA-9hx9-v7r8-39wm"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d84fc496-9628-3224-9b93-eeb65ab5b84e", "product": {"name": "Stopwords for comments"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f6a62690-0e43-3700-8f56-4d4a9c683a23", "vendor": {"name": "rndsand81"}}], "isExploited": false}
