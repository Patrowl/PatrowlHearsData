This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2026-01-06T04:31:57", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-06T14:57:03", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14997", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bp-xprofile-custom-field-types/tags/1.2.8/src/handlers/class-field-upload-helper.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3430565/bp-xprofile-custom-field-types", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/89a7a717-dac3-490e-89dd-268be8eb7bf5?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14997", "GHSA-6qr6-x63g-2597"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c57a989-d118-31f2-abf5-073873fa274b", "product": {"name": "BuddyPress Xprofile Custom Field Types"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2f35790-220e-3a7d-af08-c3697e37d00c", "vendor": {"name": "buddydev"}}], "isExploited": false}
