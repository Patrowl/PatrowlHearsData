In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a  critical vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE) implementation where the ephemeral nonce k is generated with severely reduced entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce k and decrypt any ciphertext given only the public key and ciphertext. This issue has been patched via commit e4f7778.", "datePublished": "2026-01-10T05:17:19", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-12T16:48:30", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/security/advisories/GHSA-w3g8-fp6j-wvqw", "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/pull/1600", "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/4781762f23ff22ab34763410f648128055c93731", "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/e4f77788130d065d760e57fb109370827110a525", "https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-pre.0", "https://crates.io/crates/sm2/0.14.0-rc.0", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22698"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-22698"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a647fb61-0c7f-33e5-9226-eb50bf8618c0", "product": {"name": "elliptic-curves"}, "product_version": "= 0.14.0-rc.0"}, {"id": "c54f73ba-fc76-32d2-84b8-47e43c2c49ee", "product": {"name": "elliptic-curves"}, "product_version": "= 0.14.0-pre.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aefeecf3-b267-301a-81c9-0e77a949d974", "vendor": {"name": "RustCrypto"}}], "isExploited": false}
