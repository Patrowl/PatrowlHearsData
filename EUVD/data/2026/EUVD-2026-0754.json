Versions up to and including 2.5.19 are vulnerable to server-side Out-of-Band (OOB) requests / SSRF via uploaded SVG files. An attacker can upload a crafted SVG to http[:]//emblog/admin/media[.]php which contains external resource references. When the server processes/renders the SVG (thumbnailing, preview, or sanitization), it issues an HTTP request to the attacker-controlled host. Impact: server-side SSRF/OOB leading to internal network probing and potential metadata/credential exposure. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "datePublished": "2026-01-02T19:00:22", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-05T20:37:52", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories/GHSA-6rwr-c8hc-mjj4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-21433"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4388dcfe-7733-3b9a-bed2-9c546614dc1d", "product": {"name": "emlog"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.5.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d248c1f1-191d-3144-bdb5-676ecc49bd57", "vendor": {"name": "emlog"}}], "isExploited": false}
