This is due to the plugin trusting user-supplied headers such as HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to determine the client's IP address without proper validation or considering if the server is behind a trusted proxy. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass IP-based access restrictions by spoofing their IP address via the X-Forwarded-For header.", "datePublished": "2026-01-07T09:20:51", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-07T16:12:08", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13694", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/aa-block-country/tags/1.0.1/aablockcountry.php#L26", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/aa-block-country/trunk/aablockcountry.php#L26", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/037ac32a-dc2e-4e9f-9318-65dfee1c80e9?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13694", "GHSA-3jqj-jp4r-6xwm"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "adacdcc3-4721-37e9-906a-c61684fd019d", "product": {"name": "AA Block country"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fbad3e38-fdbd-359c-b9b5-9f80bb49ff79", "vendor": {"name": "aaextensions"}}], "isExploited": false}
