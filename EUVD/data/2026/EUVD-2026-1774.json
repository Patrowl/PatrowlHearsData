This is due to insufficient sanitization of SVG file content that only removes `<script>` tags while allowing other XSS vectors such as event handlers (onload, onerror, onmouseover), foreignObject elements, and SVG animation attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts via malicious SVG file uploads that will execute whenever a user views the uploaded file.", "datePublished": "2026-01-09T08:20:46", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-09T18:03:30", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-0627", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/accelerated-mobile-pages/tags/1.1.10/templates/features.php#L10373", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/accelerated-mobile-pages/trunk/templates/features.php#L10373", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3434946/accelerated-mobile-pages/trunk/templates/features.php?old=3426181&old_path=accelerated-mobile-pages%2Ftrunk%2Ftemplates%2Ffeatures.php", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4ed23318-3b47-4336-a3aa-6b09f3911926?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-0627", "GHSA-xqjx-hmf9-wj9v"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4f0e0965-8ff6-3152-8248-363b9a4c4b70", "product": {"name": "AMP for WP \u2013 Accelerated Mobile Pages"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9d0c1c99-8d4f-3ffa-8b29-d643c489baf1", "vendor": {"name": "mohammed_kaludi"}}], "isExploited": false}
