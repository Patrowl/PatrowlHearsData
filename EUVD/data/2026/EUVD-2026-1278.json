This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with customer-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. While it is possible to invoke the AJAX action without authentication, the attacker would need to know a valid form ID, which requires them to place an order. This vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers if guest checkout is enabled. However, the form ID still needs to be obtained through placing an order.", "datePublished": "2026-01-07T03:21:03", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-07T16:14:55", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14891", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/customer-reviews-woocommerce/trunk/includes/reminders/class-cr-local-forms-ajax.php#L76", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/customer-reviews-woocommerce/trunk/templates/form-customer.php#L19", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3424980/customer-reviews-woocommerce", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/88e4eec2-2861-4d1d-97eb-67887f59c745?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14891", "GHSA-f53f-v4m9-rh4j"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fa34d1d4-3b85-3559-bff8-6a02fd29fecc", "product": {"name": "Customer Reviews for WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.93.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d2c37a4-9654-31c6-9a92-65e33130098f", "vendor": {"name": "ivole"}}], "isExploited": false}
