From 1.7.0 to 1.9.0, Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Termix File Manager component. The application fails to sanitize SVG file content before rendering it. This allows an attacker who has compromised a managed SSH server to plant a malicious file, which, when previewed by the Termix user, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application. The vulnerability is located in src/ui/desktop/apps/file-manager/components/FileViewer.tsx.
