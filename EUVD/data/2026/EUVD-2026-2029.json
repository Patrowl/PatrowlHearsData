From 1.36.0 to before 2.2.0, the Webhook node\u2019s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring. This issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.0.", "datePublished": "2026-01-13T18:43:20", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-13T19:00:47", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-w96v-gf22-crwp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68949", "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/23399", "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/23399", "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/11f8597d4ad69ea3b58941573997fdbc4de1fec5", "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-68949", "GHSA-w96v-gf22-crwp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dd7ddb5a-851a-3ff7-82f3-3761189236ce", "product": {"name": "n8n"}, "product_version": "1.36.0, < 2.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dd8fee09-25a0-393b-9dfd-a07000fb2290", "vendor": {"name": "n8n-io"}}], "isExploited": false}
