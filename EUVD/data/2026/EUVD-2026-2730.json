Prior to 1.9.2, DPanel has an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in the /api/common/attach/delete interface. Authenticated users can delete arbitrary files on the server via path traversal. When a user logs into the administrative backend, this interface can be used to delete files. The vulnerability lies in the Delete function within the app/common/http/controller/attach.go file. The path parameter submitted by the user is directly passed to storage.Local{}.GetSaveRealPath and subsequently to os.Remove without proper sanitization or checking for path traversal characters (../). And the helper function in common/service/storage/local.go uses filepath.Join, which resolves ../ but does not enforce a chroot/jail. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.9.2.", "datePublished": "2026-01-15T16:19:55", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-15T16:44:51", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/security/advisories/GHSA-vh2x-fw87-4fxq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-66292", "https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/commit/cbda0d90204e8212f2010774345c952e42069119", "https://github.com/donknap/dpanel", "https://github.com/donknap/dpanel/releases/tag/v1.9.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-66292", "GHSA-vh2x-fw87-4fxq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "98c223d2-dfbb-3243-8d2a-1aed3972b741", "product": {"name": "dpanel"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "82df5a6e-b92c-3761-9c30-33f5ced5155a", "vendor": {"name": "donknap"}}], "isExploited": false}
