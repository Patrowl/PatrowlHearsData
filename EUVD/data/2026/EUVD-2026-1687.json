Fickling versions up to and including 0.1.6 do not treat Python's cProfile module as unsafe. Because of this, a malicious pickle that uses cProfile.run() is classified as SUSPICIOUS instead of OVERTLY_MALICIOUS. If a user relies on Fickling's output to decide whether a pickle is safe to deserialize, this misclassification can lead them to execute attacker-controlled code on their system. This affects any workflow or product that uses Fickling as a security gate for pickle deserialization. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.7.", "datePublished": "2026-01-10T01:35:04", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-13T21:49:38", "baseScore": 8.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-565g-hwwr-4pp3", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-p523-jq9w-64x9", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/security/advisories/GHSA-r7v6-mfhq-g3m2", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/108", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/187", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/pull/195", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/commit/dc8ae12966edee27a78fe05c5745171a2b138d43", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/blob/977b0769c13537cd96549c12bb537f05464cf09c/test/test_bypasses.py#L116", "https://github.com/trailofbits/fickling/releases/tag/v0.1.7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-22607"], "aliases": ["CVE-2026-22607", "GHSA-p523-jq9w-64x9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3f75970b-51a1-3de2-a113-2ac73cfee20d", "product": {"name": "fickling"}, "product_version": "< 0.1.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39807eaa-8237-36f5-be37-d1ca4b3f8128", "vendor": {"name": "trailofbits"}}], "isExploited": false}
