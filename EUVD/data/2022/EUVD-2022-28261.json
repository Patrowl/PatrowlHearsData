Any SysAid environment that uses the Okta SSO integration might be vulnerable. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the XXE vulnerability by sending a malformed POST request to the identity provider endpoint. An attacker can extract the identity provider endpoint by decoding the SAMLRequest parameter's value and searching for the AssertionConsumerServiceURL parameter's value. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem and interact with any back-end or external systems that the application can access. In some situations, an attacker can escalate an XXE attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure by leveraging the XXE vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.", "datePublished": "2022-06-24T15:00:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:24:37", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.gov.il/en/departments/faq/cve_advisories"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23170"], "assigner": "INCD", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "76701db8-a096-3ce8-8857-952c78e7bc9d", "product": {"name": "SysAid - Okta SSO integration"}, "product_version": "22.1.63 <22.1.49*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c5329b02-ba6d-3c8a-a124-c43116ef41d7", "vendor": {"name": "SysAid"}}], "isExploited": false}
