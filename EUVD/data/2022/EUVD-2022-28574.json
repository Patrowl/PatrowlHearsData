Among these cogs is the Defender cog, a tool for Discord server moderation. A vulnerability in the Defender cog prior to version 1.10.0 allows users with admin privileges to issue commands as other users who share the same server. If a bot owner shares the same server as the attacker, it is possible for the attacker to issue bot-owner restricted commands. The issue has been patched in version 1.10.0. One may unload the Defender cog as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-02-15T15:40:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:05:10", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/security/advisories/GHSA-cfh8-v56j-5757", "https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/commit/72dd9323cb4c90f3a5accac7087605375d178246", "https://github.com/Twentysix26/x26-Cogs/releases/tag/v1.10"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23604"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a84f21ff-d618-38a9-ad58-63c4c2e0169f", "product": {"name": "x26-Cogs"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67b5646f-ceca-3854-83e9-df22dfb6ad62", "vendor": {"name": "Twentysix26"}}], "isExploited": false}
