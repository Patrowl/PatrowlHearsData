This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or delete specific files on the device that their configured administrative level should not have access to. Cisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-10-26T14:00:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-15T15:59:22", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-path-trav-Dz5dpzyM", "https://yoroi.company/en/research/cve-advisory-full-disclosure-cisco-ise-path-traversal/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20822"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6de573d3-3c83-371f-ae84-d320fdfb1fdc", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3aae4e1b-11ae-3bbe-86f5-212f777ba81f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
