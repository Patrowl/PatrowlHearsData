In versions prior to 1.12.0 a number of vulnerabilities have been found in cosign verify-blob, where Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification should have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference the given signature. Second, when providing identity flags, the email and issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle, and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked. Third, providing an invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag results in a successful verification. And fourth an invalid transparency log entry will result in immediate success for verification. Details and examples of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388 advisory linked. Users are advised to upgrade to 1.12.0. There are no known workarounds for these issues.", "datePublished": "2022-09-14T19:50:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:21:40", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36056", "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/80b79ed8b4d28ccbce3d279fd273606b5cddcc25", "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign", "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/tag/v1.12.0", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8827", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-36056.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36056", "GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ae18d9b3-4086-324b-9cd2-b4a4f3d61926", "product": {"name": "cosign"}, "product_version": "< 1.12.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3f46f95-1de6-3ca1-8ad0-c40791ad5f3c", "vendor": {"name": "sigstore"}}], "isExploited": false}
