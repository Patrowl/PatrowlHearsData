A remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in Autolab's MOSS functionality, whereby an instructor with access to the feature might be able to execute code on the server hosting Autolab. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.10.0. As a workaround, disable the MOSS feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of `run_moss` in `app/controllers/courses_controller.rb` with `render(plain: \"Feature disabled\", status: :bad_request) && return`.", "datePublished": "2023-01-14T00:09:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T12:56:38", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-x5r3-vf3p-3269", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-100_Autolab/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41955"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5dd5c9d1-4848-3720-aa1a-4e2ea3c27ba5", "product": {"name": "Autolab"}, "product_version": "2.0.1, \u2264 2.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f34b2fc8-8c78-3519-bfd8-508e4ff15953", "vendor": {"name": "autolab"}}], "isExploited": false}
