Since Metasploit Framework typically runs with elevated privileges, this can lead to a system compromise on the Metasploit workstation. Note that an attacker would have to lie in wait and entice the Metasploit user to run the affected module against a malicious endpoint in a \"hack-back\" type of attack. Metasploit is only vulnerable when the drb_remote_codeexec module is running. In most cases, this cannot happen automatically.", "datePublished": "2021-04-23T15:35:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:30:50", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7385", "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/14300", "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/14335", "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework", "https://help.rapid7.com/metasploit/release-notes/archive/2020/10", "https://help.rapid7.com/metasploit/release-notes/archive/2020/10/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-7385", "GHSA-xgww-h98f-24qf"], "assigner": "rapid7", "epss": 0.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "470534e7-7b3e-337c-a016-e68c015ffea7", "product": {"name": "Metasploit Framework"}, "product_version": "6.0.15 \u22646.0.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "88701e57-9efc-3b84-854e-e02fe0c5f606", "vendor": {"name": "Rapid7"}}], "isExploited": false}
