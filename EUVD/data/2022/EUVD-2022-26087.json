This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an affected device inspects certain TCP DNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through the affected device that is performing NAT for DNS packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only by sending IPv4 TCP packets through an affected device. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 traffic.", "datePublished": "2022-10-10T20:43:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:49:14", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-alg-dos-KU9Z8kFX"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20837"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4f1e2ada-d706-3cfe-9544-b7c8940c04d8", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d0c5a718-3071-3343-8b61-0c883443671b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
