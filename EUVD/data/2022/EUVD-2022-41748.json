In versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.6 a polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm's autolink extension may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. Users may verify the patch by running `python3 -c 'print(\"![l\"* 100000 + \"\\n\")' | ./cmark-gfm -e autolink`, which will resource exhaust on unpatched cmark-gfm but render correctly on patched cmark-gfm. This vulnerability has been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the use of the autolink extension.", "datePublished": "2022-09-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:10:11", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-cgh3-p57x-9q7q", "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/9d57d8a23142b316282bdfc954cb0ecda40a8655", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMGP65NANDVKPDMXMKYO2ZV2H2HZJY4P/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JIUCZN3PEKUCT2JQYQTYOVIJG2KSD6G7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UEAAAI4OULDYQ2TA3HOXH54PC3DCBFZS/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMGP65NANDVKPDMXMKYO2ZV2H2HZJY4P/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JIUCZN3PEKUCT2JQYQTYOVIJG2KSD6G7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UEAAAI4OULDYQ2TA3HOXH54PC3DCBFZS/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39209"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "629cf0f4-eae5-3e80-8ddb-7293421d2f9c", "product": {"name": "cmark-gfm"}, "product_version": "< 0.29.0.gfm.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a12a8c38-59f6-3e09-b602-575681a8e495", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
