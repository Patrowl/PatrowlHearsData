In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-02-22T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:34", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-ffff-m5fm-qm62", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/1", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166226/Asterisk-Project-Security-Advisory-AST-2022-005.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00040.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23608"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "52e47428-e07c-37ac-8156-4f2021ed917f", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "64c63f0a-2ac8-3efe-8322-d9dc29014f1b", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
