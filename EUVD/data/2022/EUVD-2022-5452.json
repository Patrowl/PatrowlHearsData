The ability to exploit this vulnerability depends on the availability of classes in the class path that make use of deserialization. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control information may be able to send serialized Java objects with pre-set properties that result in arbitrary code execution when deserialized.", "datePublished": "2018-06-11T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T14:16:28", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-3200", "https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html", "https://github.com/graniteds/graniteds", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124021547/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97382", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307983", "http://www.securityweek.com/flaws-java-amf-libraries-allow-remote-code-execution"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-3200", "GHSA-vx9j-rvmj-jc32"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 14.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "592dc03d-feeb-320c-85a9-3708c73b061b", "product": {"name": "framework"}, "product_version": "3.1.1.G"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fabd7f85-bcb3-3f8d-a8a4-3420a8949fa6", "vendor": {"name": "GraniteDS"}}], "isExploited": false}
