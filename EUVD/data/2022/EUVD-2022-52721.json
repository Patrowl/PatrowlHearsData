Starting with version RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z, MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing MinIO deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting connections from such malicious clients.", "datePublished": "2022-06-03T14:40:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:55:05", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-qrpr-r3pw-f636", "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/14995", "https://gist.github.com/harshavardhana/2d00e6f909054d2d2524c71485ad02e1", "https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2022-06-03T01-40-53Z"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31028"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "772df0a4-251d-3afe-ab6a-99c6b41b4406", "product": {"name": "minio"}, "product_version": "RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z, < RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39f0a0a8-3f95-319c-af5e-1886a6c5e577", "vendor": {"name": "minio"}}], "isExploited": false}
