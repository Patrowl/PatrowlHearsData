Versions starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "datePublished": "2022-06-01T22:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:20:31", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-rwrv-p665-4vwp", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14886", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14896"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29169"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.65, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "80dea450-d710-3ce4-9aec-fb0006d99072", "product": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}, "product_version": "2.2, < 2.3.19"}, {"id": "a5041783-a26e-3f36-a71e-041d350de7fe", "product": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}, "product_version": "2.5-alpha-1, < 2.5.0-beta.2"}, {"id": "c3a27abd-5c5b-3f5b-9a04-f95f4a292f6c", "product": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}, "product_version": "2.4.0, < 2.4.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4c37c33d-a217-3439-ba31-83afc931ac6f", "vendor": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}}], "isExploited": false}
