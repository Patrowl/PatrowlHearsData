Some of these checks are able to be bypassed if an account modification re-adds an SPN that was previously present on that account, such as one added when a computer is joined to a domain. An attacker who has the ability to write to an account can exploit this to perform a denial-of-service attack by adding an SPN that matches an existing service. Additionally, an attacker who can intercept traffic can impersonate existing services, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity.", "datePublished": "2022-08-29T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T23:25:40", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0336.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5071", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-0336", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-0336.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2022-0336", "https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2022-0336.html", "https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14950", "https://github.com/samba-team/samba/commit/1a5dc817c0c9379bbaab14c676681b42b0039a3c", "https://github.com/samba-team/samba/commit/c58ede44f382bd0125f761f0479c8d48156be400", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2046134", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0336", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202309-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-0336"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b6319de-c8ef-3378-b2cd-17bc9f4b48e3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
