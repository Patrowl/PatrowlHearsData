This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as the root user through the id HTTP POST parameter in the res.php endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the root privileges. NOTE: The vendor has stated that with the introduction of firmware version 1.49.16 (Jan 2023) the FLIR AX8 should no longer be affected by the vulnerability reported. Latest firmware version (as of Oct 2025, was released Jun 2024) is 1.55.16.", "datePublished": "2022-08-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-17T19:18:34", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.flir.com/products/ax8-automation/", "https://gist.github.com/Nwqda/9e16852ab7827dc62b8e44d6180a6899", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168114/FLIX-AX8-1.46.16-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168116/FLIR-AX8-1.46.16-Traversal-Access-Control-Command-Injection-XSS.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169701/FLIR-AX8-1.46.16-Remote-Command-Injection.html", "https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2018-5491.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-37061", "https://github.com/WlX-33/PoC-for-CVE/blob/main/CVE-2022-36266/FLIR%20AX8%20Unauthenticated%20OS%20Command%20Injection.py"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-37061"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 93.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "df284c51-4328-3ed2-b60a-2b162b46549f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2adf2bf-9076-37b8-8f16-bbd98b305702", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
