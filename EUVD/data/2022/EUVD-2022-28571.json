Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a remote program execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link, followed by another button click. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element Desktop < 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to specify a file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then gets executed. Notably, the attacker does *not* have the ability to specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified configurations, the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of a file path which then gets handled using standard platform mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities in those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.", "datePublished": "2022-02-01T11:49:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T03:43:46", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23597.html", "https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/security/advisories/GHSA-mjrg-9f8r-h3m7", "https://github.com/vector-im/element-desktop/commit/89b1e39b801655e595337708d4319ba4313feafa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23597"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5081f172-3f26-33e3-b8ec-edd3a3faea25", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e23c3a9-7e33-392a-a36d-724f20dc0fe5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
