Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2 clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket (more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2 handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session cache frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the client to crash with a \"free(): invalid pointer\" message. NOTE: It is likely that this is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between a client and a malicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to exploit this as a man-in-the-middle.", "datePublished": "2022-08-31T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T10:45:52", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases", "https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/", "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/5476", "https://github.com/trailofbits/tlspuffin", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170605/wolfSSL-5.3.0-Denial-Of-Service.html", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-38153"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "76713ff4-2767-3f70-a7b9-26da9527fcba", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e75f8e88-917b-35b6-bb29-c7310e215adb", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
