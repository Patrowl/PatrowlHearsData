This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user privileges after the user executes certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device as a low-privileged user and then executing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with level 15 privileges on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:16:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:14:46", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewlc-priv-esc-ybvHKO5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20681"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58e34304-2a3b-3ec8-b1ef-35976eb4c8f5", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f0b112e1-343d-330c-b83f-3f3e0820eef9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
