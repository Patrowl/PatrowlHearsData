Prior to version 1.9.7, events encrypted using Megolm for which trust could not be established did not get decorated accordingly (with warning shields). Therefore a malicious homeserver could inject messages into the room without the user being alerted that the messages were not sent by a verified group member, even if the user has previously verified all group members. This issue has been patched in Element iOS 1.9.7. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-11-11T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:37:58", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/security/advisories/GHSA-fm8m-99j7-323g", "https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/releases/tag/v1.9.7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41904"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5fab7a43-4eaa-3878-ac45-63006e947c2c", "product": {"name": "element-ios"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6295f50b-fa2c-31d3-8f38-2caa533255fb", "vendor": {"name": "vector-im"}}], "isExploited": false}
