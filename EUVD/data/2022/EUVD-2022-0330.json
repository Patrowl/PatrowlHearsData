A malicious user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that `TensorByteSize` would trigger `CHECK` failures. `TensorShape` constructor throws a `CHECK`-fail if shape is partial or has a number of elements that would overflow the size of an `int`. The `PartialTensorShape` constructor instead does not cause a `CHECK`-abort if the shape is partial, which is exactly what this function needs to be able to return `-1`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "datePublished": "2022-02-04T22:32:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:26:15", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-4j82-5ccr-4r8v", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c2426bba00a01de6913738df8fa78e0215fcce02", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc#L46-L50", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23582", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2022-91.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2022-146.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23582.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23582", "GHSA-4j82-5ccr-4r8v", "PYSEC-2022-91"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03a3d745-16e5-3e73-a320-5274925bd6dc", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.7.0, < 2.7.1"}, {"id": "2c2fbd4c-00a7-381a-b360-9c9774f9fcdb", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.6.0, < 2.6.3"}, {"id": "418e06ea-0002-38a2-9ef4-c112cd4995c4", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b6db5d4-57eb-3e5f-8615-cb99da060622", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
