This vulnerability is due to how the decryption function uses the TLS Sever Name Indication (SNI) extension of an HTTP request to discover the destination domain and determine if the request needs to be decrypted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request over TLS from a client to an unknown or controlled URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the decryption process of Cisco Umbrella SWG and allow malicious content to be downloaded to a host on a protected network. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-04-21T18:51:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:21:48", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uswg-fdbps-xtTRKpp6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20805"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5bfe832c-69d3-3224-b91f-a05d471dfd59", "product": {"name": "Cisco Umbrella Insights Virtual Appliance"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8fb4f98d-ba62-332e-af7c-165f9098ce2c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
