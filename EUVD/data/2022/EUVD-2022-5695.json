The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).", "datePublished": "2018-06-21T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T08:38:06", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-12613", "https://github.com/phpmyadmin/composer", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-16", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44924", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44928", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45020", "https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-4", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164623/phpMyAdmin-4.8.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104532", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-12613.html", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-12613", "https://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-4/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45020/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44924/", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44928/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-12613", "GHSA-x394-g9j8-x7mf"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 94.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "68e6b46d-1c1a-3341-99dd-12289f3fcc29", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "146638de-b3ef-3a60-928a-2bff46a24fa6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
