{"id": "EUVD-2022-1866", "enisaUuid": "15bb5fc1-b317-3b1f-8ffa-24c649c252f9", "description": "Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language. Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent` can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the `$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the `$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into `$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.", "datePublished": "2022-04-13T21:00:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:40:09", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24828", "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/2c40c53637c5c7e43fff7c09d3d324d632734709", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/composer/composer/CVE-2022-24828.yaml", "https://github.com/composer/composer", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/625MT3IKWKFVIWLSYZFSXHVUA2LES7YQ", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWT6LDSRY7SFMTDZWJ4MS2ZBXHL7VQEF", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QD7JQWL6C4GVROO25DTXWYWM6BPOPPCG", "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2022-09", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-24828.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QD7JQWL6C4GVROO25DTXWYWM6BPOPPCG/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWT6LDSRY7SFMTDZWJ4MS2ZBXHL7VQEF/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/625MT3IKWKFVIWLSYZFSXHVUA2LES7YQ/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24828", "GHSA-x7cr-6qr6-2hh6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5420ddf0-e0ad-338b-aa56-388d19fd4f95", "product": {"name": "composer"}, "product_version": "2.3, < 2.3.6"}, {"id": "69f2e03b-68e6-3332-ba0b-9dfa3346c004", "product": {"name": "composer"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.2.12"}, {"id": "825ffb2d-e9f5-3cef-b2ea-a745da80bf6b", "product": {"name": "composer"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.26"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ae3eb95-d154-315c-9765-041b2fbd8dcc", "vendor": {"name": "composer"}}], "isExploited": false}
