They allow for custom application installation via either STS software, the C toolkit, or the ACE1000 Easy Configurator. In the case of the Easy Configurator, application images (as PLX/DAT/APP/CRC files) are uploaded via the Web UI. In case of the C toolkit, they are transferred and installed using SFTP/SSH. In each case, application images were found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.", "datePublished": "2022-07-26T22:11:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:48:34", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-30269"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "00ff4996-41a6-3522-a2f7-647f76c3e859", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f8e4caf-eaad-3206-8978-cc85c6de4449", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
