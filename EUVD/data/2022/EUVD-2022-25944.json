{"id": "EUVD-2022-25944", "enisaUuid": "3d7bb2f7-8cc4-3baa-b099-870eb7942679", "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) process to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a specific RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to an affected device. Alternatively, the attacker could use man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate the RPKI validator server and send a crafted RTR response packet over the established RTR TCP connection to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart and BGP routing could become unstable.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:15:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:26:43", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-rpki-dos-2EgCNeKE"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20694"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "514974cc-fef6-3775-8c15-92012444c84e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b139ed5b-c28b-3590-960f-f113f6acb0d9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
