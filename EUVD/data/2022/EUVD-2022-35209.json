The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-08-25T17:24:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:53:00", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2991.html", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-960/", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/drivers/lightnvm/Kconfig?h=v5.10.114&id=549209caabc89f2877ad5f62d11fca5c052e0e8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2991"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5735c7bc-d25d-36e4-93cd-fcac0bbac3aa", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
