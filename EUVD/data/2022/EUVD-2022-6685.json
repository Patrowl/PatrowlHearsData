Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-09-13T16:55:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:11:55", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-47m6-46mj-p235", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36020", "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/60bfdc7f9b394d0236e16ee4cea8372a7defa493", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms-core/CVE-2022-36020.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/cms/CVE-2022-36020.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/typo3/html-sanitizer/CVE-2022-36020.yaml", "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer", "https://packagist.org/packages/masterminds/html5", "https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-011"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36020", "GHSA-47m6-46mj-p235"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ab0b615-07aa-339a-bbb4-e2b0056ea2f8", "product": {"name": "html-sanitizer"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.0.16"}, {"id": "f3310824-855b-36e6-a095-41851661a9c3", "product": {"name": "html-sanitizer"}, "product_version": "1.0.0, < 1.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "35196988-9c95-3710-a5c2-b67a0b86f090", "vendor": {"name": "TYPO3"}}], "isExploited": false}
