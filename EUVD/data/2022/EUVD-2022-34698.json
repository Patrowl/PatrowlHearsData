This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.", "datePublished": "2022-07-18T16:13:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:39:06", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/50bcea94-b12a-4b31-b0c1-bba834ea9bd0?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2754749%40feed-them-social&new=2754749%40feed-them-social&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2437"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2437"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 9.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d5d6f3bb-c761-3cb4-898c-b95f0864a4f7", "product": {"name": "Feed Them Social \u2013 Page, Post, Video, and Photo Galleries"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.9.8.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "33c4cf49-df41-3ad1-82ed-8d6219b9fc4d", "vendor": {"name": "slickremix"}}], "isExploited": false}
