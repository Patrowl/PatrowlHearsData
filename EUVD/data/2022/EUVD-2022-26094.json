This vulnerability exists because the GUI is accessible on self-managed cloud installations or local server installations of Cisco vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the exposed GUI of Cisco SD-AVC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view managed device names, SD-AVC logs, and SD-AVC DNS server IP addresses.", "datePublished": "2022-09-30T18:45:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:51:11", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdavc-ZA5fpXX2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20844"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "87777af2-e604-35ea-98d6-6904f4c321e7", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "60b967b4-4d50-37cf-b15e-a0e648c5b30f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
