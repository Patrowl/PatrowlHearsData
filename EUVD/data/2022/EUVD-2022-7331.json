A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`.", "datePublished": "2022-11-02T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:41:33", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/security/advisories/GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39379", "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/commit/48e5b85dab1b6d4c273090d538fc11b3f2fd8135", "https://github.com/fluent/fluentd", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/fluentd/CVE-2022-39379.yml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYD5QV66OLDHES6IKVYYM3Y3YID3VVCO", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYD5QV66OLDHES6IKVYYM3Y3YID3VVCO/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYD5QV66OLDHES6IKVYYM3Y3YID3VVCO/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39379", "GHSA-fppq-mj76-fpj2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 6.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ba1535a-fca6-3921-807b-0b6da5652bb3", "product": {"name": "Fluentd"}, "product_version": "1.13.2, < 1.15.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e38083d6-a6de-3ff4-a31c-83d06c8cc01b", "vendor": {"name": "fluent"}}], "isExploited": false}
