To exploit the vulnerability: 1) the attacker needs to have privileges to control JDBC connection parameters; 2) and there should be a vulnerable class (constructor with URL parameter and ability to execute code) in the classpath. From Apache Calcite Avatica 1.22.0 onwards, it will be verified that the class implements the expected interface before invoking its constructor.", "datePublished": "2022-07-28T08:35:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T10:00:04", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36364", "https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica/commit/0c097b6a685fc1f97f151505a219976f15ed0c4c", "https://github.com/apache/calcite-avatica", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/5csdj8bv4h3hfgw27okm84jh1j2fyw0c", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/28/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36364", "GHSA-w7f5-jrpr-5c2m"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 10.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c43299ed-99a7-3635-bddf-43c23d66fd4c", "product": {"name": "Apache Calcite Avatica"}, "product_version": "Apache Calcite Avatica <1.22.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ee7d41eb-049f-3cdd-8894-4142d9e76da4", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
