An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.", "datePublished": "2018-05-17T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:35:37", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7160", "https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/e3950d1a402b80e4098a40aacddd6a104da0cfa9", "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K63025104?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS", "https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-7160.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2949", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2018-7160.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-7160", "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/march-2018-security-releases/", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K63025104?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-7160", "GHSA-wq4c-wm6x-jw44"], "assigner": "nodejs", "epss": 1.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d59fbd8-4496-367e-8dc2-1033f22c379d", "product": {"name": "Node.js"}, "product_version": "^6.0.0 || ^8.0.0 || ^9.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5227b9b1-dd1d-348e-bf1d-27f437092b13", "vendor": {"name": "The Node.js Project"}}], "isExploited": false}
