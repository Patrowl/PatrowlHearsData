A use-after-free in io_sqpoll_wait_sq in fs/io_uring.c allows an attacker to crash the kernel, resulting in denial of service. finish_wait can be skipped. An attack can occur in some situations by forking a process and then quickly terminating it. NOTE: later kernel versions, such as the 5.15 longterm series, substantially changed the implementation of io_sqpoll_wait_sq.", "datePublished": "2022-12-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T15:02:36", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-47946.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2022-47946", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/22/2", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?h=v5.10.161&id=0f544353fec8e717d37724d95b92538e1de79e86", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/27/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-47946"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ad077bc-f7b4-3f68-8824-dee9f3d02873", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db16d188-e27f-37b7-9956-e8f6c682bc36", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
