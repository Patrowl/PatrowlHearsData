When Tulip reads or writes to the rx/tx descriptor or copies the rx/tx frame, it doesn't check whether the destination address is its own MMIO address. This can cause the device to trigger MMIO handlers multiple times, possibly leading to a stack or heap overflow. A malicious guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service condition.", "datePublished": "2022-09-13T19:18:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:11:03", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-2962.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-2962", "https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/1171", "https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/36a894aeb64a2e02871016da1c37d4a4ca109182"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2962"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c4a2c3ad-dc80-3f03-a870-5aaa3f5142ce", "product": {"name": "qemu"}, "product_version": "Will be fixed in QEMU 7.2.0-rc0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ca131352-3611-3848-b620-69716204cb46", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
