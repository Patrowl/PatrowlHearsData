Prior to version 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1.", "datePublished": "2022-06-14T20:40:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:15:50", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/security/advisories/GHSA-q874-g24w-4q9g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29241", "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/3485007abbb459585357212dcaa20521989272e8", "https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server/commit/877da10cd0d7ae45f8b1e385fa1f5a335e7adf1f", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/jupyter-server/PYSEC-2022-211.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-29241.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29241", "GHSA-q874-g24w-4q9g", "PYSEC-2022-211"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ef84c8b4-0e69-374b-8266-ccc9512b12c1", "product": {"name": "jupyter_server"}, "product_version": "< 1.17.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "69d8466a-216d-3392-abaf-3fdc47360987", "vendor": {"name": "jupyter-server"}}], "isExploited": false}
