{"id": "EUVD-2022-7391", "enisaUuid": "e240bd10-7eff-3620-ad46-bbb4ed99af37", "description": "The Electron framework enables writing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7, Electron is vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following a redirect, Electron delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as `file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include sending hashed credentials.This issue has been patched in versions: 21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended to upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')` event, for all WebContents as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-11-08T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:40:13", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-p2jh-44qj-pf2v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36077", "https://github.com/electron/electron"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36077", "GHSA-p2jh-44qj-pf2v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81366064-0d0c-3b2f-8201-630fc694db51", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "v21.0.0-nightly.20220526, < 21.0.0-beta.1"}, {"id": "93140bdd-6b0a-321c-94ce-357e84a931f1", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "19.0.0-beta.1, < 19.0.11"}, {"id": "9b478d3d-124a-3cb8-be4d-a49d1acf1fc7", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "20.0.0-beta.1, < 20.0.1"}, {"id": "b076f903-cd39-3113-bf59-bafbd8b07b72", "product": {"name": "electron"}, "product_version": "< 18.3.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a968ad3-2551-3877-be25-b76c4192013d", "vendor": {"name": "electron"}}], "isExploited": false}
