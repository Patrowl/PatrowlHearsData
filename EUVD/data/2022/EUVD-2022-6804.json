Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a successful decryption. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-09-28T20:05:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:54:40", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/security/advisories/GHSA-fpgf-pjjv-2qgm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39248", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/commit/77df720a238d17308deab83ecaa37f7a4740a17e", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/releases/tag/v1.5.1", "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39248", "GHSA-fpgf-pjjv-2qgm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f69e3305-f787-3b1a-b0af-8c4fae264231", "product": {"name": "matrix-android-sdk2"}, "product_version": "< 1.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1aaf0c63-5b10-3f0a-b990-9ee60754e547", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
