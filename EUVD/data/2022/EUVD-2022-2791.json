Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-05-20T13:55:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:25:13", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-6gcg-hp2x-q54h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24904", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/5e767a4b9e30983330c0fdec322192281a90eb84", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/7357cfdb58a560de70a0538c6e3bef6fe39505ea", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/d36d95dc9f71ec61c1a93794f81ece6d61a0d943", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.1.15", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.2.9", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.3.4", "github.com/argoproj/argo-cd", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4671", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4690", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4691", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4692"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24904", "GHSA-6gcg-hp2x-q54h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5faf51e5-4adf-3d84-8119-4205c8b8618f", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "0.7.0, < 2.1.15"}, {"id": "6584c3f2-646d-303f-a0cf-db801b8ce59b", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.2.0, < 2.2.9"}, {"id": "a58e8e8f-d978-3b55-ab79-6fa21ddc23a2", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.3.0, < 2.3.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d5418600-b4b7-3408-9ca3-ec53f1cf0bb1", "vendor": {"name": "argoproj"}}], "isExploited": false}
