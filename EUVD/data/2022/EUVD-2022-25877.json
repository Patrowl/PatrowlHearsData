These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-05-03T03:16:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:17:58", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-qXz4uAkM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20627"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "25a7f693-df05-37e6-b7d1-3e450fe4738e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3fa31062-b7cf-32d3-861f-dfbb1fefd1e3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
