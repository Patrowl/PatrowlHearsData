Versions of Plone that are dependent on Products.ATContentTypes prior to version 3.0.6 are vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings. Version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix. This version works on Plone 5.2, Python 2 only. As a workaround, make sure the image_view_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache. More information about the vulnerability and cvmitigation measures is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.", "datePublished": "2022-01-28T22:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2022-02-04T17:23:45", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/plone/Products.ATContentTypes/commit/fc793f88f35a15a68b52e4abed77af0da5fdbab8", "https://github.com/plone/Products.ATContentTypes/security/advisories/GHSA-g4c2-ghfg-g5rh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23599", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/products-atcontenttypes/PYSEC-2022-21.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23599", "GHSA-g4c2-ghfg-g5rh", "PYSEC-2022-21"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3b3f6c3a-745b-368e-9641-660200d0901f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "832f3a4e-4ced-3714-aa41-90054502b8a0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
