Bouncy Castle release 1.47 changes the BKS format to a format which uses a 160 bit HMAC instead. This applies to any BKS keystore generated prior to BC 1.47. For situations where people need to create the files for legacy reasons a specific keystore type \"BKS-V1\" was introduced in 1.49. It should be noted that the use of \"BKS-V1\" is discouraged by the library authors and should only be used where it is otherwise safe to do so, as in where the use of a 16 bit checksum for the file integrity check is not going to cause a security issue in itself.", "datePublished": "2018-04-16T13:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T16:27:56", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-5382", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2927", "https://www.bouncycastle.org/releasenotes.html", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/306792", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103453", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-5382.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-5382", "GHSA-8477-3v39-ggpm"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "772d7be7-de60-3371-b8b4-2c5cb18b95d1", "product": {"name": "Bouncy Castle"}, "product_version": "all <1.47"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e3797b9-bf0f-3863-b67b-7b6ebae3180b", "vendor": {"name": "Legion of the Bouncy Castle"}}], "isExploited": false}
