GoCD versions 19.11.0 through 21.4.0 (inclusive) are vulnerable to a Document Object Model (DOM)-based cross-site scripting attack via a pipeline run's Stage Details > Graphs tab. It is possible for a malicious script on a attacker-hosted site to execute script that will run within the user's browser context and GoCD session via abuse of a messaging channel used for communication between with the parent page and the stage details graph's iframe. This could allow an attacker to steal a GoCD user's session cookies and/or execute malicious code in the user's context. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-05-20T19:05:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:24:22", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.1.0", "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-1-0", "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-qcg6-4q44-3589", "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/pull/10190/commits/a256d05de1445e6c77843f098581fc6a66fe4477"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29182"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "afbe4746-853c-373a-b452-8e844979665e", "product": {"name": "gocd"}, "product_version": "19.11.0, < 22.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ab3393ce-0c70-3c46-be30-3e4f7b9be04e", "vendor": {"name": "gocd"}}], "isExploited": false}
