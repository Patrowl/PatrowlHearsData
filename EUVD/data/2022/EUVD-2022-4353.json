{"id": "EUVD-2022-4353", "enisaUuid": "de93cebd-22b6-30b0-a4e9-7055edd1b00e", "description": "A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before 0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing a public key can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted for verification. An attacker could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects by removing the original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and then signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with the public key embedded in that JWS header.", "datePublished": "2018-01-04T06:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-02T20:58:29", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0114", "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose", "https://github.com/cisco/node-jose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md", "https://github.com/zi0Black/POC-CVE-2018-0114", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAlert.x?alertId=56326", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210124130907/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102445", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44324", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2018-0114", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44324/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-0114", "GHSA-jfxm-w8g2-4rcv"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 84.88, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "980a53d5-e3d4-3057-8589-0c54edb531f5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
