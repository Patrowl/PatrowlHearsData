It is possible to include a UNC path in the OpenVPN configuration file when referencing file paths for parameters (such as auth-user-pass). When this file is imported and the client attempts to validate the file path, it performs an open operation on the path and leaks the user's Net-NTLMv2 hash to an external server. This could be exploited by having a user open a crafted malicious ovpn configuration file.", "datePublished": "2022-04-14T15:18:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T04:36:05", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/CVEs", "https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cve-2022-25165-aws-vpn-client/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-25166"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d7be6cdc-7a86-3f9f-b10d-f223acc8d30e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f401d23-d78d-3a1c-8a4c-633e5fbc5eab", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
