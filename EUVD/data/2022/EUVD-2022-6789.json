The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe \u2014 and as such rejected \u2014 by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn\u2019t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature instead.", "datePublished": "2022-09-08T13:30:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:23:14", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/security/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36085", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/25a597bc3f4985162e7f65f9c36599f4f8f55823", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/3e8c754ed007b22393cf65e48751ad9f6457fee8", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa", "https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/tag/v0.43.1", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0978"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36085", "GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "45772c6d-8390-3c68-9cbd-d6ebecd7fe55", "product": {"name": "opa"}, "product_version": "0.40.0, < 0.43.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "067372f5-06bd-3959-96be-54e3631951d9", "vendor": {"name": "open-policy-agent"}}], "isExploited": false}
