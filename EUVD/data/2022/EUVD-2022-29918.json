By means of a crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the local network can leverage this null byte interaction error in such a way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94 odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher (CVE-2022-25218).", "datePublished": "2022-03-07T21:56:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T04:36:05", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-01"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-25219"], "assigner": "tenable", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac313a19-5f96-3b61-baed-e245fe43b694", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
