This vulnerability is due to improper error handling of an IPv6 packet that is forwarded from an MPLS and ZBFW-enabled interface in a 6VPE deployment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet sourced from a device on the IPv6-enabled virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) interface through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reload the device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-10-10T20:43:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:49:22", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-6vpe-dos-tJBtf5Zv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20915"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42a9c37f-81fe-3368-8ef4-e7e1e4501dd8", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f808248d-e154-3c0b-aab6-96a73de062ff", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
