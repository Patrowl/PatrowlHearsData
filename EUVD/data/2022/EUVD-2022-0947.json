The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.", "datePublished": "2022-02-04T22:32:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:08:04", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9x52-887g-fhc2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23594", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/ir/importexport", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23594.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23594", "GHSA-9x52-887g-fhc2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "710da40a-c5e1-3141-aaa0-702ff2283710", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.7.0, < 2.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da08eb5c-b574-3e95-b968-efad9a952e18", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
