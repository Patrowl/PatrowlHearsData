When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries, Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter), and a parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.", "datePublished": "2022-04-11T20:13:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:41:00", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/yahoo/elide/security/advisories/GHSA-8xpj-9j9g-fc9r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24827", "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/pull/2581", "https://github.com/yahoo/elide", "https://github.com/yahoo/elide/releases/tag/6.1.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24827", "GHSA-8xpj-9j9g-fc9r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2ceb7d1-283a-3af3-a97d-c8239e727b18", "product": {"name": "elide"}, "product_version": "= 6.1.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "827609dc-b93d-3df3-8f0d-fa4a8210288b", "vendor": {"name": "yahoo"}}], "isExploited": false}
