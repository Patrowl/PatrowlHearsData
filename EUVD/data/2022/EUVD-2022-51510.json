The files are created and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder) which inherits permission giving all users full access control list. Netskope client restricts access to this file by allowing only read permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client service restarts, it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates, creating a race condition, which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create the file and set ACL permissions on the file. Once the file is created by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions, all files within C:\\Users\\Public\\netSkope\\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user. By using Windows pseudo-symlink, these files can be pointed to other places in the system and thus malicious users will be able to elevate privileges.\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-15T06:44:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-12T17:05:07", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.netskope.com/company/security-compliance-and-assurance/security-advisories-and-disclosures/netskope-security-advisory-nskpsa-2023-002"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-4149"], "assigner": "Netskope", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d2d7424-f622-35b4-873b-07f0b7000034", "product": {"name": "Netskope client"}, "product_version": "95, 0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80d075cf-970e-3eb8-b099-4463df75f80a", "vendor": {"name": "Netskope"}}], "isExploited": false}
