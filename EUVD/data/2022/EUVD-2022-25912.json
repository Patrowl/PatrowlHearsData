This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.", "datePublished": "2022-09-30T18:45:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:06:47", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-duo-macOS-bypass-uKZNpXE6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20662"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9187bb8f-1100-3cfc-86dc-fc5d4754d5da", "product": {"name": "Cisco Duo "}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f49f25ba-495d-31df-9bc8-fdd65e94f684", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
