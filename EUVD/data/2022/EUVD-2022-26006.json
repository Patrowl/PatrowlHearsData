This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access. Note: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) is required. See the Details section for more information.", "datePublished": "2022-04-06T18:13:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:27:51", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-dos-JLh9TxBp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20756"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e753f76d-8ad8-32aa-b385-744aa8c97b6e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d9bd9cea-2297-3e81-85ed-6df275ccd4bf", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
