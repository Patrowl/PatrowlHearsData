Starting version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the destination file is under destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `destDir` ends with slash. If the `destDir` is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins with the destination directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-01-26T21:10:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:28:07", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32841", "https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib/commit/5c3b293de5d65b108e7f2cd0ea8f81c1b8273f78", "https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib", "https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib/releases/tag/v1.3.3", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-125-sharpziplib", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-125-sharpziplib/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32841", "GHSA-2x7h-96h5-rq84"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0054b6ff-5d5b-3d13-99fc-c623c5254d33", "product": {"name": "SharpZipLib"}, "product_version": "1.3.0 <1.3.0*"}, {"id": "adef3480-b145-3784-8841-9404a22f6067", "product": {"name": "SharpZipLib"}, "product_version": "1.3.3 <1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5d0cc076-e78f-339f-aa4a-89f24d55bcc1", "vendor": {"name": "icsharpcode"}}], "isExploited": false}
