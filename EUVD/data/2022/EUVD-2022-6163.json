A denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in verions 2.8.3 through 2.8.15 of Play's forms library, in both the Scala and Java APIs. This can occur when using either the `Form#bindFromRequest` method on a JSON request body or the `Form#bind` method directly on a JSON value. If the JSON data being bound to the form contains a deeply-nested JSON object or array, the form binding implementation may consume all available heap space and cause an `OutOfMemoryError`. If executing on the default dispatcher and `akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error` is enabled\u2014as it is by default\u2014then this can crash the application process. `Form.bindFromRequest` is vulnerable when using any body parser that produces a type of `AnyContent` or `JsValue` in Scala, or one that can produce a `JsonNode` in Java. This includes Play's default body parser. This vulnerability been patched in version 2.8.16. There is now a global limit on the depth of a JSON object that can be parsed, which can be configured by the user if necessary. As a workaround, applications that do not need to parse a request body of type `application/json` can switch from the default body parser to another body parser that supports only the specific type of body they expect.", "datePublished": "2022-06-02T16:45:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:20:02", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/playframework/playframework/security/advisories/GHSA-v8x6-59g4-5g3w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31018", "https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/11301", "https://github.com/playframework/playframework", "https://github.com/playframework/playframework/releases/tag/2.8.16"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31018", "GHSA-v8x6-59g4-5g3w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d734f719-92d9-3eae-9460-4fe0b6fd5db6", "product": {"name": "playframework"}, "product_version": "2.8.3, < 2.8.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "661fabf9-0b54-3d3e-bd29-db70cdc7d014", "vendor": {"name": "playframework"}}], "isExploited": false}
