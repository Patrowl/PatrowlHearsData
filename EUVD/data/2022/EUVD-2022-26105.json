This vulnerability is due to improper checks throughout the restart of certain system processes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging on to an affected device and executing certain CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS as root. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a privilege level 15 user of the wireless controller.", "datePublished": "2022-09-30T18:46:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:50:27", "baseScore": 7.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ewc-priv-esc-nderYLtK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20855"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "827b2f7d-8fc5-3f8c-b971-4834a97a461c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "81a10359-9c86-36f3-a07f-8fbbda54184e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
