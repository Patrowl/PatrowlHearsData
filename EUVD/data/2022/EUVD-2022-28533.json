Using a modified USB device an attacker can leak stack addresses of the `razer_attr_read_dpi_stages`, potentially bypassing KASLR. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to access to a users keyboard or mouse or would need to convince a user to use a modified device. The issue has been patched in v3.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade and should be reminded not to plug in unknown USB devices.", "datePublished": "2022-12-05T19:22:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T19:26:50", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/security/advisories/GHSA-39hg-jvc9-fg7h", "https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/commit/33aa7f07d54ae066f201c6d298cb4a2181cb90e6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23467"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "162f77bd-64e7-3f71-b0c9-fa4205afe80d", "product": {"name": "openrazer"}, "product_version": "< 3.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a4958e64-28e4-3148-baae-93b8e20b6b4a", "vendor": {"name": "openrazer"}}], "isExploited": false}
