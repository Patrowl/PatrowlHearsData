Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user. This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious key backup spoofed by the homeserver. These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm. matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19 has been modified to only accept Olm-encrypted to-device messages. Out of caution, several other checks have been audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home servers do not need a workaround. To avoid malicious backup attacks, one should not verify one's new logins using emoji/QR verifications methods until patched.", "datePublished": "2022-09-28T20:35:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:54:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-hw6g-j8v6-9hcm", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/commit/5ca86c328a5faaab429c240551cb9ca8f0f6262c", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk/releases/tag/v0.23.19"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39255"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1eacd972-2508-3cc1-8aee-b0e7600676a6", "product": {"name": "matrix-ios-sdk"}, "product_version": "< 0.23.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6686a38f-c443-32f7-8748-5b2f3317b874", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
