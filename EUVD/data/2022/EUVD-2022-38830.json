In version 1.1.8 and prior, due to an unobvious feature of PHP, hashes generated by built-in functions and starting with the `0e` symbols were being handled as zero multiplied with the `e` number. Therefore, the hash value was equal to 0. The maintainers fixed this in version 1.1.9 by using `===` instead of `==` in comparisons where it is possible (e.g. on sign in/sign up handlers).", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T20:45:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:14:24", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mesosoi/silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker/security/advisories/GHSA-w4wq-7j4q-j2fh"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36072"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "75459a8a-19f3-3e44-9230-1987712f5183", "product": {"name": "silverwaregames-io-issue-tracker"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b6924ce2-b79e-3513-9cd1-7eba30af82c4", "vendor": {"name": "mesosoi"}}], "isExploited": false}
