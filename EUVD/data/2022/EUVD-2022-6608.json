The JSPUI resumable upload implementations in SubmissionController and FileUploadRequest are vulnerable to multiple path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to create files/directories anywhere on the server writable by the Tomcat/DSpace user, by modifying some request parameters during submission. This path traversal can only be executed by a user with special privileges (submitter rights). This vulnerability only impacts the JSPUI. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds. However, this vulnerability cannot be exploited by an anonymous user or a basic user. The user must first have submitter privileges to at least one Collection and be able to determine how to modify the request parameters to exploit the vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-08-01T20:25:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:55:28", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-qp5m-c3m9-8q2p", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31194", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7569c6374aefeafb996e202cf8d631020eda5f24", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/d1dd7d23329ef055069759df15cfa200c8e3", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31194", "GHSA-qp5m-c3m9-8q2p"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.79, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02f9c668-f0a4-319b-a7b4-e84c799c6bab", "product": {"name": "DSpace"}, "product_version": "6.0, < 6.4"}, {"id": "dacad438-49e9-3149-b662-e81c128abd35", "product": {"name": "DSpace"}, "product_version": "4.0, < 5.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dc5a7d76-5e2d-3a9c-b6f3-aacc7673fb6a", "vendor": {"name": "DSpace"}}], "isExploited": false}
