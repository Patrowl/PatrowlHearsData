{"id": "EUVD-2022-6921", "enisaUuid": "c7cde7a6-0f1f-3867-9fba-696f4fddf254", "description": "cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version 1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext` are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl. As a workaround, users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext` from their schemas.", "datePublished": "2022-09-08T21:15:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:12:43", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/security/advisories/GHSA-qm4w-4995-vg7f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36084", "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/pull/253", "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl/commit/13b9233733ed6fc822718a07bc90a80cd3492698", "https://github.com/AEB-labs/cruddl"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36084", "GHSA-qm4w-4995-vg7f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f85babd8-98f1-3e9c-9cd5-4f40117bf88d", "product": {"name": "cruddl"}, "product_version": "1.1.0, < 2.7.0"}, {"id": "fde1b4d3-7e6e-3110-ad2c-dfb7592eb63a", "product": {"name": "cruddl"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f4a7dd90-a00d-3d98-a776-dd4651492426", "vendor": {"name": "AEB-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
