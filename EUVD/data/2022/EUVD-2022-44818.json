Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read patient EKG results or create a denial-of-service condition by emitting sounds at similar frequencies as the device, disrupting the smartphone microphone\u2019s ability to accurately read the data. To carry out this attack, the attacker must be close (less than 5 feet) to pick up and emit sound waves.\n\n", "datePublished": "2022-10-27T20:04:06", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-16T16:08:30", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsma-22-298-01"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41627"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b7cc483c-3c60-3140-af94-dff0c62ee503", "product": {"name": "KardiaMobile"}, "product_version": "All"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "99dad089-dae9-378a-b4ea-ac2b278c16ef", "vendor": {"name": "AliveCor"}}], "isExploited": false}
