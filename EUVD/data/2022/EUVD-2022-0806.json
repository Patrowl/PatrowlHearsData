In DBdeployer before version 1.58.2, users unpacking a tarball may use a maliciously packaged tarball that contains symlinks to files external to the target. In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defenses. For the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1) The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it was designed to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared before attempting to unpack. This has been fixed in version 1.58.2.", "datePublished": "2020-12-21T21:15:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:03", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/security/advisories/GHSA-47wr-426j-fr82", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26277", "https://github.com/datacharmer/dbdeployer/commit/548e256c1de2f99746e861454e7714ec6bc9bb10"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26277", "GHSA-47wr-426j-fr82"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6bb83162-ddce-3e38-9331-bfc1c9f2d328", "product": {"name": "dbdeployer"}, "product_version": "< 1.58.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "607ccedd-978d-3205-9334-44f06db9fd6f", "vendor": {"name": "datacharmer"}}], "isExploited": false}
