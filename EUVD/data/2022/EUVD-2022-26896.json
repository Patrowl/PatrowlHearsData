In versions prior to 0.52.2 actors can bypass capability authorization. Actors are normally required to declare their capabilities for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability actor capability claims are not verified upon receiving invocations. This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers. The problem has been patched in versions `0.52.2` and greater. There is no workaround and users are advised to upgrade to an unaffected version as soon as possible.", "datePublished": "2022-01-21T22:20:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:09:43", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp/security/advisories/GHSA-2cmx-rr54-88g5", "https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-otp/commit/fd07262074b98b06106a31fd1957dc2319d438a5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21707"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "05746f94-d368-3b36-9fcd-2496d058144f", "product": {"name": "wasmcloud-otp"}, "product_version": "< 0.52.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "88aa76b8-e5db-3867-a8bf-ca44a7b55003", "vendor": {"name": "wasmCloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
