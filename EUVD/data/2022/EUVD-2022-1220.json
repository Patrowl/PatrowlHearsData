In Fleet before version 3.5.1, due to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP. Users that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue. This issue is patched in 3.5.1. The fix was made using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator If upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.", "datePublished": "2020-12-17T19:40:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T15:56:04", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-26276", "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/commit/57812a532e5f749c8e18c6f6a652eca65c083607", "https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#fleet-351-dec-14-2020", "https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator", "https://mattermost.com/blog/coordinated-disclosure-go-xml-vulnerabilities"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-26276", "GHSA-w3wf-cfx3-6gcx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "62921695-3fba-3143-a7bf-0641404a6324", "product": {"name": "Fleet"}, "product_version": "< 3.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b885aa52-3793-3454-96cd-3e6b5d346a15", "vendor": {"name": "fleetdm"}}], "isExploited": false}
