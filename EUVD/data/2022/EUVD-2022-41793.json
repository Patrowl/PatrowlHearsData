This vulnerability would allow other server owners to create configurations such as \"Better-Audit-Logging\" which contain a channel from another server as a target. This would mean you could send log messages to another Guild channel and bypass raid and webhook protections. A specifically crafted log message could allow spamming and mass advertisements. This issue has been patched in version 1.9.9. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-10-13T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:50:15", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/security/advisories/GHSA-v574-xgcf-5w8x", "https://github.com/Ree6-Applications/Ree6/commit/459b5bc24f0ea27e50031f563373926e94b9aa0a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39302"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e6505a9a-e015-3338-9d52-fec74016400e", "product": {"name": "Ree6"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "959898e0-1561-3bea-a3bc-21b62875af4f", "vendor": {"name": "Ree6-Applications"}}], "isExploited": false}
