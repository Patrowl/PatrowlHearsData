Versions 2.8.2 and prior in the `stable` branch, 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `beta` branch, and 2.9.0.beta3 and prior in the `tests-passed` branch are vulnerable to a data leak. Users can request an export of their own activity. Sometimes, due to category settings, they may have category membership for a secure category. The name of this secure category is shown to the user in the export. The same thing occurs when the user's post has been moved to a secure category. A patch for this issue is available in the `main` branch of Discourse's GitHub repository and is anticipated to be part of future releases.", "datePublished": "2022-03-24T20:35:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:43:48", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-c3cq-w899-f343", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16273", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/9d5737fd28374cc876c070f6c3a931a8071ec356"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24782"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ed2fcc3-ebf7-343d-a472-4e3ee04691ba", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "tests-passed \u2264 2.9.0.beta3"}, {"id": "55649915-4a30-3a69-b181-ab9e753ab9ef", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "stable \u2264 2.8.2"}, {"id": "b028ad71-4f29-3661-b77e-e88a3930dfe3", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "beta \u2264 2.9.0.beta3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d4489331-ba7d-3853-99f4-ab7f0a02ae67", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
