It resolves a symlink in the host context during a copy operation from the container to the host, because an undesired glob operation occurs. An attacker could create a container image containing particular symlinks that, when copied by a victim user to the host filesystem, may overwrite existing files with others from the host.", "datePublished": "2019-10-28T12:37:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:54:14", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18466", "https://github.com/containers/libpod/issues/3829", "https://github.com/containers/libpod/commit/5c09c4d2947a759724f9d5aef6bac04317e03f7e", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4269", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1744588", "https://github.com/containers/libpod", "https://github.com/containers/libpod/compare/v1.5.1...v1.6.0", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18466.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1227", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00040.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-18466", "GHSA-r34v-gqmw-qvgj"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b7517d73-61da-3329-8cd6-2bd6e97c1b9f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c20b3f8b-03eb-3592-95eb-8f008d99aafd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
