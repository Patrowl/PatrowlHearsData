{"id": "EUVD-2022-4596", "enisaUuid": "177622f6-9868-3927-bdf9-421cfb1f77da", "description": "An issue was discovered in the OpenSSL library in Ruby before 2.3.8, 2.4.x before 2.4.5, 2.5.x before 2.5.2, and 2.6.x before 2.6.0-preview3. When two OpenSSL::X509::Name objects are compared using ==, depending on the ordering, non-equal objects may return true. When the first argument is one character longer than the second, or the second argument contains a character that is one less than a character in the same position of the first argument, the result of == will be true. This could be leveraged to create an illegitimate certificate that may be accepted as legitimate and then used in signing or encryption operations.", "datePublished": "2018-11-16T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T10:24:32", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-16395", "https://github.com/ruby/openssl/commit/f653cfa43f0f20e8c440122ea982382b6228e7f5", "https://hackerone.com/reports/387250", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/11/06/ruby-2-6-0-preview3-released", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-5-2-released", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-4-5-released", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-3-8-released", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/openssl-x509-name-equality-check-does-not-work-correctly-cve-2018-16395", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4332", "https://web.archive.org/web/20211206015239/https://securitytracker.com/id/1042105", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3808-1", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190221-0002", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/10/msg00020.html", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/openssl/CVE-2018-16395.yml", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2565", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1948", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3738", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3731", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3730", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3729", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00036.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-16395.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2018-16395", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2018-16395.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2018-16395.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2018-16395.html", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/openssl-x509-name-equality-check-does-not-work-correctly-cve-2018-16395/", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/11/06/ruby-2-6-0-preview3-released/", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-3-8-released/", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3808-1/", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-4-5-released/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190221-0002/", "https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2018/10/17/ruby-2-5-2-released/", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1042105"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-16395", "GHSA-mmrq-6999-72v8"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 4.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "720a6218-2e81-3284-9ef8-9d7603657a1e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d85c453-b953-352a-9251-b6ced4616ece", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
