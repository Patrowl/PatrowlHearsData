Because of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery options in Contiki-NG, attackers can send neighbor solicitation packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read. The problem exists in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c, where memory read operations from the main packet buffer, <code>uip_buf</code>, are not checked if they go out of bounds. In particular, this problem can occur when attempting to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO). This attack requires ipv6 be enabled for the network. The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include the patch.Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1654.", "datePublished": "2022-08-04T20:30:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:53:28", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/releases/tag/release%2Fv4.8", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-4hpq-4f53-w386", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654/commits/a4597001d50a04f4b9c78f323ba731e2f979802c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35926"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "32ad5d93-1227-389f-b3c2-4215bff677bb", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e172a8d4-c809-359f-99eb-b54e46953e72", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
