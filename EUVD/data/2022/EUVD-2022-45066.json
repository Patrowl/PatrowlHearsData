Versions prior to 2.4.3, are subject to Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity, resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker can make a Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId, meetingId, and an invalid authToken. This forces the victim to leave the conference, because the resulting verification failure is also observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker must be a participant in any meeting on the server. This issue is patched in version 2.4.3. There are no workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-12-15T23:56:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T12:56:38", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-rgjp-3r74-g4cm", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4.3", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.5-alpha-1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41960"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ade82eb-606b-31d1-a865-09a6a9378314", "product": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}, "product_version": "< 2.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fac18ffb-4539-3c5f-81d1-0f1348c1d1f0", "vendor": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}}], "isExploited": false}
