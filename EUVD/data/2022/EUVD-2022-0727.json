{"id": "EUVD-2022-0727", "enisaUuid": "42eab5cb-2147-32ad-b66f-3308de2847fe", "description": "Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 12.0.0 and prior to version 12.0.9, vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone using i18n functionality. In order to be affected by this CVE, one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2022-01-28T22:00:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-05T16:33:30", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21721", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33503", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js", "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.0.9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21721", "GHSA-wr66-vrwm-5g5x"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d6606d5b-0e3e-3f91-a160-21a5ce5414fd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "59050504-ced6-3b8d-a42e-b8ad67ac90fa", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
