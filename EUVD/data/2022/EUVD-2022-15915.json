To exchange important messages such as the State of Charge (SoC) with the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) CCS uses a high-bandwidth IP link provided by the HomePlug Green PHY (HPGP) power-line communication (PLC) technology. The attack interrupts necessary control communication between the vehicle and charger, causing charging sessions to abort. The attack can be conducted wirelessly from a distance using electromagnetic interference, allowing individual vehicles or entire fleets to be disrupted simultaneously. In addition, the attack can be mounted with off-the-shelf radio hardware and minimal technical knowledge. With a power budget of 1 W, the attack is successful from around 47 m distance. The exploited behavior is a required part of the HomePlug Green PHY, DIN 70121 & ISO 15118 standards and all known implementations exhibit it. In addition to electric cars, Brokenwire affects electric ships, airplanes and heavy duty vehicles utilising these standards.", "datePublished": "2022-04-12T12:00:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T23:40:53", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.brokenwire.fail/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-0878"], "assigner": "NCSC.ch", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "310305b5-3298-3798-a0c7-924d624737c3", "product": {"name": "Combined Charging System"}, "product_version": "Current version \u22642.0"}, {"id": "3bbfc196-d0bb-38f3-9500-35341e8d2188", "product": {"name": "HomePlug GreenPHY"}, "product_version": "Current version \u22641.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "69e8275c-0f9d-3769-b73d-cb5827b289a6", "vendor": {"name": "Combined Charging System"}}], "isExploited": false}
