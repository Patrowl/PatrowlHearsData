Pimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. The actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. This issue has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-06-27T21:25:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:53:25", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-gvmf-wcx6-p974", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31092", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/12444", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/21559c6bf0e4e828d33ff7af6e88caecb5ac6549", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31092", "GHSA-gvmf-wcx6-p974"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b88c0ea-31a1-32e8-969e-07b39a93541b", "product": {"name": "pimcore"}, "product_version": "< 10.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6519afb4-8fae-32a6-b394-4025ad42a34b", "vendor": {"name": "pimcore"}}], "isExploited": false}
