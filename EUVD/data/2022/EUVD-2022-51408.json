This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This would be highly complex to exploit as it would require the attacker to set the cookie a cookie for the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2022-11-29T20:10:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T01:27:54", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/A:N/I:L/C:L/S:C/UI:R/PR:N/AC:H/AV:N", "references": ["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2804020%40simplepress&new=2804020%40simplepress&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-4029"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-4029"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 3.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cbec1695-9502-3f09-8252-8a5b592df605", "product": {"name": "Simple:Press \u2013 WordPress Forum Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7df2815a-33a5-3901-8c44-6a69327ab94b", "vendor": {"name": "simplepress"}}], "isExploited": false}
