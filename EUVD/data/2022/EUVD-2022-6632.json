{"id": "EUVD-2022-6632", "enisaUuid": "78ca5a96-8ce0-3280-a21b-8576ef420e11", "description": "cosign is a container signing and verification utility. In versions prior to 1.10.1 cosign can report a false positive if any attestation exists. `cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when there is at least one attestation with a valid signature and there are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\"). This can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with \"keyless\" signing with Fulcio. This vulnerability can be reproduced with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2` image. This image has a `vuln` attestation but not an `spdx` attestation. However, if you run `cosign verify-attestation --type=spdx` on this image, it incorrectly succeeds. This issue has been addressed in version 1.10.1 of cosign. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-08-04T18:45:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:43:02", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/security/advisories/GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35929", "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/commit/c5fda01a8ff33ca981f45a9f13e7fb6bd2080b94", "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-35929.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35929", "GHSA-vjxv-45g9-9296"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d4364e6f-61ec-3426-a84e-f56cab086364", "product": {"name": "cosign"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a9c5865-2f3b-3951-8afc-1085c059fd34", "vendor": {"name": "sigstore"}}], "isExploited": false}
