An attacker can pass a compromised input to the e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a href=\"http://attacker.com\">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`. This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to `sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade. Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or efficiently sanitize it.", "datePublished": "2022-07-06T18:00:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:51:28", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/security/advisories/GHSA-pgjx-7f9g-9463", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31127", "https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/commit/ae834f1e08a4a9915665eecb9479c74c6b039c9c", "https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth", "https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/releases/tag/next-auth%40v4.9.0", "https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/upgrade-v4", "https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email#customizing-emails"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31127", "GHSA-pgjx-7f9g-9463"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3b4ae058-d5ac-3451-bd8c-ba0aebb2f9b7", "product": {"name": "next-auth"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.9.0"}, {"id": "7f378bc0-be48-3819-afc4-f5dbdc2a37fd", "product": {"name": "next-auth"}, "product_version": "< 3.29.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "adb0dc76-4a3a-3246-b6f8-c6ec8d09cef4", "vendor": {"name": "nextauthjs"}}], "isExploited": false}
