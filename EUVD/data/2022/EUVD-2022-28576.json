When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users are advised to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2022-02-22T22:20:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:01:49", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23606.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1275", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1276", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-9vp2-4cp7-vvxf", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/4b6dd3b53cd5c6d4d4df378a2fc62c1707522b31"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23606"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2cc057d0-bab4-34c6-a520-7b7764d8638f", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.20.0, < 1.20.2"}, {"id": "417f882b-5228-3b0c-b1c3-6d4db57de492", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.21.0, < 1.21.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7e4e6bfe-f10e-30b3-a762-9962f18f669f", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
