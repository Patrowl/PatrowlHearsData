An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive, browser-based information. In some cases, it is also possible to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.", "datePublished": "2022-11-10T17:42:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T02:31:58", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-LATZYzxs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20935"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "516e6f1a-51da-346e-840c-c344472966b6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.2"}, {"id": "78be5f6b-fef7-3dc3-b673-e3b97c947d65", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0"}, {"id": "baa79daa-9d3b-3ead-aeb2-4bd56a2ea982", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.2.0.1"}, {"id": "df8308f7-758a-3e3b-a563-0f845ff4d370", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.2.0"}, {"id": "f9a92ef3-c009-3563-9d8a-4d578eb4df6b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3e29b9fa-1502-3295-ad7d-0654aa5f17fa", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
