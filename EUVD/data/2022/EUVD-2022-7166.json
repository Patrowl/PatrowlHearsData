Dex instances with public clients (and by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances) are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token, gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0 has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-10-06T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:20:02", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39222", "https://github.com/dexidp/dex/commit/49471b14c8080ddb034d4855841123d378b7a634", "https://github.com/dexidp/dex", "https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases/tag/v2.35.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39222", "GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a7f2acbe-6f98-3632-93f2-12e6d47e1637", "product": {"name": "dex"}, "product_version": "< 2.35.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "df258451-26a8-38b0-86de-7790408366bc", "vendor": {"name": "dexidp"}}], "isExploited": false}
