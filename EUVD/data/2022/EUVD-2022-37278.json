The attacker needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Filters and Display model features (OnlineBanking > Web Monitoring > Settings > Filters / Display models). The name of a filter or a display model is interpreted as HTML and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. Another issue is present in the Notification feature (OnlineBanking > Configuration > Notifications and alerts > Alerts *). The name of an alert is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. (Also, an issue is present in the File download feature, accessible via /OnlineBanking/cgi/isapi.dll/DOWNLOADFRS. When requesting to show the list of downloadable files, the contents of three form fields are embedded in the JavaScript code without prior sanitization. This is essentially a self-XSS.)", "datePublished": "2023-01-01T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-11T14:07:54", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/sage_xrt_multiple_xss.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-34323"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b5a58a9c-a06d-3b91-bb63-d844d1f8e1d5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f132ced0-e889-3cea-bac1-ba1ba9647965", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
