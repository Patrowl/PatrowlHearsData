The \u201csearch term\" search functionality is not sufficiently sanitized while displaying the results of the search, which can be leveraged to inject arbitrary scripts. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they enter the crafted URL. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the administrator, by an unauthenticated attacker.", "datePublished": "2022-01-10T15:26:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:36:11", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/sismics/docs/commit/4951229576d6892dc58ab8c572e73639ca82d80c", "https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22114"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-22114"], "assigner": "Mend", "epss": 2.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bfaef12e-8ad2-311e-91bf-a59dbd0676fe", "product": {"name": "docs"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u2264v1.9"}, {"id": "ed997d19-4162-39de-85ee-813a4245dab4", "product": {"name": "docs"}, "product_version": "v1.5 <unspecified"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11732f67-18ec-3dc1-b91c-2515e4c011f8", "vendor": {"name": "sismics"}}], "isExploited": false}
