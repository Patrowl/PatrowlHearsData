This vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information, some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII). Note: To access the logs that are stored in the RoomOS Cloud, an attacker would need valid Administrator-level credentials.", "datePublished": "2022-07-06T20:30:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T19:00:40", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-roomos-infodisc-YOTz9Ct7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20768"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4dba7d71-9d3b-3260-996b-86d815c9d340", "product": {"name": "Cisco RoomOS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a271edd2-b610-30c3-b4b0-28007e89c96b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
