{"id": "EUVD-2022-0904", "enisaUuid": "85111bcb-b5d8-36e7-9e5d-93dc27bdba5d", "description": "Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012, but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/multicluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.", "datePublished": "2022-02-22T22:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:02:00", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/istio/istio/security/advisories/GHSA-856q-xv3c-7f2f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23635", "https://github.com/istio/istio/commit/5f3b5ed958ae75156f8656fe7b3794f78e94db84", "https://github.com/istio/istio", "https://istio.io/latest/news/security/istio-security-2022-003", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1275", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1276"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23635", "GHSA-856q-xv3c-7f2f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89ef95e0-4152-3f49-ab9b-9198c81bccd4", "product": {"name": "istio"}, "product_version": "< 1.11.7"}, {"id": "d5ee7a75-3084-3177-948e-3c81689510d0", "product": {"name": "istio"}, "product_version": "1.12.0, < 1.12.4"}, {"id": "e1cc354c-7f8d-32d4-b140-0c92cd8b705f", "product": {"name": "istio"}, "product_version": "1.13.0, < 1.13.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "90c2ee04-e727-3795-8431-a5e4403b9786", "vendor": {"name": "istio"}}], "isExploited": false}
