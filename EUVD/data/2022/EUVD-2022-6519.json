In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/xmlui\", then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path \"/jspui\", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-08-01T20:35:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:55:08", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31195", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/56e76049185bbd87c994128a9d77735ad7af0199", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/7af52a0883a9dbc475cf3001f04ed11b24c8a4c0", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31195", "GHSA-8rmh-55h4-93h5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.79, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "af62144a-940d-3bec-87a0-053dc03d7948", "product": {"name": "DSpace"}, "product_version": "4.0, < 5.11"}, {"id": "b2887f57-306d-3026-95b4-a569065f3b17", "product": {"name": "DSpace"}, "product_version": "6.0, < 6.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "803fa060-2772-3f1b-8a1b-850d0f801727", "vendor": {"name": "DSpace"}}], "isExploited": false}
