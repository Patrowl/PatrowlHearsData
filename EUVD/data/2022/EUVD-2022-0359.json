Waitress versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 may terminate early due to a thread closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled and then causing the entire application to be killed. This issue has been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to close the socket. Instead, that is always delegated to the main thread. There is no work-around for this issue. However, users using waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.", "datePublished": "2022-05-31T22:50:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:55:26", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/377", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/374", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/4f6789b035610e0552738cdc4b35ca809a592d48", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31015", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/waitress/PYSEC-2022-205.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-31015.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31015", "GHSA-f5x9-8jwc-25rw", "PYSEC-2022-205"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66a7fa37-4b27-3cdb-a661-2e0144cdece3", "product": {"name": "Waitress"}, "product_version": "2.1.0, < 2.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ca76965-d890-3b4a-b94b-3ef0362fc363", "vendor": {"name": "Pylons"}}], "isExploited": false}
