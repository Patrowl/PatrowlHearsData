This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-04-06T18:13:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:28:38", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sna-xss-mCA9tQnJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20741"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b660c5a-3c49-3698-b550-4ad4fab2334c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Secure Network Analytics "}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "376eb61d-f5e0-39c0-8a94-7eea0ac75ce0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
