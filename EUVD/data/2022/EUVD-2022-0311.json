In multiple places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files. While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the `mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits, replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions, according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.", "datePublished": "2022-02-04T22:32:38", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:07:51", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-wc4g-r73w-x8mm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23563", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2022-72.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2022-127.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23563.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23563", "GHSA-wc4g-r73w-x8mm", "PYSEC-2022-72"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1c130bc5-5f5e-3574-92f8-c508181e4585", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.3"}, {"id": "2bc7a3da-219a-3bf7-8851-1522ea698312", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.6.0, < 2.6.3"}, {"id": "57a5777e-d405-3c71-8136-eaa661fada4a", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.7.0, < 2.7.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cceabb7c-ccb2-3a9a-9fab-aa243e53f172", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
