This vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization while querying the external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted query through an external authentication web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, including user credentials from the external authentication server. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid operator-level (or higher) credentials.", "datePublished": "2022-06-15T17:55:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:12:34", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-esasma-info-dsc-Q9tLuOvM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20664"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bc1c3506-51ec-34f1-9688-228df1d7f83c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd884b6e-52d6-3095-913b-8e9f0d9753d1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
