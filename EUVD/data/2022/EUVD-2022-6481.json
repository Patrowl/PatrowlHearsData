A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths. Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\" ]` When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine: `(load-resource \"test.png\")` => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\" `(load-resource \"../resources-alt/test.png\")` => rejected, outside the load path When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")` => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\" `(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")` => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\" !!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability. This issue\u2019s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"`, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`. Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this issue. Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.18, if you are on a version < 1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-08-14T00:25:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:41:52", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jlangch/venice/security/advisories/GHSA-4mmh-5vw7-rgvj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36007", "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/commit/215ae91bb964013b0a2d70718a692832d561ae0a", "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/commit/c942c73136333bc493050910f171a48e6f575b23", "https://github.com/jlangch/venice", "https://github.com/jlangch/venice/releases/tag/v1.10.17"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36007", "GHSA-4mmh-5vw7-rgvj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8617b8ec-54bd-3422-9fcb-9382f9aa62ae", "product": {"name": "venice"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.10.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01cee512-f6be-3938-b3f2-c8c56a55d98a", "vendor": {"name": "jlangch"}}], "isExploited": false}
