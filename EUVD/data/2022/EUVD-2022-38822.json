The low-power IPv6 network stack of Contiki-NG has a buffer module (os/net/ipv6/uipbuf.c) that processes IPv6 extension headers in incoming data packets. As part of this processing, the function uipbuf_get_next_header casts a pointer to a uip_ext_hdr structure into the packet buffer at different offsets where extension headers are expected to be found, and then reads from this structure. Because of a lack of bounds checking, the casting can be done so that the structure extends beyond the packet's end. Hence, with a carefully crafted packet, it is possible to cause the Contiki-NG system to read data outside the packet buffer. A patch that fixes the vulnerability is included in Contiki-NG 4.8.", "datePublished": "2022-09-01T12:00:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:33:06", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-2j9c-7754-w4cw", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1648"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36053"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d8d734f-1263-3f35-bf86-01f7c5ff61c2", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "05ebfac9-1eee-3501-9873-cdef1390c3e8", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
