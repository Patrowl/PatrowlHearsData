{"id": "EUVD-2022-2461", "enisaUuid": "e3a787f9-7e62-324b-a33b-6717d02cf9a7", "description": "A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.", "datePublished": "2022-05-07T03:40:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:27:10", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/security/advisories/GHSA-4wpp-w5r4-7v5v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29180", "https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/commit/3c90668f955c7ce5ef721e4fc9faee7053232fd3", "https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29180", "GHSA-4wpp-w5r4-7v5v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2173e6c7-a400-33d0-8d33-7ecabfbe750e", "product": {"name": "charm"}, "product_version": "0.9.0, < 0.12.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "64be64fc-4032-3c1f-b4a3-7536b8238bd0", "vendor": {"name": "charmbracelet"}}], "isExploited": false}
