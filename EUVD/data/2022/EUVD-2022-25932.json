This vulnerability is due to inadequate input validation of incoming CAPWAP packets encapsulating multicast DNS (mDNS) queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a wireless network and sending a crafted mDNS query, which would flow through and be processed by the wireless controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:16:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:25:53", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-capwap-mdns-6PSn7gKU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20682"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55b84526-d048-3b8d-82a4-06dd0f323844", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c2a3fa27-6097-39f3-9e96-77ed62fb283d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
