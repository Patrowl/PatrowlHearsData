Most Dubbo users use Hessian2 as the default serialization/deserialization protool, during Hessian2 deserializing the HashMap object, some functions in the classes stored in HasMap will be executed after a series of program calls, however, those special functions may cause remote command execution. For example, the hashCode() function of the EqualsBean class in rome-1.7.0.jar will cause the remotely load malicious classes and execute malicious code by constructing a malicious request. This issue was fixed in Apache Dubbo 2.6.9 and 2.7.8.", "datePublished": "2021-01-11T09:40:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:27:27", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11995", "https://github.com/apache/dubbo/commit/d2e9baf380108950c48e0ab700ccdbf11dd753ab", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5b2df4ef479209dc4ced457b3d58a887763b60b9354c3dc148b2eb5b%40%3Cdev.dubbo.apache.org%3E"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-11995", "GHSA-74mg-6xqx-2vrq"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 1.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6902b4e6-4c78-3953-b12d-695cc781b3fd", "product": {"name": "Apache Dubbo"}, "product_version": "Apache Dubbo <2.6.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ed8ecfd9-1afd-3235-b41b-ccd82d962074", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
