This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory management for certain Snort events. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IP packets that would generate specific Snort events on an affected device. A sustained attack could cause an out of memory condition on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to interrupt all traffic flowing through the affected device. In some circumstances, the attacker may be able to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-05-03T03:15:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:20:47", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-snort-dos-hd2hFgM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20751"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35181d60-8dac-3add-b009-1dc3d92fcece", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c94ca577-e41f-30f5-98a4-04fb3f29847e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
