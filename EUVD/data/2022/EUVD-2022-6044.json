Versions 4.23.0 and 4.24.0 of the octokit gem were published containing world-writeable files. Specifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem. This issue is patched in Octokit 4.25.0. Two workarounds are available. Users can use the previous version of the gem, v4.22.0. Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.", "datePublished": "2022-06-15T22:35:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:11:25", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/security/advisories/GHSA-g28x-pgr3-qqx6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31072", "https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb/commit/1c8edecc9cf23d1ceb959d91a416a69f55ce7d55", "https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/octokit/CVE-2022-31072.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31072", "GHSA-g28x-pgr3-qqx6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "23186208-6086-372f-a106-019ecce8c2a1", "product": {"name": "octokit.rb"}, "product_version": "4.23.0, < 4.25.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25308f24-8e12-3b7e-9602-7ceccd1fd099", "vendor": {"name": "octokit"}}], "isExploited": false}
