This vulnerability is due to suboptimal processing that occurs when establishing a DTLS tunnel as part of an AnyConnect SSL VPN connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of crafted DTLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected VPN headend device. This could cause existing DTLS tunnels to stop passing traffic and prevent new DTLS tunnels from establishing, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: When the attack traffic stops, the device recovers gracefully.", "datePublished": "2022-04-21T18:50:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:22:08", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vpndtls-dos-TunzLEV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20795"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5419442d-7322-36b7-af65-386cdd42785c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aae46bd7-3cb9-33d1-b8af-925a99f7407d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
