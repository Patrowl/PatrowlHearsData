The JSPUI controlled vocabulary servlet is vulnerable to an open redirect attack, where an attacker can craft a malicious URL that looks like a legitimate DSpace/repository URL. When that URL is clicked by the target, it redirects them to a site of the attacker's choice. This issue has been patched in versions 5.11 and 6.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-08-01T20:25:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:55:36", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/security/advisories/GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31193", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/5f72424a478f59061dcc516b866dcc687bc3f9de", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/commit/f7758457b7ec3489d525e39aa753cc70809d9ad9", "https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31193", "GHSA-763j-q7wv-vf3m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8d0a3a1-56a2-3754-9f0c-057c9deb6bb7", "product": {"name": "DSpace"}, "product_version": "4.0, < 5.11"}, {"id": "d80e089f-41f2-3b98-8b7a-5348a2afebde", "product": {"name": "DSpace"}, "product_version": "6.0, < 6.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "62dceef6-8035-3051-a6f0-272a1ed82c9b", "vendor": {"name": "DSpace"}}], "isExploited": false}
