When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, the stack may overflow, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when parsing an expression with several hundred levels of nesting, causing the process to abort immediately. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the process running rulex aborts due to a stack overflow. The crash is fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-06-27T22:10:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:06:21", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/security/advisories/GHSA-v78m-2q7v-fjqp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31099", "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex/commit/60aa2dc03a22d69c8800fec81f99c96958a11363", "https://github.com/rulex-rs/rulex", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0030.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31099", "GHSA-v78m-2q7v-fjqp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02a4ed5e-1ae6-37e2-a0a8-9fd0c924de9f", "product": {"name": "rulex"}, "product_version": "< 0.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "13e447c9-6d9a-37a2-9185-fc1a4748731e", "vendor": {"name": "rulex-rs"}}], "isExploited": false}
