There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path (e.g. a page).", "datePublished": "2020-07-15T20:32:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:55:21", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6164", "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/commit/91d30db88f68b9b87980ef9a59e208a81980b72c", "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/commit/cce2b1630937895aa28c2914837651e7cd56d74b", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/silverstripe/framework/CVE-2020-6164.yaml", "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms", "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6164"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6164", "GHSA-gm5x-hpmw-xpxg"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ef17789-9cd3-3a11-96b2-01ef18e51691", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fce83618-d4cc-339b-8531-e4866f0b123f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
