The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.", "datePublished": "2022-04-06T18:12:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:29:07", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wsa-stored-xss-XPsJghMY"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20781"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "79b41d9a-3827-3a5c-8a84-36573b0d425d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f921c89-537e-3372-a95d-c1b7cbac010a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
