{"id": "EUVD-2022-26129", "enisaUuid": "bdcebbb7-a7a6-3dff-b7c5-9487b03ff315", "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2022-07-21T03:54:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:57:24", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rce-overflow-ygHByAK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20879"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0f5d4538-d33f-30a1-9082-6f87bd763c53", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f927029c-9947-32c3-abc9-c0b2c7b72f90", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
