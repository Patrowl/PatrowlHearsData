In other words, Code by Zapier was providing a customer-controlled general-purpose virtual machine that unintentionally granted full access to all users of a company's account, but was supposed to enforce role-based access control within that company's account. Before 2022-08-17, a customer could have resolved this by (in effect) using a separate virtual machine for an application that held credentials - or other secrets - that weren't supposed to be shared among all of its employees. (Multiple accounts would have been needed to operate these independent virtual machines.)", "datePublished": "2022-09-21T19:46:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:03:53", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-organization-wide-control-over-code-by-zapier/", "https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-vulnerability-disclosure/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-28802"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "924dddce-2f31-3da9-8d47-3b232f7476dd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "518089e4-24ed-3ad1-8294-b4b5ffc2b686", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
