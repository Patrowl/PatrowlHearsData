PAPR also permits the\nhypervisor to discard this SLB entry (because slb_shadow->persistent is\nonly set to SLB_NUM_BOLTED) although it's not known whether any\nimplementations would do this (KVM does not). So this is an extremely\nunlikely bug, only found by inspection.\n\nFix this by also storing user r13 in a temporary location on the kernel\nstack and don't change the r13 register from kernel r13 until the RI=0\ncritical section that does not fault.\n\nThe SCRATCH0 change is not strictly part of the fix, it's only used in\nthe RI=0 section so it does not have the same problem as the previous\nSCRATCH0 bug.", "datePublished": "2025-09-23T15:31:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-23T15:31:07", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5dce84f475d13b773a1a4c823581cab25044d86a", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/73d8082c90f17dfba57cad4ca94db5cae323f1b1", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9d71165d3934e607070c4e48458c0cf161b1baea", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49164"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-49164"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ae08829-c44d-3d73-a89c-82793cdc5d32", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.18"}, {"id": "34ecd567-d643-3836-a514-b161786f8954", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "42f59d82-7be2-3c4e-a48f-5f9c38e63713", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "3.9"}, {"id": "5698a7d2-4dd5-3237-b822-deee325eddb3", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "98ae22e15b430bfed5def01ac1a88ec9396284c8 <5dce84f475d13b773a1a4c823581cab25044d86a"}, {"id": "679e85c3-abb9-3dea-8581-d3031f9eb4f7", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "98ae22e15b430bfed5def01ac1a88ec9396284c8 <9d71165d3934e607070c4e48458c0cf161b1baea"}, {"id": "6cf7134d-d736-3a9b-934f-617427caab83", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "98ae22e15b430bfed5def01ac1a88ec9396284c8 <73d8082c90f17dfba57cad4ca94db5cae323f1b1"}, {"id": "d2b67c03-c254-3474-a4fb-be5d022c04a9", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.17.2"}, {"id": "fb4b8547-70fd-3712-a3d6-96cf0074eea7", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.15.54"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "24fae921-964c-348c-96d7-e6ea4120dc01", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
