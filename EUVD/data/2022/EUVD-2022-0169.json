CILogonOAuthenticator is provided by the OAuthenticator package, and lets users log in to a JupyterHub via CILogon. This is primarily used to restrict a JupyterHub only to users of a given institute. The allowed_idps configuration trait of CILogonOAuthenticator is documented to be a list of domains that indicate the institutions whose users are authorized to access this JupyterHub. This authorization is validated by ensuring that the *email* field provided to us by CILogon has a *domain* that matches one of the domains listed in `allowed_idps`.If `allowed_idps` contains `berkeley.edu`, you might expect only users with valid current credentials provided by University of California, Berkeley to be able to access the JupyterHub. However, CILogonOAuthenticator does *not* verify which provider is used by the user to login, only the email address provided. So a user can login with a GitHub account that has email set to `<something>@berkeley.edu`, and that will be treated exactly the same as someone logging in using the UC Berkeley official Identity Provider. The patch fixing this issue makes a *breaking change* in how `allowed_idps` is interpreted. It's no longer a list of domains, but configuration representing the `EntityID` of the IdPs that are allowed, picked from the [list maintained by CILogon](https://cilogon.org/idplist/). Users are advised to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2022-06-06T21:15:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:18:41", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/security/advisories/GHSA-r7v4-jwx9-wx43", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31027", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/commit/5cd2d1816f90dc5c946e6e38fd2d0ba535624c5c", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/oauthenticator/PYSEC-2022-206.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31027", "GHSA-r7v4-jwx9-wx43", "PYSEC-2022-206"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1b9e0cea-93da-3dd9-9dc1-4bc41bc00f33", "product": {"name": "oauthenticator"}, "product_version": "< 15.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "834dd134-1f33-3662-bbd3-d8a6d1ce5061", "vendor": {"name": "jupyterhub"}}], "isExploited": false}
