{"id": "EUVD-2022-6224", "enisaUuid": "787aa7d6-9df8-3dfc-ad0e-9ddc43702946", "description": "Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Affected versions were found to have insufficient escaping of white space when interpolating output. This issue only impacts users that use the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. The result is that if an attacker is able to include whitespace in their input they can: 1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after whitespace. 2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters. 3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a line feed character. 4. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return character. Behaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Behaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. The best workaround is to avoid having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible, see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations. Alternatively, users may strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `'\\u0085'` which is not included in JavaScript's definition of `\\s` for Regular Expressions.", "datePublished": "2022-08-01T19:15:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:46:22", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-44vr-rwwj-p88h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31180", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/332", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7", "https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31180", "GHSA-44vr-rwwj-p88h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c89d24cc-8794-3a3e-9899-df788df8250c", "product": {"name": "shescape"}, "product_version": "1.4.0 < 1.5.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "457ce63e-c19a-346f-a2f8-7d41d973b4cf", "vendor": {"name": "ericcornelissen"}}], "isExploited": false}
