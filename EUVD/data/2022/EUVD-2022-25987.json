This vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing specific HTTP authentication messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device acting as a VPN Gateway. To send this malicious traffic, an attacker would need to control a web server that can be accessed through the Clientless SSL VPN portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or to retrieve bytes from the device process memory that may contain sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2022-05-03T03:16:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:19:08", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ssl-vpn-heap-zLX3FdX"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20737"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "efe19ca3-6142-3c6b-8a57-a86eb6babe16", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bdf391e3-6d7e-30c3-821f-b9b8f5c3edea", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
