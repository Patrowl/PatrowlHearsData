A file disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Autolab's remote handin feature, whereby users are able to hand-in assignments using paths outside their submission directory. Users can then view the submission to view the file's contents. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.10.0. As a workaround, ensure that the field for the remote handin feature is empty (Edit Assessment > Advanced > Remote handin path), and that you are not running Autolab as `root` (or any user that has write access to `/`). Alternatively, disable the remote handin feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of `local_submit` in `app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb` with `render(plain: \"Feature disabled\", status: :bad_request) && return`.", "datePublished": "2023-01-14T00:40:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T12:56:38", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-g7x7-mgrv-f24x", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-100_Autolab/", "https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/rails-path-traversal-guide-examples-and-prevention/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41956"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61a619b3-6371-35e0-8b5e-8776027d9e41", "product": {"name": "Autolab"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ba36752-8d79-3c85-ab1d-4595c6bcdfde", "vendor": {"name": "autolab"}}], "isExploited": false}
