In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2, Tauri is vulnerable to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality, it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7, 1.1.2 and 1.2.0. As a workaround, disable the dialog and fileDropEnabled component inside the tauri.conf.json.", "datePublished": "2022-11-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:38:40", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-q9wv-22m9-vhqh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41874", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/5234", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5237", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0091.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41874", "GHSA-q9wv-22m9-vhqh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ca3159df-1c30-32e4-b5b9-2410eb36ed58", "product": {"name": "tauri"}, "product_version": "1.1.0, <1.1.2"}, {"id": "f91e86c4-e5f8-3c71-a35b-b74b8ae4f6a9", "product": {"name": "tauri"}, "product_version": "1.0.0, <1.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01ad7230-0dec-3af6-aafe-d98dcea1697b", "vendor": {"name": "tauri-apps"}}], "isExploited": false}
