(This is also fixed in 5.3.8.12, 21.06.9, and 22.03.2 for LTS users.) Some Java application frameworks, including those used by Spring or Tomcat, allow the use of matrix parameters: these are URI parameters separated by semicolons. Through precise semicolon placement in a URI, it is possible to exploit this feature to avoid dotCMS's path-based XSS prevention (such as \"require login\" filters), and consequently access restricted resources. For example, an attacker could place a semicolon immediately before a / character that separates elements of a filesystem path. This could reveal file content that is ordinarily only visible to signed-in users. This issue can be chained with other exploit code to achieve XSS attacks against dotCMS.", "datePublished": "2022-11-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T09:44:21", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.dotcms.com/security/SI-63", "https://github.com/dotCMS/patches-hotfixes/tree/master/com.dotcms.security.matrixparams"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35740"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f47da148-66bb-3d02-a47c-9f47558aa314", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "69fbb6f3-f67c-308f-aaa7-91bbcf4d7543", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
