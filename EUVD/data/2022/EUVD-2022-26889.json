{"id": "EUVD-2022-26889", "enisaUuid": "8f35dfe0-dd05-335c-9e60-7ce681fb4f77", "description": "Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as the group members. By default, a newly created group has its visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version 2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside from upgrading.", "datePublished": "2022-01-14T16:45:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:12:05", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-768r-ppv4-5r27", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/fff8b98485561b12d070c0a8c39f4e503813ab44"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21677"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "83848936-9f14-3511-b9ca-5fc901ea31e9", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.0.beta11"}, {"id": "98bb438a-a24e-3c70-915c-bf9294f72413", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c3be1c1-beae-3e57-b711-b87920f1ef5f", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
