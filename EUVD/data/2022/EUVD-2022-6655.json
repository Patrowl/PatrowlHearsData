Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version 1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested (sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the `tauri.conf.json`.", "datePublished": "2022-09-15T21:35:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:21:33", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39215", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4882", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/5123/commits/1f9b9e8d26a2c915390323e161020bcb36d44678", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/bb178829086e80916f9be190f02d83bc25802799", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/releases/tag/tauri-v1.0.6", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0088.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39215", "GHSA-28m8-9j7v-x499"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "26f5e6b7-9f86-3dc6-a7dc-27d7a59ee067", "product": {"name": "tauri"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db6a5d26-619d-3a7f-a421-7cf8106eabda", "vendor": {"name": "tauri-apps"}}], "isExploited": false}
