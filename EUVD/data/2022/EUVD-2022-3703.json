For example, a low-privileged \u201cauthor\u201d role account can view these details in the JSON response for an \u201ceditor\u201d or \u201csuper admin\u201d that has updated one of the author\u2019s blog posts. There are also many other scenarios where such details from other users can leak in the JSON response, either through a direct or indirect relationship. Access to this information enables a user to compromise other users\u2019 accounts by successfully invoking the password reset workflow. In a worst-case scenario, a low-privileged user could get access to a \u201csuper admin\u201d account with full control over the Strapi instance, and could read and modify any data as well as block access to both the admin panel and API by revoking privileges for all other users.", "datePublished": "2022-05-19T17:07:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:56:12", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30617", "https://github.com/strapi/strapi", "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-strapi"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-30617", "GHSA-f6fm-r26q-p747"], "assigner": "SNPS", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3a00fa4b-c122-326d-881f-2674fac09b14", "product": {"name": "Strapi"}, "product_version": "! 4.0.0"}, {"id": "f43d1c30-2e8c-35b6-88f2-f933ffb09135", "product": {"name": "Strapi"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.0-beta.16"}, {"id": "fda4e85d-8a53-36de-98ee-d6537ee212d1", "product": {"name": "Strapi"}, "product_version": "< 3.6.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "64163458-cf3b-3a3e-b48b-7df851a5d035", "vendor": {"name": "strapi"}}], "isExploited": false}
