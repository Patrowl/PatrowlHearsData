It allows use of an external user/group database stored in LDAP. The connection configuration allows the usage of unencrypted, SSL- or TLS-secured connections. Unfortunately, the Graylog client code (in all versions that support LDAP) does not implement proper certificate validation (regardless of whether the \"Allow self-signed certificates\" option is used). Therefore, any attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic between a Graylog server and an LDAP server is able to redirect traffic to a different LDAP server (unnoticed by the Graylog server due to the lack of certificate validation), effectively bypassing Graylog's authentication mechanism.", "datePublished": "2020-07-17T18:05:06", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T13:30:21", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15813", "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/issues/5906", "https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/pull/8569"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-15813", "GHSA-3gg9-f3vh-866f"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55a9c7fa-a3da-37b6-9a69-bb95767fbe8f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4bd92bb0-a92a-32dc-b911-5224ee21374e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
