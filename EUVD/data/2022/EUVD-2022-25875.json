This vulnerability is due to improper handling of Cisco Discovery Protocol messages that are processed by the Cisco Discovery Protocol service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco Discovery Protocol service to fail and restart. In rare conditions, repeated failures of the process could occur, which could cause the entire device to restart.", "datePublished": "2022-02-23T17:40:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:29:50", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cdp-dos-G8DPLWYG"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20625"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e22c0a76-e743-34ad-96b2-817960153627", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5533a20f-8cdd-358c-8376-1fcc17d328b3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
