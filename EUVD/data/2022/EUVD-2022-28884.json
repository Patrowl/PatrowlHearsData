There is a permanent denial of service because image parsing causes a reboot, but image parsing is restarted as soon as the boot process finishes. However, this boot loop can be resolved by a field technician. The TIFF file must have an incomplete Image Directory. Affected firmware versions include xx.42.01 and xx.50.61. NOTE: the 2022-01-24 NeoSmart article included \"believed to affect all previous and later versions as of the date of this posting\" but a 2022-01-26 vendor statement reports \"the latest versions of firmware are not vulnerable to this issue.\"", "datePublished": "2022-01-26T05:01:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T03:59:23", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://neosmart.net/blog/2022/xerox-vulnerability-allows-unauthenticated-network-users-to-remotely-brick-printers/", "https://twitter.com/mqudsi/status/1485756915187695618"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23968"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4bf139f7-d1a8-3718-8425-efb07f08c07e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22759743-af33-348b-aedf-0052a13a10c9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
