In ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with 0.7.0 and prior to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. This issue is fixed in ReactPHP HTTP version 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any unexpected `Cookie` request headers.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T18:20:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:14:48", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/reactphp/http/security/advisories/GHSA-w3w9-vrf5-8mx8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36032", "https://github.com/reactphp/http/pull/175", "https://github.com/reactphp/http/commit/663c9a3b77b71463fa7fcb76a6676ffd16979dd6", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/react/http/CVE-2022-36032.yaml", "https://github.com/reactphp/http", "https://github.com/reactphp/http/releases/tag/v1.7.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36032", "GHSA-w3w9-vrf5-8mx8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "91a6ad83-a1cb-3700-9aaa-8f849662e8a0", "product": {"name": "http"}, "product_version": "0.7.0, < 1.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f88bdb8-ac46-3911-a05a-a5fb445e242b", "vendor": {"name": "reactphp"}}], "isExploited": false}
