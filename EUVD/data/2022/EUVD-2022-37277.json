The attacker needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Notify Users About Modification menu and the Notifications feature. A user can send malicious notifications and execute JavaScript code in the browser of every user who has enabled notifications. This is a stored XSS, and can lead to privilege escalation in the context of the application. (Another issue is present in the Favorites tab. The name of a favorite or a folder of favorites is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a self-XSS.)", "datePublished": "2023-01-01T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T09:07:16", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.synacktiv.com/sites/default/files/2022-12/sage_sei_multiple_xss.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-34322"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6be955c9-5bf3-3c22-826a-3bbb7bc66723", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4316e43-8b97-3f0e-ac26-d3454c9e4c1d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
