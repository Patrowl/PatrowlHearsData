An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive, browser-based information. In some cases, it is also possible to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.", "datePublished": "2022-11-10T17:39:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T02:24:49", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-LATZYzxs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20835"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "380f65c8-b546-3da7-b931-1958db620751", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.2"}, {"id": "4030c80a-05b7-3f3f-a963-ef3ab7d36565", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.1"}, {"id": "5a3b64c7-b117-3236-bb69-5e2329e773e9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0"}, {"id": "ed4168ef-dadd-31f3-ab7a-ecf3123a20bc", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "79843ba2-6639-32c8-80ec-289672476efc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
