In versions 1.12.4 and prior, the `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node allows an improperly authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the network. The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node 1.12.5 has been updated to properly authenticate pool-upgrade transactions before any processing is performed by the request handler. The transactions are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution. As a workaround, endorsers should not create DIDs for untrusted users. A vulnerable ledger should configure `auth_rules` to prevent new DIDs from being written to the ledger until the network can be upgraded.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T16:30:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:14:59", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/commit/fe507474f77084faef4539101e2bbb4d508a97f5", "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/security/advisories/GHSA-r6v9-p59m-gj2p", "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/releases/tag/v1.12.5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31020", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/indy-node/PYSEC-2022-265.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31020", "GHSA-r6v9-p59m-gj2p", "PYSEC-2022-265"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f2c2d6a4-5968-338e-acd6-5b916dda3c5f", "product": {"name": "indy-node"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.12.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71036a4c-1484-3846-8cba-d50fee980933", "vendor": {"name": "Hyperledger"}}], "isExploited": false}
