There are multiple ways how guests can cause large memory allocations in xenstored: - - by issuing new requests to xenstored without reading the responses, causing the responses to be buffered in memory - - by causing large number of watch events to be generated via setting up multiple xenstore watches and then e.g. deleting many xenstore nodes below the watched path - - by creating as many nodes as allowed with the maximum allowed size and path length in as many transactions as possible - - by accessing many nodes inside a transaction", "datePublished": "2022-11-01T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-05T19:52:32", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-42317.html", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-326.txt", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-326.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZLI2NPNEH7CNJO3VZGQNOI4M4EWLNKPZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YZVXG7OOOXCX6VIPEMLFDPIPUTFAYWPE/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YTMITQBGC23MSDHUCAPCVGLMVXIBXQTQ/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42317", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YTMITQBGC23MSDHUCAPCVGLMVXIBXQTQ", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YZVXG7OOOXCX6VIPEMLFDPIPUTFAYWPE", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZLI2NPNEH7CNJO3VZGQNOI4M4EWLNKPZ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-42317"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "650d77bb-7b9a-36c9-b07a-140d754e5eb8", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
