The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.", "datePublished": "2017-04-18T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T15:11:47", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5662", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2546", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2547", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0319", "https://www.debian.org/security/2018/dsa-4215", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html", "https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2018-3678067.html", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2018-4258247.html", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2017-3236626.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97948", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038334", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5662.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-5662"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5662", "GHSA-qwgx-59jw-qfg9"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "178d256c-2c24-3af0-8b33-a49f1f4ff95f", "product": {"name": "Apache Batik"}, "product_version": "before 1.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f19db5d2-e466-3e4f-b77a-c573c9fb16c3", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
