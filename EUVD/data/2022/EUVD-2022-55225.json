As far as I can tell, there's no reason for the mutex to be\nheld while the gadget core calls a gadget driver's ->bind or ->unbind\nroutine, or while a UDC is being started or stopped.  (This accounts\nfor link #1 in the chain above, where the mutex is held while the\ndwc2_hsotg_udc is started as part of driver probing.)\n\nGadget drivers' ->disconnect callbacks are problematic.  Even though\nusb_gadget_disconnect() will now acquire the udc_mutex, there's a\nwindow in usb_gadget_bind_driver() between the times when the mutex is\nreleased and the ->bind callback is invoked.  If a disconnect occurred\nduring that window, we could call the driver's ->disconnect routine\nbefore its ->bind routine.  To prevent this from happening, it will be\nnecessary to prevent a UDC from connecting while it has no gadget\ndriver.  This should be done already but it doesn't seem to be;\ncurrently usb_gadget_connect() has no check for this.  Such a check\nwill have to be added later.\n\nSome degree of mutual exclusion is required in soft_connect_store(),\nwhich can dereference udc->driver at arbitrary times since it is a\nsysfs callback.  The solution here is to acquire the gadget's device\nlock rather than the udc_mutex.  Since the driver core guarantees that\nthe device lock is always held during driver binding and unbinding,\nthis will make the accesses in soft_connect_store() mutually exclusive\nwith any changes to udc->driver.\n\nLastly, it turns out there is one place which should hold the\nudc_mutex but currently does not: The function_show() routine needs\nprotection while it dereferences udc->driver.  The missing lock and\nunlock calls are added.", "datePublished": "2025-06-18T12:30:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T21:30:27", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1a065e4673cbdd9f222a05f85e17d78ea50c8d9c", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1016fc0c096c92dd0e6e0541daac7a7868169903", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49943"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-49943"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2063c3a5-cd04-3ba5-a16c-131be44c5d35", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f44b0b95d50fffeca036e1ba36770390e0b519dd <1a065e4673cbdd9f222a05f85e17d78ea50c8d9c"}, {"id": "a0cfbde9-59a0-3684-b022-7ad64631a5c9", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.19.7 <5.19.8"}, {"id": "d0d97053-de36-319c-ae51-1278c8f96f4e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "2191c00855b03aa59c20e698be713d952d51fc18 <1016fc0c096c92dd0e6e0541daac7a7868169903"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5886380b-5780-3b81-b153-549f32fb8bd9", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
