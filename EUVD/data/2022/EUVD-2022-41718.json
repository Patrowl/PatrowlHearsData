This occurs when an attacker supposedly resumes a previous TLS session. During the resumption Client Hello a Hello Retry Request must be triggered. Both Client Hellos are required to contain a list of duplicate cipher suites to trigger the buffer overflow. In total, two Client Hellos have to be sent: one in the resumed session, and a second one as a response to a Hello Retry Request message.", "datePublished": "2022-09-30T00:00:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-20T21:30:26", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/", "https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Oct/24", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169600/wolfSSL-Buffer-Overflow.html", "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/01/12/wolfssl-vulnerabilities-tlspuffin-fuzzing-ssh/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39173"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39173"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3331bf82-8b59-3bfc-b4c9-5acfdecc4fb2", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d1ec8b3a-0255-3184-9ccc-f5953e634606", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
