Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, a large response received by the viaduct WSClient can cause a DoS from memory exhaustion. The entire body of the response is being read into memory which could allow an attacker to send a request that returns a response with a large body. The consequence of the exhaustion is that the process which invokes a WSClient will be in a denial of service. The software is affected If users who are authenticated to the edge side connect to `cloudhub` from the edge side through WebSocket protocol. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-07-11T20:55:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:03:19", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-6wvc-6pww-qr4r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31080", "github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31080", "GHSA-6wvc-6pww-qr4r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "14c1bcdc-51f4-3859-a122-cb24bfbb9a57", "product": {"name": "kubeedge"}, "product_version": "1.10.0, < 1.10.2"}, {"id": "e0beb308-54ae-3ca1-806c-fc3f050b0604", "product": {"name": "kubeedge"}, "product_version": "= 1.11.0"}, {"id": "e286235b-e1b9-3c69-8a74-a75316b68843", "product": {"name": "kubeedge"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "45886ff1-b333-374a-b16b-0a1cb9aeec4b", "vendor": {"name": "kubeedge"}}], "isExploited": false}
