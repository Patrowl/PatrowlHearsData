This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of IPv4 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed packet out of an affected MPLS-enabled interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-10-10T20:43:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:49:31", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-mpls-dos-Ab4OUL3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20870"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5c80e760-ca1e-3978-9f0f-67456c7ba3a1", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7dfb2d9-0b5a-380b-84af-c19c75a4e9ca", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
