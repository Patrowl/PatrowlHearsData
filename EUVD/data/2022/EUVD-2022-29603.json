{"id": "EUVD-2022-29603", "enisaUuid": "659c4b1e-91aa-3eb9-90b9-37802aa8f691", "description": "wire-webapp is the web application interface for the wire messaging service. Insufficient escaping in markdown \u201ccode highlighting\u201d in the wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript. If a user receives and views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack. The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp 2022-03-30-production.0 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 or wire-server 2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches * The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-03-30-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. * On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag **2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552** or wire-server **2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0)**, so that their applications are no longer affected. ### Workarounds * No workarounds known ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory feel free to email us at [vulnerability-report@wire.com](mailto:vulnerability-report@wire.com) ### Credits We thank [Posix](https://twitter.com/po6ix) for reporting this vulnerability", "datePublished": "2022-04-20T17:55:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:33:44", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/security/advisories/GHSA-5568-rfh8-vmhq", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/commit/d14455252a949dc83f36d45e2babbdd9328af2a4", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/releases/tag/2022-03-30-production.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24799"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10996747-5a8c-36d1-905c-7917237af02d", "product": {"name": "wire-webapp"}, "product_version": "< 2022-03-30-production.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cbf54e46-019c-32c3-9fc3-3f9085976e1f", "vendor": {"name": "wireapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
