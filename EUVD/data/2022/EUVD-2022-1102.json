Starting version 1.0.0 and prior to version 1.3.3, a check was added if the destination file is under a destination directory. However, it is not enforced that `_baseDirectory` ends with slash. If the _baseDirectory is not slash terminated like `/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory, i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination directory constraints, the arbitrary file creation impact is limited and depends on the use case. Version 1.3.3 fixed this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-01-26T21:10:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:32:19", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32842", "https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib", "https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib/releases/tag/v1.3.3", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-125-sharpziplib", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2021-125-sharpziplib/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32842", "GHSA-mm6g-mmq6-53ff"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7f2647e3-6e3a-3c06-81aa-5ab1760c891f", "product": {"name": "SharpZipLib"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <1.0.0*"}, {"id": "cf06e061-954f-37a2-950f-47b643af1bf4", "product": {"name": "SharpZipLib"}, "product_version": "1.3.3 <1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7f765df1-84cd-360c-a2e8-0ffcc6713b60", "vendor": {"name": "icsharpcode"}}], "isExploited": false}
