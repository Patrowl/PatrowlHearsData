{"id": "EUVD-2022-25929", "enisaUuid": "7cb49f9f-4575-3698-abd9-c89bf22a2738", "description": "A vulnerability in the IPSec decryption routine of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to buffer exhaustion that occurs while traffic on a configured IPsec tunnel is being processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to an affected device that has a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1800 bytes or greater. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker may need access to the trusted network where the affected device is in order to send specific packets to be processed by the device. All network devices between the attacker and the affected device must support an MTU of 1800 bytes or greater. This access requirement could limit the possibility of a successful exploit.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:16:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:09:32", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-qfp-ipsec-GQmqvtqV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20679"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9650cad6-a090-3a5e-bb67-d0b00166f19b", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c21f32f4-a466-3a85-8eef-2be14e0d3e86", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
