FlyteConsole prior to version 0.52.0 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) when FlyteConsole is open to the general internet. An attacker can exploit any user of a vulnerable instance to access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs. Passing of headers to an unauthorized actor may occur. The patch for this issue deletes the entire `cors_proxy`, as this is not required for console anymore. A patch is available in FlyteConsole version 0.52.0. Disable FlyteConsole availability on the internet as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-05-17T15:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:25:36", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/security/advisories/GHSA-www6-hf2v-v9m9", "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/pull/389", "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/commit/05b88ed2d2ecdb5d8a8404efea25414e57189709", "https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole/releases/tag/v0.52.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24856"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 86.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9690bd83-008b-3123-8a87-85a234388c05", "product": {"name": "flyteconsole"}, "product_version": "< 0.52.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4d73f73-e8f4-316d-a651-d1de7c4ef999", "vendor": {"name": "flyteorg"}}], "isExploited": false}
