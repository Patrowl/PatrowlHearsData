During the ACME enrollment process, an order is submitted containing an identifier for one or multiple dnsNames. These are validated properly in the ACME challenge. However, if the validation passes, a non-compliant client can include additional dnsNames the CSR sent to the finalize endpoint, resulting in EJBCA issuing a certificate including the identifiers that were not validated. This occurs even if the certificate profile is configured to not allow a DN override by the CSR.", "datePublished": "2022-09-14T02:58:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T09:22:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.primekey.com/products/ejbca-enterprise/", "https://support.keyfactor.com/s/detail/a6x1Q000000CwC5QAK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-34831"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6da1134e-42c4-3341-ae7e-34d571f6387e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d880d85-efc3-32d1-9561-d7104c25e6dd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
