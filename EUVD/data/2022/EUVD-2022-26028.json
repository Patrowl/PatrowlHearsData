This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the authentication component of Cisco Webex Meetings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-04-21T18:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:23:40", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-xss-w47AMqAk"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20778"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3c559c8-7c26-3ea4-a60a-3269f114515d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fbee05d9-8a2d-3fe3-9014-6f1d79f5b932", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
