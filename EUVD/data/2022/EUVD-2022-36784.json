The now wrong use of the variable did lead to a wrong TLB flush condition, omitting flushes where such are necessary.", "datePublished": "2022-07-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T08:09:22", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-33745.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5272", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-408.txt", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-408.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/2", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/26/3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HUFIMNGYP5VQAA6KE3T2I5GW6UP6F7BS/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MYI3OMJ7RIZNL3C6GUWNANNPEUUID6FM/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-33745"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ebda0f1d-63fd-3d4e-a7ff-2ed43d68558d", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
