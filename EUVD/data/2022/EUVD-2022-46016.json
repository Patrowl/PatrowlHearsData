A fault injection attack on RAM via Rowhammer leads to ECDSA key disclosure. Users performing signing operations with private ECC keys, such as in server-side TLS connections, might leak faulty ECC signatures. These signatures can be processed via an advanced technique for ECDSA key recovery. (In 5.5.0 and later, WOLFSSL_CHECK_SIG_FAULTS can be used to address the vulnerability.)", "datePublished": "2022-10-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T13:19:05", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/releases/tag/v5.5.0-stable"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-42961"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ae8dfa66-cb6a-3a34-b8ff-731d8009f875", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bc53b732-88e2-3c7d-a654-00bb67ee8926", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
