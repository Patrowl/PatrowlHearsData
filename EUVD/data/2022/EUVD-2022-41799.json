GoCD helps you automate and streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to remote code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent. The Spring RemoteInvocation endpoint exposed agent communication and allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects, as well as subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level authentication, thus an attacker would need to either compromise an existing agent, its network communication or register a new agent to practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-10-14T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:49:45", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-2hjh-3p3p-8hcm", "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/7b88b70d6f7f429562d5cab49a80ea856e34cdc8", "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#21-1-0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39311"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 6.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9cfd03a8-0445-3963-bf35-225ff4d4e24d", "product": {"name": "gocd"}, "product_version": "< 21.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "38890229-12f2-3a64-bf2d-38aeefa177bf", "vendor": {"name": "gocd"}}], "isExploited": false}
