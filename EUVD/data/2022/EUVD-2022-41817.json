Prior to version 6.1.12, the USB DFU UPLOAD functionality may be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is `UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 6.1.12. As a workaround, add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH` check in all possible states.", "datePublished": "2022-11-04T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T16:08:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-m9p8-xrp7-vvqp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39344"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a13a182-2dae-35ca-8c05-3b079b2bc47c", "product": {"name": "usbx"}, "product_version": "< 6.1.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "778dd52c-7945-393a-9a51-3ffdbea81979", "vendor": {"name": "azure-rtos"}}], "isExploited": false}
