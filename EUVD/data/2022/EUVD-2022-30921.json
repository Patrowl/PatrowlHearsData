This scheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen. Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before writeability is prohibited.", "datePublished": "2022-06-09T12:50:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T05:03:32", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-26362.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5184", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-401.txt", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-401.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/09/3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OH65U6FTTB5MLH5A6Q3TW7KVCGOG4MYI/", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167718/Xen-TLB-Flush-Bypass.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKRXZ4LHGCGMOG24ZCEJNY6R2BTS4S2Q/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-26362"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd0c143f-ec72-341e-9f64-a16466409c8d", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
