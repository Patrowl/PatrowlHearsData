These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2022-07-21T03:45:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T19:00:19", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rce-overflow-ygHByAK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20874"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a286e69b-2a1a-348e-9fc5-4ea744fca16b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f6a08209-b21c-30e3-9a0a-f413291046d7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
