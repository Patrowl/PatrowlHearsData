These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-01-14T05:05:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:32:59", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-csm-mult-xss-7hmOKQTt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20637"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3dc3167b-8dc4-3da0-8feb-a292bc9a84f6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Security Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9388131-d04b-3907-950b-591ea599323d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
