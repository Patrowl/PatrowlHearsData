Versions of `underscore.deep` prior to version 0.5.3 are vulnerable to a prototype pollution vulnerability. An attacker can craft a malicious payload and pass it to `deepFromFlat`, which would pollute any future Objects created. Any users that have `deepFromFlat` or `deepPick` (due to its dependency on `deepFromFlat`) in their code should upgrade to version 0.5.3 as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate this issue by modifying `deepFromFlat` to prevent specific keywords which will prevent this from happening.", "datePublished": "2022-06-28T17:30:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:53:07", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/security/advisories/GHSA-8j79-hfj5-f2xm", "https://github.com/Clever/underscore.deep/commit/b5e109ad05b48371be225fa4d490dd08a94e8ef7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31106"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fbcb2bbd-6d68-38c0-9baa-0e0f7abfaeb4", "product": {"name": "underscore.deep"}, "product_version": "< 0.5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "230c6ea8-aadf-3b2a-b878-88e46df4fd2b", "vendor": {"name": "Clever"}}], "isExploited": false}
