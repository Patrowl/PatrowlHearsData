In @podium/layout prior to version 4.6.110 and @podium/proxy prior to version 4.2.74, an attacker using the `Trailer` header as part of the request against proxy endpoints has the ability to take down the server. All Podium layouts that include podlets with proxy endpoints are affected. `@podium/layout`, which is the main way developers/users are vulnerable to this exploit, has been patched in version `4.6.110`. All earlier versions are vulnerable.`@podium/proxy`, which is the source of the vulnerability and is used by `@podium/layout` has been patched in version `4.2.74`. All earlier versions are vulnerable. It is not easily possible to work around this issue without upgrading.", "datePublished": "2022-04-06T17:15:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:41:18", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/podium-lib/proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-3hjg-vc7r-rcrw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24822", "https://github.com/podium-lib/layout/commit/fe43e655432b0a5f07b6475f67babcc2588fb039", "https://github.com/podium-lib/proxy/commit/9698a40df081217ce142d4de71f929baaa339cdf", "https://github.com/podium-lib/layout/releases/tag/v4.6.110", "https://github.com/podium-lib/proxy/releases/tag/v4.2.74"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24822", "GHSA-3hjg-vc7r-rcrw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.83, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "412d8c3e-d299-3242-87c1-566c1213fd84", "product": {"name": "proxy"}, "product_version": "< 4.2.74"}, {"id": "f673146b-9512-3336-bd63-e5eec55a794f", "product": {"name": "proxy"}, "product_version": "< 4.6.110"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "93a61f8e-b705-3707-ae00-c81c15d61727", "vendor": {"name": "podium-lib"}}], "isExploited": false}
