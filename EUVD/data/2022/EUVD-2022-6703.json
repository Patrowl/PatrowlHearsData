SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP. In SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time. This issue has been fixed in version 2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it.", "datePublished": "2022-09-02T17:15:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:24:43", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/security/advisories/GHSA-54qx-8p8w-xhg8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36071", "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/issues/965", "https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36071", "GHSA-54qx-8p8w-xhg8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f6ee403d-90a5-3d4e-8054-f2cab9e887a4", "product": {"name": "sftpgo"}, "product_version": "2.2.0, < 2.3.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "595fbda6-f0d4-3822-96a3-bfd79abbee44", "vendor": {"name": "drakkan"}}], "isExploited": false}
