When `MaxPool` receives a window size input array `ksize` with dimensions greater than its input tensor `input`, the GPU kernel gives a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-09-16T21:35:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:02:06", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-j43h-pgmg-5hjq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35989", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.10.0", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-35989.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35989", "GHSA-j43h-pgmg-5hjq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29942a6b-ea1d-3073-8636-abfc62847088", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.8.0, < 2.8.1"}, {"id": "37f0ddf1-e323-3c98-a52c-29afecab4547", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.2"}, {"id": "5e26bb7d-4e08-3ec5-9344-cdc4614aa3df", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.9.0, < 2.9.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e29f780-f2f1-32d8-8e5e-137145ff64f2", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
