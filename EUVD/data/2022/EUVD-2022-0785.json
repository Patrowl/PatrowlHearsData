Starting with version 1.14.0 and prior to version 1.27.0, Prism's command line plugin can be used by attackers to achieve a cross-site scripting attack. The command line plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code. Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command Line plugin are also not impacted. This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0. As a workaround, do not use the command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitize all code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the command line plugin.", "datePublished": "2022-02-18T14:50:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:02:44", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23647", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/3341", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/commit/e002e78c343154e1c0ddf9d6a0bb85689e1a5c7c", "https://github.com/PrismJS/prism", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6835", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8524"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23647", "GHSA-3949-f494-cm99"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d8bb6730-5a0b-3ef3-ad54-cd72108b1cc6", "product": {"name": "prism"}, "product_version": "1.14.0, < 1.27.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6b6b15c7-e9a7-3291-a861-509e3eeaf8ed", "vendor": {"name": "PrismJS"}}], "isExploited": false}
