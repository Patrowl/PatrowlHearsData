This also affects all applications that bundle Electron code equivalent to 1.6.8 or earlier. Bypassing the Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a precondition; however, recent Electron versions do not have strict SOP enforcement. Combining an SOP bypass with a privileged URL internally used by Electron, it was possible to execute native Node.js primitives in order to run OS commands on the user's host. Specifically, a chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html window could be used to eval a Node.js child_process.execFile API call.", "datePublished": "2017-08-06T02:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T18:43:56", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12581", "https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/05b6d91bf4c1e0ee65eeef70cd5d1bd1df125644", "https://blog.doyensec.com/2017/08/03/electron-framework-security.html", "https://doyensec.com/resources/us-17-Carettoni-Electronegativity-A-Study-Of-Electron-Security.pdf", "https://github.com/electron/electron"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-12581", "GHSA-7fv9-m79r-j9x8"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.85, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f31cd995-8279-3c4c-afed-56abade1279d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da6c66bb-d33f-3332-af81-bd729b51f7b5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
