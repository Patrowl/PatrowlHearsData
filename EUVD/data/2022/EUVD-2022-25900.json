The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user supplied data that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the NX-API of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.
