In versions prior to 4.1.0 a command Injection vulnerability existed in the gitserver service, present in all Sourcegraph deployments. This vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation on the host parameter of the `/list-gitolite` endpoint. It was possible to send a crafted request to gitserver that would execute commands inside the container. Successful exploitation requires the ability to send local requests to gitserver. The issue is patched in version 4.1.0.", "datePublished": "2022-11-22T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:36:07", "baseScore": 7.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-pfm3-23mh-6xjp", "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/42553"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41942"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bf49a699-b3f0-32b1-8896-2f1bb80d816e", "product": {"name": "sourcegraph"}, "product_version": "< 4.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d56800b-b9ba-3ab5-9509-9078f7edc90d", "vendor": {"name": "sourcegraph"}}], "isExploited": false}
