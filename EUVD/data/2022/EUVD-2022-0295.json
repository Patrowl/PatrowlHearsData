The implementation of `ThreadPoolHandle` can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by allocating too much memory. This is because the `num_threads` argument is only checked to not be negative, but there is no upper bound on its value. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "datePublished": "2022-02-03T11:21:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T15:58:59", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e3749a6d5d1e8d11806d4a2e9cc3123d1a90b75e", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-c582-c96p-r5cq", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/threadpool_dataset_op.cc#L79-L135", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21732", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2022-56.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2022-111.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-21732.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21732", "GHSA-c582-c96p-r5cq", "PYSEC-2022-56"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8f376829-3ea2-3266-b188-a287b06b4389", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c71c022-04bf-3b4d-89d9-8f0a3fa4ddbe", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
