These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-05-27T14:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:15:06", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-multi-xss-tyDFjhwb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20666"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22ae09f2-0ddc-31d6-9897-1e89bf5622bf", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d562dc33-6f6d-3787-a820-ff92f817d0e1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
