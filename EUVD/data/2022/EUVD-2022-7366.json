In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has \"deps: qs@6.9.7\" in its release description, is not vulnerable).", "datePublished": "2022-11-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T04:29:01", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24999", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/4310742efbd8c03f6495f07906b45213da0a32ec", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/727ef5d34605108acb3513f72d5435972ed15b68", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/73205259936317b40f447c5cdb71c5b341848e1b", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/8b4cc14cda94a5c89341b77e5fe435ec6c41be2d", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/ba24e74dd17931f825adb52f5633e48293b584e1", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/e799ba57e573a30c14b67c1889c7c04d508b9105", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/ed0f5dcbef4b168a8ae299d78b1e4a2e9b1baf1f", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/f945393cfe442fe8c6e62b4156fd35452c0686ee", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/commit/fc3682776670524a42e19709ec4a8138d0d7afda", "https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs", "https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0050", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-24999.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0612", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0794", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0934", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0930", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0932", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230908-0005/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24999", "GHSA-hrpp-h998-j3pp"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ac0d6e18-a0b5-34a0-aebd-2eafa554e9a5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2fef37eb-8ad8-3c63-a7d2-35d444fc8f1a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
