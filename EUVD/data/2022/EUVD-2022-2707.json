First, the attacker can write code in the editor, and compile and run it approximately three times to read an arbitrary file. Second, the attacker can create a symlink, and then place the symlink into a ZIP archive. An unzip operation leads to read access, and write access (depending on file permissions), to the symlink target. Third, the attacker can import a Git repository that contains a symlink, similarly leading to read and write access.", "datePublished": "2019-07-18T14:24:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:05:43", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13915", "https://github.com/b3log/wide/issues/355", "https://github.com/b3log/wide", "https://sca.analysiscenter.veracode.com/vulnerability-database/security/arbitrary-file-reads-and-writes/go/sid-20862", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190522035724/https://github.com/b3log/wide"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13915", "GHSA-6452-jr93-r5qm"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "635f44a7-eda9-360e-85f5-eeb4a1f39319", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9dedbb9a-f43f-3acf-9b2f-92b575a51fd0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
