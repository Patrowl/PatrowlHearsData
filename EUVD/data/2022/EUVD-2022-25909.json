This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-02-17T15:00:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:30:26", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-pi-epnm-xss-P8fBz2FW"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20659"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6d887e93-13d2-3fd2-8cd9-73f1d236299b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7211063c-c015-3498-a128-5698619e0206", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
