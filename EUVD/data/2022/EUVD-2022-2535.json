Drupal core did not previously provide this protection, allowing an access bypass vulnerability to occur. This issue is mitigated by the fact that in order to be affected, the site must allow anonymous users to upload files into a private file system.", "datePublished": "2019-01-22T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:04:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-6922", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/drupal/core/CVE-2017-6922.yaml", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/drupal/drupal/CVE-2017-6922.yaml", "https://github.com/drupal/core", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3897", "https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2017-003", "https://www.drupal.org/forum/newsletters/security-advisories-for-drupal-core/2017-06-21/drupal-core-multiple", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99219", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038781", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2017-6922.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-6922", "GHSA-58f3-cx8p-h8jg"], "assigner": "drupal", "epss": 2.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "78c72e0d-b246-398d-901e-5260796f52ef", "product": {"name": "drupal core"}, "product_version": "Drupal 8 <8.3.3"}, {"id": "976c59ea-b439-369a-a01a-0a9a5597c955", "product": {"name": "drupal core"}, "product_version": "Drupal 7 <7.55"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5dadfac2-9c83-3348-bcca-35e0aeafe1ec", "vendor": {"name": "Drupal"}}], "isExploited": false}
