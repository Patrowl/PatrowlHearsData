Under certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.", "datePublished": "2022-02-04T22:32:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:24:19", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-rww7-2gpw-fv6j", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L168-L174", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23572", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-cpu/PYSEC-2022-81.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/tensorflow-gpu/PYSEC-2022-136.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23572.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23572", "GHSA-rww7-2gpw-fv6j", "PYSEC-2022-81"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "63096bde-5829-367f-a36e-aca54c7a5dff", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.7.0, < 2.7.1"}, {"id": "6ddf6dc0-dac9-3b48-99b4-dcab085d47ad", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.5.3"}, {"id": "b8ed6ce1-e907-3220-be29-f9861ba05b18", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.6.0, < 2.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4d545c87-2f00-3a55-bee3-1c69b78fdd6a", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
