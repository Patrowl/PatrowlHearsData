The 6LoWPAN implementation in Contiki-NG may cast a UDP header structure at a certain offset in a packet buffer. The code does not check whether the packet buffer is large enough to fit a full UDP header structure from the offset where the casting is made. Hence, it is possible to cause an out-of-bounds read beyond the packet buffer. The problem affects anyone running devices with Contiki-NG versions previous to 4.8, and which may receive 6LoWPAN packets from external parties. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG version 4.8.", "datePublished": "2022-09-01T12:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:32:59", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1648", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-vwr8-6mqv-x7f5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36052"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "af5a1553-1bd4-3d27-88f3-1060bf3285a5", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "598f18de-599c-3907-b59e-3c43a9280e84", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
