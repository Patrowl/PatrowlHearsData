In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.", "datePublished": "2022-04-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:15:17", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/security/advisories/GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79", "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/pull/740", "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/issues/329", "https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/releases/tag/1.27.5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24859", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pypdf2/PYSEC-2022-194.yaml", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/06/msg00001.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00013.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-24859.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-24859.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24859", "GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79", "PYSEC-2022-194"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c850ba9a-ca0f-3d2d-94fe-f200f4978723", "product": {"name": "PyPDF2"}, "product_version": "< 1.27.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f6059275-eb7e-3bd1-9015-d32c0eef09d9", "vendor": {"name": "py-pdf"}}], "isExploited": false}
