The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.", "datePublished": "2017-04-18T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T15:11:48", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5661", "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-14", "https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html", "http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3864", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97947", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-5661.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3864", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-5661", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-5661"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-5661", "GHSA-5hg8-r9vq-gjqp"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 2.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3557ba77-9917-396e-aff1-acec263d5085", "product": {"name": "Apache FOP"}, "product_version": "before 2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "332af7fe-3b47-3d52-a57f-9d304a8cf122", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
