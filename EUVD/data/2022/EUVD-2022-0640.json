Domains configured with interactsh server prior to version 1.0.0 were vulnerable to subdomain takeover for a specific subdomain, i.e `app.` Interactsh server used to create cname entries for `app` pointing to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default, which intended to used for hosting interactsh web client using GitHub pages. This is a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server in which the user may not have configured a web client but still have a CNAME entry pointing to GitHub pages, making them vulnerable to subdomain takeover. This allows a threat actor to host / run arbitrary client side code (cross-site scripting) in a user's browser when browsing the vulnerable subdomain. Version 1.0.0 fixes this issue by making CNAME optional, rather than default.", "datePublished": "2023-06-28T21:20:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T17:16:00", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/security/advisories/GHSA-m36x-mgfh-8g78", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36474", "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/issues/136", "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh/pull/155", "https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh", "https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more", "https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-36474", "GHSA-m36x-mgfh-8g78"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.86, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b7afb42-8681-3721-8a72-53536b012087", "product": {"name": "interactsh"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a88a78f-3b50-3e8e-aef8-7a0808373c0b", "vendor": {"name": "projectdiscovery"}}], "isExploited": false}
