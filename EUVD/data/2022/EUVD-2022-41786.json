This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute when a user views the specific log on the \"view=log\" page. This vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable database logging.", "datePublished": "2022-10-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:19:26", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/security/advisories/GHSA-h6xp-cvwv-q433", "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/commit/c0a4c05e84eea0f6ccf7169c014efe5422c9ba0d", "https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zoneminder/commit/d289eb48601a76e34feea3c1683955337b1fae59", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/171498/Zoneminder-Log-Injection-XSS-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39285"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ab87347-8adc-3d3f-994a-8723c72a516d", "product": {"name": "zoneminder"}, "product_version": "< 1.36.27"}, {"id": "a871b53b-eac4-33d2-bd20-46baeacd349d", "product": {"name": "zoneminder"}, "product_version": "1.37.0, < 1.37.24"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71601c61-332b-318a-ad6b-a7510985b4cd", "vendor": {"name": "ZoneMinder"}}], "isExploited": false}
