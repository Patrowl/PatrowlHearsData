An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted SIP traffic through an interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a restart of the Snort 3 process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2022-11-10T17:32:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T21:05:42", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftdsnort3sip-dos-A4cHeArC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20950"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c4a66c52-4f50-3f62-af99-d4f53d7a5ab3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.0.1"}, {"id": "e75da01a-01a5-3619-80e5-eaade101c3dc", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db4bd892-3aea-3ebe-aba4-b8956e4433ef", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
