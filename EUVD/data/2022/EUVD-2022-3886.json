An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is {A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a, such as the backtick character.", "datePublished": "2021-10-21T14:46:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T03:38:50", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42740", "https://github.com/ljharb/shell-quote/commit/5799416ed454aa4ec9afafc895b4e31760ea1abe", "https://github.com/ljharb/shell-quote", "https://github.com/ljharb/shell-quote/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#173", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/shell-quote", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-42740.html", "https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#173", "https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote/commit/5799416ed454aa4ec9afafc895b4e31760ea1abe"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-42740", "GHSA-g4rg-993r-mgx7"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cbbddffd-8ee2-3c81-917e-a5bcd229133d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ffd1fe48-1921-3ea2-9787-e85064b5ac7a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
