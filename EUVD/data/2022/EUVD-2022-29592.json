This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.", "datePublished": "2022-04-12T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-16T17:47:44", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2022-24765", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-24765.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-24765", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-24765.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2022-24765.html", "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-vw2c-22j4-2fh2", "https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-Bash", "https://git-scm.com/docs/git#Documentation/git.txt-codeGITCEILINGDIRECTORIEScode", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/12/7", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PTN5NYEHYN2OQSHSAMCNICZNK2U4QH6/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BENQYTDGUL6TF3UALY6GSIEXIHUIYNWM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SLP42KIZ6HACTVZMZLJLFJQ4W2XYT27M/", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213261", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/May/31", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TRZG5CDUQ27OWTPC5MQOR4UASNXHWEZS/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DDI325LOO2XBDDKLINOAQJEG6MHAURZE/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DIKWISWUDFT2FAITYIA6372BVLH3OOOC/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YROCMBWYFKRSS64PO6FUNM6L7LKBUKVW/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HVOLER2PIGMHPQMDGG4RDE2KZB74QLA2/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UDZRZAL7QULOB6V7MKT66MOMWJLBJPX4/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24765"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "43a89cfb-fba1-322d-b953-493373a77a02", "product": {"name": "Git"}, "product_version": "< 2.35.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "905173d1-5b85-3c5a-856f-97e96c337c1b", "vendor": {"name": "git-for-windows"}}], "isExploited": false}
