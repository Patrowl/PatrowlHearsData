In versions before 6.2.0, the Fault Tolerant feature of Azure RTOS FileX includes integer under and overflows which may be exploited to achieve buffer overflow and modify memory contents. When a valid log file with correct ID and checksum is detected by the `_fx_fault_tolerant_enable` function an attempt to recover the previous failed write operation is taken by call of `_fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs`. This function iterates through the log entries and performs required recovery operations. When properly crafted a log including entries of type `FX_FAULT_TOLERANT_DIR_LOG_TYPE` may be utilized to introduce unexpected behavior. This issue has been patched in version 6.2.0. A workaround to fix line 218 in fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c is documented in the GHSA.", "datePublished": "2022-11-08T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T16:08:01", "baseScore": 5.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/filex/security/advisories/GHSA-8jqf-wjhq-4w9f", "https://github.com/azure-rtos/filex/blob/master/common/src/fx_fault_tolerant_apply_logs.c#L218"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39343"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6715f2d7-ca45-3bfa-9b48-05cd46545f85", "product": {"name": "filex"}, "product_version": "< 6.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94f2a0eb-5f0f-3690-bbd5-ccaf33c07c20", "vendor": {"name": "azure-rtos"}}], "isExploited": false}
