In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the set of certificates it accepts from the peer, either as a TLS client or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth, respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull request #630, in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2022-02-22T22:30:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:01:32", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-21657.html", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-837m-wjrv-vm5g", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/630"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21657"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a75b0b2-e606-3346-9e56-ae4af5dc89c0", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "< 1.18.6"}, {"id": "600fecc6-1fe3-32ba-9f49-6ab0bdf858db", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.19.0, < 1.19.3"}, {"id": "d55d0167-93e4-3343-94b7-de4bb23f626f", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.20.0, < 1.20.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1b9ad4d2-c032-3dbd-b69c-9f6ed7aa63af", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
