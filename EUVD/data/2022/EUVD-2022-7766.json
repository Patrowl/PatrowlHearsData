A `ProtoNode` may be modified in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB, attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded) `ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain states that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due to conformance with the [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-format#Block) and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node) interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if state has changed, will panic due to the inability to return an error. This issue has been addressed across a number of pull requests. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.8.1 for a complete set of fixes. Users unable to upgrade may attempt to mitigate this issue by sanitising inputs when allowing user-input to set a new `CidBuilder` on a `ProtoNode` and by sanitising `Tsize` (`Link#Size`) values such that they are a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from user-input.\n", "datePublished": "2022-12-08T21:25:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:31:04", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/security/advisories/GHSA-x39j-h85h-3f46", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23495", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/issues/90", "https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/issues/9297", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/91", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/92", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/pull/93", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/releases/tag/v0.8.0", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-merkledag/releases/tag/v0.8.1", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1155"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23495", "GHSA-x39j-h85h-3f46"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f48e1e50-8dd5-3f67-bccc-0c962ee96052", "product": {"name": "go-merkledag"}, "product_version": "0.4.0, < 0.8.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70162abb-0b8b-3cf2-b1ac-31de5fd885c1", "vendor": {"name": "IPFS"}}], "isExploited": false}
