In versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can generate smart contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in read only mode contract B and the called function will make changes upon the contract's B state, the state will be altered for contract B as if the call was not made in the read-only mode. This can lead to some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers. This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T20:35:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:24:16", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/security/advisories/GHSA-mv8x-668m-53fg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36061", "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go", "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/blob/8e402fa6d7e91e779980122d3798b2bf50892945/integrationTests/vm/txsFee/asyncESDT_test.go#L452", "https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go/releases/tag/v1.3.35"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36061", "GHSA-mv8x-668m-53fg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2498cc75-e6d1-365e-8b69-7ce6adc9783c", "product": {"name": "elrond-go"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.35"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4ec2289c-3c17-3379-ad8d-0ebc4e9890f1", "vendor": {"name": "ElrondNetwork"}}], "isExploited": false}
