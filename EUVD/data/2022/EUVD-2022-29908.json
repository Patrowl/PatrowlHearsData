A TOCTOU race condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files. This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of privilege or denial of service.", "datePublished": "2022-04-14T15:19:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T04:36:05", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/CVEs", "https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/cve-2022-25165-aws-vpn-client/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-25165"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.97, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12ed3ea7-acfc-3cd4-b919-b004f458aaa1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5918c1ad-1000-30c7-8b2b-71cdd38c083e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
