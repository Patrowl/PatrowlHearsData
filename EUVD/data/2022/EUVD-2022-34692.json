This is due to insufficient file type and path validation on the deleteFiles() function found in the ~/Admin/Menu/Packages.php file that triggers upon download post deletion. This makes it possible for contributor level users and above to supply an arbitrary file path via the 'file[files]' parameter when creating a download post and once the user deletes the post the supplied arbitrary file will be deleted. This can be used by attackers to delete the /wp-config.php file which will reset the installation and make it possible for an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the server.", "datePublished": "2022-09-07T00:01:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-21T18:31:19", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2762092%40download-manager&new=2762092%40download-manager&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167920/wpdownloadmanager3250-filedelete.txt", "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/08/high-severity-vulnerability-patched-in-download-manager-plugin/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2431"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2431"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 17.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "14ff301a-2127-3d16-8905-d7a79bf2a250", "product": {"name": "Download Manager"}, "product_version": "3.2.50 \u22643.2.50"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b6884784-77f9-373a-99ea-53c6b5200dbd", "vendor": {"name": "download-manager"}}], "isExploited": false}
