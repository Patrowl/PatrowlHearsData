When teler requests messages from the event stream on the `/events` endpoint, the log data displayed on the dashboard are not sanitized. This only affects authenticated users and can only be exploited based on detected threats if the log contains a DOM scripting payload. This vulnerability has been fixed on version `v2.0.0-rc.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2022-12-06T17:58:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:32:01", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/security/advisories/GHSA-xr7p-8q82-878q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23466", "https://github.com/kitabisa/teler/commit/20f59eda2420ac64e29f199a61230a0abc875e8e", "https://github.com/kitabisa/teler"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23466", "GHSA-xr7p-8q82-878q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "813a9d2e-a696-3d51-9a88-4e9ca5887a3a", "product": {"name": "teler"}, "product_version": "= v2.0.0-dev"}, {"id": "b4e41f64-3586-38d9-8234-78e6a45a51c8", "product": {"name": "teler"}, "product_version": "v2.0.0-rc, < v2.0.0-rc.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "58c0e866-ede9-38bd-a8b3-e62a80252dc6", "vendor": {"name": "kitabisa"}}], "isExploited": false}
