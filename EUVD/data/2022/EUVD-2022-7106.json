A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done. Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call came from a direct `STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`. For those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-10-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:43:37", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/security/advisories/GHSA-hhc4-47rh-cr34", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39354", "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/pull/133", "https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0083.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39354", "GHSA-hhc4-47rh-cr34"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2baddd8-d963-39ab-b7a0-eca56ee4f3fe", "product": {"name": "evm"}, "product_version": "< 0.36.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "40a219d5-4dce-3545-951b-1075f8be926a", "vendor": {"name": "rust-blockchain"}}], "isExploited": false}
