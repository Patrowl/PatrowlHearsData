When the --activationkey option is used with convert2rhel, the activation key is subsequently passed to subscription-manager via the command line, which could allow unauthorized users locally on the machine to view the activation key via the process command line via e.g. htop or ps. The specific impact varies upon the subscription, but generally this would allow an attacker to register systems purchased by the victim until discovered; a form of fraud. This could occur regardless of how the activation key is supplied to convert2rhel because it involves how convert2rhel provides it to subscription-manager.", "datePublished": "2022-08-29T14:03:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T23:40:04", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6266", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6268", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6269", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060217", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0851"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-0851"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a95bb26-d09b-30d0-b008-3281b2c0c33a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
