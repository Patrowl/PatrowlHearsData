There are many scenarios in which such details from API users can leak in the JSON response within the admin panel, either through a direct or indirect relationship. Access to this information enables a user to compromise these users\u2019 accounts if the password reset API endpoints have been enabled. In a worst-case scenario, a low-privileged user could get access to a high-privileged API account, and could read and modify any data as well as block access to both the admin panel and API by revoking privileges for all other users.", "datePublished": "2022-05-19T17:08:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:56:13", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30618", "https://github.com/strapi/strapi", "https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-strapi"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-30618", "GHSA-vgj7-895j-gpr6"], "assigner": "SNPS", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "18339c03-82a2-3c1c-aa8e-9807a6f1d0b9", "product": {"name": "Strapi"}, "product_version": "< 4.1.10"}, {"id": "f2c688f8-8180-3ac8-9e8d-ae47e69cc3d5", "product": {"name": "Strapi"}, "product_version": "< 3.6.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cdf96631-f833-327a-a6e6-179394033c16", "vendor": {"name": "strapi"}}], "isExploited": false}
