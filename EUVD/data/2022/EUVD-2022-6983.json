Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the channel. The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As a workaround operators may disable dynamic channel joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config.", "datePublished": "2022-09-13T18:15:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:11:08", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/security/advisories/GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39203", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc", "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity", "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39203", "GHSA-xvqg-mv25-rwvw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "543bd517-40c7-347c-a525-474b008a7b8c", "product": {"name": "matrix-appservice-irc"}, "product_version": "< 0.35.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ad09a8c-9c47-3f37-8616-816974ed68d8", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
