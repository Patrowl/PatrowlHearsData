If `LRNGrad` is given an `output_image` input tensor that is not 4-D, it results in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit bd90b3efab4ec958b228cd7cfe9125be1c0cf255. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-09-16T21:40:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:01:47", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-9942-r22v-78cp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35985", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/bd90b3efab4ec958b228cd7cfe9125be1c0cf255", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.10.0", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-35985.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35985", "GHSA-9942-r22v-78cp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "157b6fdf-c854-3bef-92f5-6dc2b388e8d6", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.2"}, {"id": "5ac6a862-527a-32fe-adeb-878769fe9df3", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.8.0, < 2.8.1"}, {"id": "fb2b7d8c-8158-3aa5-8e06-af1acf45aff0", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.9.0, < 2.9.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d16982a-b01f-390e-b6b4-ef0f7272c8ae", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
