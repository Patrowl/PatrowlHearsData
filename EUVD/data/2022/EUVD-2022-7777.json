Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS vulnerability that allows authenticated users to upload .html files. An attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another user opened a link. The attacker could potentially take over the account of the user that clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively expose such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the malicious link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to non image files via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory.", "datePublished": "2022-12-29T18:36:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T14:31:44", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gotify/server/security/advisories/GHSA-xv6x-456v-24xh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46181", "https://github.com/gotify/server/pull/534", "https://github.com/gotify/server/pull/535", "https://github.com/gotify/server"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-46181", "GHSA-xv6x-456v-24xh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db05475c-4020-3222-96b0-ac2b1d857cd3", "product": {"name": "Server"}, "product_version": "< 2.2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "453e8cbd-c7cd-396f-b778-4e57a45cfa99", "vendor": {"name": "gotify"}}], "isExploited": false}
