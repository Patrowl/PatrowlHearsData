However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-02-15T18:20:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:22:02", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/security/advisories/GHSA-qc84-gqf4-9926", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23639", "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/781", "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam", "https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/releases/tag/crossbeam-utils-0.8.7", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0041.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23639.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23639", "GHSA-qc84-gqf4-9926"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a7d01c1-5a2c-3f22-b7c0-4474102e4f1f", "product": {"name": "crossbeam"}, "product_version": "< 0.8.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2a4cb845-c9a5-304f-a055-8319c15ee507", "vendor": {"name": "crossbeam-rs"}}], "isExploited": false}
