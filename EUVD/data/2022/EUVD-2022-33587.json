In versions prior to 1.22.1 secompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression.", "datePublished": "2022-06-09T19:15:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:54:27", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5003", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-29225.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:5004", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-75hv-2jjj-89hh", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/cb4ef0b09200c720dfdb07e097092dd105450343"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29225"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10eed980-d751-33a7-b9c5-e54b4e7a9df6", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "< 1.22.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "612965ee-4e3d-32b9-bb82-262e7fd59166", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
