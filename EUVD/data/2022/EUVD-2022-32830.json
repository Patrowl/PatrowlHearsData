Due to missing integrity checks, an attacker can manipulate the content of the emulated CD-ROM drive (containing the Windows and macOS client software). The content of this emulated CD-ROM drive is stored as an ISO-9660 image in the hidden sectors of the USB drive, that can only be accessed using special IOCTL commands, or when installing the drive in an external disk enclosure. By manipulating this ISO-9660 image or replacing it with another one, an attacker is able to store malicious software on the emulated CD-ROM drive. This software may get executed by an unsuspecting victim when using the device. For example, an attacker with temporary physical access during the supply chain could program a modified ISO-9660 image on a device that always accepts an attacker-controlled password for unlocking the device. If the attacker later on gains access to the used USB drive, he can simply decrypt all contained user data. Storing arbitrary other malicious software is also possible. This affects Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1 and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.", "datePublished": "2022-06-08T15:39:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T05:56:15", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2022-013.txt", "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2022-017.txt", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Jun/23", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Jun/26", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167546/Verbatim-Executive-Fingerprint-Secure-SSD-GDMSFE01-INI3637-C-VER1.1-Insufficient-Verification.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167536/Verbatim-Fingerprint-Secure-Portable-Hard-Drive-53650-Insufficient-Verification.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-28385"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5cb0b940-ec96-3e2d-8567-e9199ee35fa9", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a6637e37-de17-3218-b11d-1a399981cdc5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
