It exposes an SSH interface on port 22/TCP. This interface is used for remote maintenance and for SFTP file-transfer operations that are part of engineering software functionality. Access to this interface is controlled by 5 preconfigured accounts (root, abuilder, acelogin, cappl, ace), all of which come with default credentials. Although the ACE1000 documentation mentions the root, abuilder and acelogin accounts and instructs users to change the default credentials, the cappl and ace accounts remain undocumented and thus are unlikely to have their credentials changed.", "datePublished": "2022-07-26T22:11:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:48:34", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-179-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-30270"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "74e28e7f-230a-3faf-9f5a-9aca41429d98", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e212187a-acd6-3c42-8afe-da5c633c548e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
