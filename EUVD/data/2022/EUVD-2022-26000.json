This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of an ingress TCP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP data to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the checkpoint manager process restarting.", "datePublished": "2022-02-17T15:00:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:30:18", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rcm-tcp-dos-2Wh8XjAQ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20750"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d8ac967c-0723-3449-8d61-67996260691f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Redundancy Configuration Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b2e2372d-b1ac-3589-95c5-b075b7ad2e00", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
