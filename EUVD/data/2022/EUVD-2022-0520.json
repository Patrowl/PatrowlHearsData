There is an unhandled case when reading POST requests which results in the server crashing if it could not read the body of a request. In the event that a POST request is sent to any endpoint of the server with an empty body, even unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol, it will crash the server. All users that run the server are affected by this vulnerability and it's highly recommended to upgrade to the latest patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-01-07T17:10:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:14:18", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/soketi/soketi/security/advisories/GHSA-86ch-6w7v-v6xf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21667", "https://github.com/soketi/soketi/commit/4b12efef9c31117c36a0a0f1c3aa32114e86364b", "https://github.com/soketi/soketi", "https://github.com/soketi/soketi/releases/tag/0.24.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21667", "GHSA-86ch-6w7v-v6xf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5a56c7a3-8d73-393c-91e4-052c48a3554b", "product": {"name": "soketi"}, "product_version": "< 0.24.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c482333-004c-36b7-808c-955f20853d16", "vendor": {"name": "soketi"}}], "isExploited": false}
