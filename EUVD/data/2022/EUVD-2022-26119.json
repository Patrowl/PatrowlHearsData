This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-08-10T08:10:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:55:26", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-broadworks-xss-xbhfr4cD"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20869"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c134d6b9-a042-3b3c-8376-1805a4752726", "product": {"name": "Cisco BroadWorks"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9ae7342-4a1d-318a-907e-2aa8c9db5b7e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
