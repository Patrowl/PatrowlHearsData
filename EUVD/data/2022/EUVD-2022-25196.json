Integer overflow in matroskademux element in lzo decompression function which causes a segfault, or could cause a heap overwrite, depending on libc and OS. Depending on the libc used, and the underlying OS capabilities, it could be just a segfault or a heap overwrite. If the libc uses mmap for large chunks, and the OS supports mmap, then it is just a segfault (because the realloc before the integer overflow will use mremap to reduce the size of the chunk, and it will start to write to unmapped memory). However, if using a libc implementation that does not use mmap, or if the OS does not support mmap while using libc, then this could result in a heap overwrite.", "datePublished": "2022-07-19T19:13:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:17:00", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1924.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5204", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-1924", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-1924.html", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/issues/1225", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/08/msg00001.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-1924"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5cb94b48-699d-3a18-abf7-1ecfea2cf33b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
