On sites with Patreon login enabled, an improper authentication vulnerability could be used to take control of a victim's forum account. This vulnerability is patched in commit number 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e of the discourse-patreon plugin. Out of an abundance of caution, any Discourse accounts which have logged in with an unverified-email Patreon account will be logged out and asked to verify their email address on their next login. As a workaround, disable the patreon integration and log out all users with associated Patreon accounts.", "datePublished": "2022-10-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:43:09", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/security/advisories/GHSA-fvj9-f67v-qpr4", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-patreon/commit/846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39355"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db563cd3-44b3-315b-a1e9-7ee21ae2891e", "product": {"name": "discourse-patreon"}, "product_version": "< 846d012151514b35ce42a1636c7d70f6dcee879e"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec744ac6-01d9-3f44-b571-02326188b64c", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
