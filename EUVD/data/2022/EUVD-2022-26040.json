This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2022-04-21T18:50:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:22:18", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucm-file-read-h8h4HEJ3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20790"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8aec479f-5645-31e1-835a-2a54a0dad142", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8923266b-08cb-3e84-a7cb-1da618351360", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
