With JWT, an attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported. The application can specify `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The issue is not that big as `algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` has to be used. Users should upgrade to v2.4.0 to receive a patch for this issue. As a workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and expected when decoding.", "datePublished": "2022-05-24T14:10:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:22:46", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/security/advisories/GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24", "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/commit/9c528670c455b8d948aff95ed50e22940d1ad3fc", "https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt/releases/tag/2.4.0", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HIYEYZRQEP6QTHT3EHH3RGFYJIHIMAO/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PK7IQCBVNLYJEFTPHBBPFP72H4WUFNX/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29217", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pyjwt/PYSEC-2022-202.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-29217.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-29217.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2022-29217", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-29217", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6HIYEYZRQEP6QTHT3EHH3RGFYJIHIMAO/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5PK7IQCBVNLYJEFTPHBBPFP72H4WUFNX/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29217", "GHSA-ffqj-6fqr-9h24", "PYSEC-2022-202"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d4ff69bd-16cf-3c69-986f-2268d957a302", "product": {"name": "pyjwt"}, "product_version": "1.5.0, < 2.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5308afb-c208-3ad2-82de-7c3932a962d0", "vendor": {"name": "jpadilla"}}], "isExploited": false}
