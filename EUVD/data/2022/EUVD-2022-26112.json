This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the operating system.", "datePublished": "2022-07-06T20:31:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:11:00", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucm-file-read-qgjhEc3A"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20862"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "875038db-bf9a-35ab-933c-4aded619d8b6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3e7d5a1e-e7fa-35b4-a018-1a417f7e6b24", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
