By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume, an attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS header, resulting in a denial of service attack on the compute host. (The same code error also results in data loss, but that is not a vulnerability because the user loses their own data.) All Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.", "datePublished": "2018-02-19T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T21:13:49", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18191", "https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/0225a61fc4557c1257383a654f0741f7ef2ddeac", "https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/5b64a1936122eeb35f37a09f9d38159e1a224c58", "https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/cd3eb60c2c00bcccfa9ccd4bf9d1a96ae7a5cd88", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2332", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2714", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2855", "https://github.com/openstack/nova", "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1739593", "https://review.openstack.org/539893", "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2018-001.html", "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/04/20/3", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103104", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-18191.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2017-18191"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-18191", "GHSA-ffmh-r67w-m88f"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b82cd5b0-3b46-3629-baf6-7a8b664da250", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "12a74b03-7bef-3e74-8616-5ceb83957087", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
