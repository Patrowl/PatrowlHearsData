Versions prior to 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone using translations with the view_component gem. Data received via user input and passed as an interpolation argument to the `translate` method is not properly sanitized before display. Versions 2.31.2 and 2.49.1 have been released and fully mitigate the vulnerability. As a workaround, avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.", "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:40:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:59:13", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/github/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24722", "https://github.com/github/view_component/commit/3f82a6e62578ff6f361aba24a1feb2caccf83ff9", "https://github.com/github/view_component", "https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.31.2", "https://github.com/github/view_component/releases/tag/v2.49.1", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/view_component/CVE-2022-24722.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24722", "GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0da6f8ab-0587-338b-bb75-76bb62f7586e", "product": {"name": "view_component"}, "product_version": "2.31.0, < 2.31.2"}, {"id": "a5c2925b-49e1-3c89-ae4c-363a40358aa8", "product": {"name": "view_component"}, "product_version": "2.32.0, < 2.49.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86ca085b-269f-394e-856e-6c4c19bb8576", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
