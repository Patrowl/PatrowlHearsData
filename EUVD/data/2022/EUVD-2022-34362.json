Because of that, an attacker could create a socket and connect with a remote IP:port by opening a shell and getting full access to the system. The exploit affects daemons dbmng and logsrv that are running on ports 8000 and 8001 by default.", "datePublished": "2022-09-23T15:06:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T18:07:56", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.incibe-cert.es/en/early-warning/security-advisories/buffer-overflow-vulnerabilities-grandstream-gsd3710"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2070"], "assigner": "INCIBE", "epss": 9.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "28a2d127-ff63-3bfc-83ae-4f841b9ab10a", "product": {"name": "Grandstream GSD3710"}, "product_version": "1.0.11.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "08a99808-b7eb-3b26-a31a-7bc592fb28f7", "vendor": {"name": "Grandstream"}}], "isExploited": false}
