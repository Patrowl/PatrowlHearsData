The scripts that handle the graphing options (html/includes/graphs/common.inc.php and html/includes/graphs/graphs.inc.php) do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some parameters are filtered with mysqli_real_escape_string, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the html/graph.php script. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files.", "datePublished": "2019-09-09T12:56:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:32:01", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10665", "https://github.com/spaceraccoon/CVE-2020-10665", "https://www.activecyber.us/activelabs/docker-desktop-local-privilege-escalation-cve-2020-10665", "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-rrdtool-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-023", "https://www.darkmatter.ae/xen1thlabs/librenms-rrdtool-injection-vulnerability-xl-19-023/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-10665", "GHSA-q5rg-wg7h-73m5"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19ab84a7-3e4e-3bdd-8d82-2570a3952ef1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ffaa4014-2071-34b3-a8d0-6da439852555", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
