Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1, paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.", "datePublished": "2022-03-01T20:20:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:59:31", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/0c99bc511533d48be17dc6bfe641f7d0aeb34d77", "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/commit/125e4474f910c1507f8ec3232848626fbc0f55c4", "https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/4718", "https://github.com/psf/requests/pull/4718", "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/security/advisories/GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4", "https://github.com/fluture-js/fluture-node/security/advisories/GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24719", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pyquest/PYSEC-2022-43051.yaml", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/request-util/PYSEC-2022-43052.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24719", "GHSA-32x6-qvw6-mxj4", "PYSEC-2022-43051"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9eef48b6-1164-3275-bfd2-e545f94d3594", "product": {"name": "fluture-node"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8018440-0430-34d5-b7b6-cf676530cdb4", "vendor": {"name": "fluture-js"}}], "isExploited": false}
