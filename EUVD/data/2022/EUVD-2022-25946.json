This vulnerability exists because the messaging server container ports on an affected system lack sufficient protection mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the messaging service ports of the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to send network traffic to interfaces within the VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted to protect logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and inject messages into the messaging service, which can cause configuration changes or cause the system to reload.", "datePublished": "2022-09-08T12:30:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:06:55", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-msg-serv-AqTup7vs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20696"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "70dcdb19-267a-320a-9e15-9dfd1565b871", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "121fc761-72bb-348e-a102-d5e064eea9ef", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
