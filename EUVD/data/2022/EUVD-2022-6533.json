Due to a missing authorization check, **Actions** were able to grant authorizations for projects that belong to other organizations inside the same Instance. Granting authorizations via API and Console is not affected by this vulnerability. There is currently no known workaround, users should update.", "datePublished": "2022-08-31T22:40:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:33:14", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-c8fj-4pm8-mp2c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36051", "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/4237", "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/4238", "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v1.87.1", "https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.2.0", "github.com/zitadel/zitadel"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36051", "GHSA-c8fj-4pm8-mp2c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "232b255d-aad1-34a5-9aad-8f7901eedbd0", "product": {"name": "zitadel"}, "product_version": "1.42.0, < 1.87.1"}, {"id": "66fb1853-f4e5-3408-9b15-1265ea2e5dcb", "product": {"name": "zitadel"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96989d78-5761-33c0-b39c-c7f9cc1115db", "vendor": {"name": "zitadel"}}], "isExploited": false}
