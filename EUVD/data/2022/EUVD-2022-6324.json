Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard API. The main application can set up `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.", "datePublished": "2022-07-11T18:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:03:51", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/security/advisories/GHSA-cr6p-23cf-w9g9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31139", "https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/commit/4ef83000184e8f13239a1ea2847ee401d81585fd", "https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor", "https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/releases/tag/1.7.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31139", "GHSA-cr6p-23cf-w9g9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ec6b05c7-b084-3286-be66-1a1edde96237", "product": {"name": "UnsafeAccessor"}, "product_version": "1.4.0, < 1.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2bdfe26e-83dd-3193-b0b5-3a788bc60cac", "vendor": {"name": "Karlatemp"}}], "isExploited": false}
