Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.", "datePublished": "2022-03-17T20:30:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:46:31", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-f8xq-q7px-wg8c", "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/pull/817", "https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/commit/80fea89117358ee105973453fdc402398ae20239", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24770", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gradio/PYSEC-2022-229.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-24770.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24770", "GHSA-f8xq-q7px-wg8c", "PYSEC-2022-229"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f187b1df-521b-3ce9-9f15-e1a9714f2c89", "product": {"name": "gradio"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6f8c3852-045a-3089-b0cb-8407d7c091a4", "vendor": {"name": "gradio-app"}}], "isExploited": false}
