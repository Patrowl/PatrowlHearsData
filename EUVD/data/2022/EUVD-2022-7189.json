Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has obtained local access through some means) would be able to discover the password by listing processes and their arguments.

Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that.\" Nonetheless, the issue was fixed in 2.2.220.", "datePublished": "2022-11-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T20:58:46", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:L/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:U/UI:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-45868", "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3686", "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/pull/3833", "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/commit/581ed18ff9d6b3761d851620ed88a3994a351a0d", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj", "https://github.com/h2database/h2database", "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/96832bf5a97cdc0adc1f2066ed61c54990d66ab5/h2/src/main/org/h2/server/web/WebServer.java#L346-L347", "https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-2.2.220", "https://sites.google.com/sonatype.com/vulnerabilities/sonatype-2022-6243"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-45868", "GHSA-22wj-vf5f-wrvj"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "49b6d75a-edb2-3d01-82b2-cd70d936348a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cba25362-f776-3a30-8891-19b2ecb1dfce", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
