If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063.", "datePublished": "2022-11-03T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T16:08:20", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-25mx-2mxm-6343", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39382", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8031", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8063", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/pull/8031/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39382", "GHSA-25mx-2mxm-6343"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e5b736f5-081e-39f0-8f13-9cb550dfea80", "product": {"name": "Keystone"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "db3f187c-23c9-3483-9f41-1a60f9afea35", "vendor": {"name": "keystonejs"}}], "isExploited": false}
