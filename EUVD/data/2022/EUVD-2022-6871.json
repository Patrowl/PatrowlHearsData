If `RaggedTensorToVariant` is given a `rt_nested_splits` list that contains tensors of ranks other than one, it results in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 88f93dfe691563baa4ae1e80ccde2d5c7a143821. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-09-16T22:05:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:01:17", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-m6cv-4fmf-66xf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36018", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/88f93dfe691563baa4ae1e80ccde2d5c7a143821", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow", "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.10.0", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-36018.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36018", "GHSA-m6cv-4fmf-66xf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13d0cadb-8404-30b3-8fbc-134ebdc42620", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.8.0, < 2.8.1"}, {"id": "3ea6fd8d-b407-3a64-8ea3-fa01e34cb41a", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "2.9.0, < 2.9.1"}, {"id": "586eefeb-9de1-3b1d-acdf-8bed5b2b52cf", "product": {"name": "tensorflow"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7677186-033c-301f-a660-6e5e9dac0f89", "vendor": {"name": "tensorflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
