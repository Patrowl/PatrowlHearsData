Specifically, the attacker must send X-Forwarded-Host to the /index.php?p=admin/actions/users/send-password-reset-email URI. NOTE: the vendor's position is that a customer can already work around this by adjusting the configuration (i.e., by not using the default configuration).", "datePublished": "2022-05-09T17:48:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:33:43", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29933", "https://github.com/craftcms/cms", "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab", "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/password-reset-poisoning-attack-craft-cms", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166989/Craft-CMS-3.7.36-Password-Reset-Poisoning-Attack.html", "https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2022-29933", "https://github.com/craftcms/cms/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md", "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/password-reset-poisoning-attack-craft-cms/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29933", "GHSA-5cjr-78cq-3wrg"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2de7b7c4-f0f7-3450-bd79-94ab289b4310", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "432b7b1d-335b-3dca-a6ff-ed4dc94b0b0b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
