Versions of nextcloudcmd prior to 3.6.1 would incorrectly trust invalid TLS certificates, which may enable a Man-in-the-middle attack that exposes sensitive data or credentials to a network attacker. This affects the CLI only. It does not affect the standard GUI desktop Nextcloud clients, and it does not affect the Nextcloud server.", "datePublished": "2022-11-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T18:08:05", "baseScore": 3.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-39334.html", "https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-82xx-98xv-4jxv", "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/4927", "https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/5022", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1699740"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39334"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "da1ee3e7-a61b-36b6-a72a-b96632a9f5d7", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "< 3.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67d00afd-4f54-31af-8571-46eb2ab2bb84", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
