A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the build. At this point the build directory will have the full access that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build --nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after finalization, which can lead to issues even with the `--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the `appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile. This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the behaviour of `--nofilesystem=home` and `--nofilesystem=host`.", "datePublished": "2022-01-13T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T02:46:39", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-21682.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5049", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-21682.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7458", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-8ch7-5j3h-g4fx", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/445bddeee657fdc8d2a0a1f0de12975400d4fc1a", "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/4d11f77aa7fd3e64cfa80af89d92567ab9e8e6fa", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/APFTBYGJJVJPFVHRXUW5PII5XOAFI4KH/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IXKBERLJRYV7KXKGXOLI6IOXVBQNN4DP/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-12"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21682"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "93dd207d-a1d2-354f-bf9e-e6e78b79e756", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "1.11.0, < 1.12.3"}, {"id": "a7c918a5-adcb-326d-a216-a913da2c7595", "product": {"name": "flatpak"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "732203b4-93ff-3c49-8c3c-f0f79870a887", "vendor": {"name": "flatpak"}}], "isExploited": false}
