Flarum's page title system allowed for page titles to be converted into HTML DOM nodes when pages were rendered. The change was made after `v1.5` and was not noticed. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML markup using a discussion title input, either by creating a new discussion or renaming one. The XSS attack occurs after a visitor opens the relevant discussion page. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core `v1.6.2`. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to `v1.6.1` have to upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.2. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-11-19T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:36:43", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-7x4w-j98p-854x", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41938", "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/690de9ce0ffe7ac4d45b73e303f44340c3433138", "https://discuss.flarum.org/d/27558", "https://github.com/flarum/framework"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41938", "GHSA-7x4w-j98p-854x"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f5f85f66-bf54-34d9-9fe6-68a73deeea56", "product": {"name": "framework"}, "product_version": "1.5.0, < 1.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "71b22964-390c-31f0-be84-62e21b061a5e", "vendor": {"name": "flarum"}}], "isExploited": false}
