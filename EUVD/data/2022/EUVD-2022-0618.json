The maintainers found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient tfor protection from a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack. If an attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources. v4.5.1 passes the test against ASCII characters but misses the case of multibyte characters. jsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.", "datePublished": "2021-12-20T21:15:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:10:16", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q", "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-hp68-xhvj-x6j6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43843", "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/commit/46bc88391d89d5fda4ce689e18ca080bcdd29ecc", "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/releases/tag/v4.5.2", "https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43843", "GHSA-hp68-xhvj-x6j6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1b34dced-b6f1-3621-bbce-03535c574112", "product": {"name": "jsx-slack"}, "product_version": "< 4.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "42ab9a3f-a9df-3734-9f5f-d362c9c77b9a", "vendor": {"name": "yhatt"}}], "isExploited": false}
