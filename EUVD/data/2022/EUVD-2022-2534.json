{"id": "EUVD-2022-2534", "enisaUuid": "54eb94cc-3100-37b0-9a76-32d5b1bb55a3", "description": "SilverStripe 4.5.0 allows attackers to read certain records that should not have been placed into a result set. This affects silverstripe/recipe-cms. The automatic permission-checking mechanism in the silverstripe/graphql module does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination), resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by default (e.g., for assets), but the admin/graphql endpoint is access protected by default. This limits the vulnerability to all authenticated users, including those with limited permissions (e.g., where viewing records exposed through admin/graphql requires administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have been configured for a specific implementation (usually under /graphql), this vulnerability could also be exploited through unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies to reading records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records.", "datePublished": "2020-07-15T20:27:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T08:55:21", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6165", "https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/changelogs/4.5.3/?_ga=2.170693920.105499209.1689776417-708940272.1689776417", "https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/changelogs/4.6.0/?_ga=2.170693920.105499209.1689776417-708940272.1689776417", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/silverstripe/graphql/CVE-2020-6165.yaml", "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6165"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-6165", "GHSA-589q-75r3-mfq4"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "75886575-9ad6-33e1-9a68-ab1e05caa1a6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "43c43b37-743b-320e-a369-054004629101", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
