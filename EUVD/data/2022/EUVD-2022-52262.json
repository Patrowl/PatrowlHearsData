According to FSCT-2022-0050, there is a Trend Controls Inter-Controller (IC) protocol cleartext transmission of credentials issue. The affected components are characterized as: Inter-Controller (IC) protocol (57612/UDP). The potential impact is: Compromise of credentials. Several Trend Controls building automation controllers utilize the Inter-Controller (IC) protocol in for information exchange and automation purposes. This protocol offers authentication in the form of a 4-digit PIN in order to protect access to sensitive operations like strategy uploads and downloads as well as optional 0-30 character username and password protection for web page access protection. Both the PIN and usernames and passwords are transmitted in cleartext, allowing an attacker with passive interception capabilities to obtain these credentials. Credentials are transmitted in cleartext. An attacker who obtains Trend IC credentials can carry out sensitive engineering actions such as manipulating controller strategy or configuration settings. If the credentials in question are (re)used for other applications, their compromise could potentially facilitate lateral movement.", "datePublished": "2022-09-07T17:54:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-17T19:36:00", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.forescout.com/blog/", "https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-242-08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-30312"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "efd0d544-8a6b-312a-88b9-4f4c70c51061", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b03ec702-f173-34b3-892d-ff97129fb78b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
