An IT administrator could mistakenly deploy administrator privileged PingID API credentials, such as those typically used by PingFederate, into PingID Windows Login user endpoints. Using sensitive full permissions properties file outside of a privileged trust boundary leads to an increased risk of exposure or discovery, and an attacker could leverage these credentials to perform administrative actions against PingID APIs or endpoints.", "datePublished": "2022-06-30T19:25:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T03:51:45", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/downloads/pingid.html", "https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/pingid/page/zhy1653552428545.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23720"], "assigner": "Ping Identity", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4bb6845d-2178-3c82-a04c-95bd116d932c", "product": {"name": "PingID Windows Login"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "73fe423d-917a-3ada-b146-b850e729a927", "vendor": {"name": "Ping Identity"}}], "isExploited": false}
