The panic is of the\nform below and is observed only with following option disabled(profile) for the\nsaid LPAR 'Enable Performance Information Collection' in the HMC:\n\n Kernel attempted to write user page (1c) - exploit attempt?

However drc_pmem_query_stats() shouldn't have been called\nsince the vPMEM NVDIMM doesn't support and performance stat-id's. This was caused\ndue to missing check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of\npapr_scm_pmu_check_events() which indicates that the NVDIMM doesn't support\nperformance-stats.\n\nFix this by introducing the check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of\npapr_scm_pmu_check_events().\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/6B3A522A-6A5F-4CC9-B268-0C63AA6E07D3@linux.ibm.com", "datePublished": "2025-02-26T02:11:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-01T19:46:54", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1295aab2ebcda1c1a9ed342baedc080e5c393e5", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07bf9431b1590d1cd7a8d62075d0b50b073f0495"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-49353"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19337689-c9f8-35b6-b419-55ad1a50b0c3", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "0e0946e22f3665d27325d389ff45ade6e93f3678 <07bf9431b1590d1cd7a8d62075d0b50b073f0495"}, {"id": "5d5f36d6-e841-30ef-8597-5821b7113366", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "b073096df4dec70d0436321b7093bad27ae91f9e <e1295aab2ebcda1c1a9ed342baedc080e5c393e5"}, {"id": "fb7516a1-53ff-3913-a318-d7ac7f485572", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.18.3 <5.18.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9fc3fdf2-a2de-3494-83d9-448a156829cc", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
