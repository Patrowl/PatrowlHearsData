This vulnerability exists because SSL server certificates are not validated when Cisco Nexus Dashboard is establishing a connection to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud APIC, or Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller, formerly Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) controllers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and the controllers, and then using a crafted certificate to impersonate the controllers. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter communications between devices or view sensitive information, including Administrator credentials for these controllers.", "datePublished": "2022-07-21T03:45:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:59:51", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nd-tlsvld-TbAQLp3N"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20860"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84455270-c12c-3bd7-a2a7-1ac0ffb0f24c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Nexus Dashboard"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa2c4448-4b2a-3c6e-ba48-348e199c4632", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
