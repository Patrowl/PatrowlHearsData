A denial-of-service vulnerability affects applications on a 32-bit systems that use PJSIP versions 2.12 and prior to play/read invalid WAV files. The vulnerability occurs when reading WAV file data chunks with length greater than 31-bit integers. The vulnerability does not affect 64-bit apps and should not affect apps that only plays trusted WAV files. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the `pjsip/project` GitHub repository. As a workaround, apps can reject a WAV file received from an unknown source or validate the file first.", "datePublished": "2022-04-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:32:37", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-rwgw-vwxg-q799", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/947bc1ee6d05be10204b918df75a503415fd3213", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00047.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24792"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d17c0e3a-7dc3-3d84-bb7d-b493d96fe953", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa519c43-4885-35b4-a5be-ee4a756ba1a4", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
