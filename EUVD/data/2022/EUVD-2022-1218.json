In 2.23.0, Prometheus changed its default UI to the New ui. To ensure a seamless transition, the URL's prefixed by /new redirect to /. Due to a bug in the code, it is possible for an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect to any other URL, in the /new endpoint. If a user visits a prometheus server with a specially crafted address, they can be redirected to an arbitrary URL. The issue was patched in the 2.26.1 and 2.27.1 releases. In 2.28.0, the /new endpoint will be removed completely. The workaround is to disable access to /new via a reverse proxy in front of Prometheus.", "datePublished": "2021-05-19T20:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T22:11:06", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/security/advisories/GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29622", "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.26.1", "https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/tag/v2.27.1", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-29622.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2438", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-29622"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-29622", "GHSA-vx57-7f4q-fpc7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 86.63, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6c7729e0-2efb-3cd2-9cd1-92bdb0f4cad8", "product": {"name": "prometheus"}, "product_version": "2.23.0, < 2.27.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c45d4b90-1d68-3997-a546-24b834d5ed7d", "vendor": {"name": "prometheus"}}], "isExploited": false}
