These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-05-27T14:05:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:14:04", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-multi-xss-tyDFjhwb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20671"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a06e7ee0-47f0-3a38-8493-4dcbc7b689c5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "450f0b10-9cac-37e5-a213-755aed870684", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
