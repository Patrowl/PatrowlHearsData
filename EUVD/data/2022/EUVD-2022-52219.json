When certificates are used to authenticate clients in TLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client is not enforced to be contained in the client's certificate. So clients can authenticate with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic if the identity is used to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version 5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136).", "datePublished": "2024-05-13T12:09:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:38:39", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/strongswan/strongswan/commit/e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136", "https://www.strongswan.org/blog/2024/05/13/strongswan-vulnerability-(cve-2022-4967).html", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4967", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240614-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-4967"], "assigner": "canonical", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5902a201-2e95-3bf3-90a1-29974bb21d97", "product": {"name": "strongSwan"}, "product_version": "5.9.2 <5.9.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "27537439-64f8-31c7-8504-9db26f94d8ac", "vendor": {"name": "strongSwan"}}], "isExploited": false}
