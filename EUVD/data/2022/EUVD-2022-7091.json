Prior to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build.", "datePublished": "2022-10-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:44:28", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/security/advisories/GHSA-f9qj-7gh3-mhj4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39326", "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/pull/19", "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows", "https://github.com/kartverket/github-workflows/releases/tag/v2.7.5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39326", "GHSA-f9qj-7gh3-mhj4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "94044575-df2d-3621-9fcc-2eebdac32bd4", "product": {"name": "github-workflows"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dc47f804-bf3c-3cd4-8648-85a22057b6a7", "vendor": {"name": "kartverket"}}], "isExploited": false}
