This vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap related to a wireless client connection event. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an 802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of a connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:16:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:26:13", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-snmp-trap-dos-mjent3Ey"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20684"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e1c4f447-6231-3baa-a2d1-9196da55ba08", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "979446fd-667b-3469-b27d-e4e6f282abb8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
