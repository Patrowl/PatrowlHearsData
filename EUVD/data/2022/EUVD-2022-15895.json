The specific impact varies upon the privileges of the Red Hat account in question, but it could affect the integrity, availability, and/or data confidentiality of other systems that are administered by that account. This occurs regardless of how the password is supplied to convert2rhel.", "datePublished": "2022-08-29T14:03:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T23:40:04", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1599", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1617", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1618", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2060129", "https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHELC-432", "https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/pull/492", "https://github.com/oamg/convert2rhel/commit/8d72fb030ed31116fdb256b327d299337b000af4", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0852"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-0852"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "015a5589-af81-3581-b639-35618d2c2027", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
