An attacker with write access to the targeted bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and re-encrypt your files.", "datePublished": "2020-08-11T19:20:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T10:12:10", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-8912", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/pull/3403", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/commit/1e84382fa1c0086362b5a4b68e068d4f8518d40e", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/commit/ae9b9fd92af132cfd8d879809d8611825ba135f4", "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/updates-to-the-amazon-s3-encryption-client/?s=09", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1869801", "https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go", "https://github.com/sophieschmieg/exploits/tree/master/aws_s3_crypto_poc", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-0646", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3851"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-8912", "GHSA-7f33-f4f5-xwgw"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ab4c8683-1238-3566-816d-f667a07a9dbb", "product": {"name": "AWS S3 Crypto SDK for GoLang"}, "product_version": "stable \u2264V1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d68d50b7-1be0-3c5e-8884-704288cd12f5", "vendor": {"name": "Google LLC"}}], "isExploited": false}
