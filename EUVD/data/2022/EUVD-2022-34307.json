This is due to missing nonce protection on the dxss_admin_page() function found in the ~/dx-share-selection.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2022-07-18T16:17:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:24:43", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a85fe7f-2d28-4509-99f2-875cb63c6500?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/dx-share-selection/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/dx-share-selection/trunk/dx-share-selection.php#L284", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2001", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2747572/dx-share-selection/trunk?contextall=1&old=2384535&old_path=%2Fdx-share-selection%2Ftrunk"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2001"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c077a73a-9231-3925-9160-62a49d596b01", "product": {"name": "DX Share Selection"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fcbca278-cbfd-3ded-a992-3c7c157763d5", "vendor": {"name": "nofearinc"}}], "isExploited": false}
