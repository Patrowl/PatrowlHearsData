In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-01-05T19:20:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:14:34", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-p523-jrph-qjc6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21652", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/47ebd126a94f4b019b6fde64c0df3d18d74ef7d0", "https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/securityupdates/security-update-01-2022", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21652", "GHSA-p523-jrph-qjc6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22b91792-524c-3f80-9538-62083938195a", "product": {"name": "shopware"}, "product_version": "5.7.3, < 5.7.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "412c9813-951d-3a90-9470-a16cc2d1e4cc", "vendor": {"name": "shopware"}}], "isExploited": false}
