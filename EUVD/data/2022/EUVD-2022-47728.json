The authorization service has a flow that allows getting access to the Web UI without knowing credentials. For signing, the JWT token uses a secret key that is generated through a function that doesn't produce cryptographically strong sequences. An attacker can predict these sequences and generate a JWT token. As a result, an attacker can get access to the Web UI. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.", "datePublished": "2022-11-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T14:01:31", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://objectfirst.com/security/of-20221024-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-44796"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "63729cdc-8bda-3880-b1e9-a0f81eaad06c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e22659f4-e552-3bc0-9c18-1fd9264e189f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
