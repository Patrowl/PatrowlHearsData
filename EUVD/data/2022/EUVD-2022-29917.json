This weakness allows the attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2 22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).", "datePublished": "2022-03-07T21:50:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T04:36:06", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-01"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-25218"], "assigner": "tenable", "epss": 1.16, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c8d13ec6-6251-3abb-a671-f02c444911f2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
