Any user making use of a wildcard relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return a resource as \"accessible\" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the exclusion. Version 1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of intersections or within exclusions.", "datePublished": "2022-01-11T21:50:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T19:13:28", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21646", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/issues/358", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/commit/15bba2e2d2a4bda336a37a7fe8ef8a35028cd970", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.4.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21646", "GHSA-7p8f-8hjm-wm92"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6eb7aa9b-b824-3f8c-a296-e9408bdde613", "product": {"name": "spicedb"}, "product_version": "= 1.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "78abc90e-b362-313f-ab7b-214cfc54e37f", "vendor": {"name": "authzed"}}], "isExploited": false}
