If there are sufficient clients already waiting when a new client query is received so that it is necessary to SERVFAIL the longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-clients` limit and soft quota), then it is possible for a race to occur between providing a stale answer to this older client and sending an early timeout SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.12 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0 through 9.19.8, and 9.16.12-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.", "datePublished": "2023-01-25T21:39:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T01:20:58", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5329", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-3924.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3924", "https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2022-3924"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-3924"], "assigner": "isc", "epss": 0.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b2aa5c4-32b1-3c11-90af-e26b08f7c677", "product": {"name": "BIND 9"}, "product_version": "9.18.0 \u22649.18.10"}, {"id": "7930ab9c-0fe0-31fc-857d-f7e687acf66c", "product": {"name": "BIND 9"}, "product_version": "9.19.0 \u22649.19.8"}, {"id": "d19db2ec-0e23-3e46-bcce-e9e74bd7afe2", "product": {"name": "BIND 9"}, "product_version": "9.16.12 \u22649.16.36"}, {"id": "e5340d70-aae0-3ccf-a26b-de37cd4083d1", "product": {"name": "BIND 9"}, "product_version": "9.16.12-S1 \u22649.16.36-S1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e90c962-69e2-3bbc-8346-12f2234612c8", "vendor": {"name": "ISC"}}], "isExploited": false}
