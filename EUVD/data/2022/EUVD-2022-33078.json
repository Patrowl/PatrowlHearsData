An unprivileged user could locally exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code in an isolated process resulting in a complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability within that process. In addition, an unprivileged user could exploit a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in an isolated process resulting in a complete loss of availability within that process. A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attackers control. HPE has provided a firmware update to resolve this vulnerability in HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5).", "datePublished": "2022-08-11T17:17:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T05:56:16", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbhf04333en_us"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-28636"], "assigner": "hpe", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "213e170b-e891-309e-b264-69e05d28da25", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
