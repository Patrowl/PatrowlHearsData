This flaw is strictly related to CVE-2018-13405. A local guest user can create files in the directories shared by virtio-fs with unintended group ownership in a scenario where a directory is SGID to a certain group and is writable by a user who is not a member of the group. This could allow a malicious unprivileged user inside the guest to gain access to resources accessible to the root group, potentially escalating their privileges within the guest. A malicious local user in the host might also leverage this unexpected executable file created by the guest to escalate their privileges on the host system.", "datePublished": "2022-08-29T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T23:25:40", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0358.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0759", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-0358", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0886", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0949", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0971", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:0973", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5133", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2022-0358.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2044863", "https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/449e8171f96a6a944d1f3b7d3627ae059eae21ca", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-0358", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221007-0008/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-0358"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c6e8015-7f44-3d42-a011-85be514170f1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
