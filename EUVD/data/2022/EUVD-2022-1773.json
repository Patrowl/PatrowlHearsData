The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at `yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0 when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data), which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk. These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`, which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on 32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround, avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.", "datePublished": "2022-04-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:17:37", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-jj47-x69x-mxrm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24795", "https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/commit/7168bd79b888900aa94523301126f968a93eb3a6", "https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby", "https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/blob/7168bd79b888900aa94523301126f968a93eb3a6/ext/yajl/yajl_buf.c#L64", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/yajl-ruby/CVE-2022-24795.yml", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00013.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00003.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KLE3C4CECEJ4EUYI56KXI6OWACWXX7WN", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YO32YDJ74DADC7CMJNLSLBVWN5EXGF5J", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-24795.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7524", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8252", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KLE3C4CECEJ4EUYI56KXI6OWACWXX7WN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YO32YDJ74DADC7CMJNLSLBVWN5EXGF5J/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24795", "GHSA-jj47-x69x-mxrm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aacfdd67-db4f-3bb7-8b1a-c844f848212b", "product": {"name": "yajl-ruby"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d1b7e42b-f735-39d5-9258-0e48c4449ed4", "vendor": {"name": "brianmario"}}], "isExploited": false}
