A user with this privilege would be able to create new alerting rules or overwrite existing ones. However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules.", "datePublished": "2022-03-03T21:50:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T03:51:46", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23709.html", "https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-7-17-1-security-update/298447"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23709"], "assigner": "elastic", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c41db149-6e4b-3886-a77d-61afc0d15ada", "product": {"name": "Kibana"}, "product_version": "Versions 7.7.0 through 7.17.0, and 8.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af3f731b-ccbc-3852-be64-e1d597b72594", "vendor": {"name": "Elastic"}}], "isExploited": false}
