Prior to version 4.6.0, performing an API request using a valid API key with insufficient permissions causes the API key to be written to Dependency-Track's audit log in clear text. Actors with access to the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain access to valid API keys. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging the entire API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be logged. It is strongly recommended to check historic logs for occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys in case of leakage.", "datePublished": "2022-10-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:43:44", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.dependencytrack.org/changelog/", "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-gh7v-4hxp-gqp4", "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/blob/4.5.0/src/main/docker/logback.xml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39351"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "419fbb6d-9e54-3220-9604-261340df2e6b", "product": {"name": "Dependency-Track"}, "product_version": "< 4.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2b8e079e-1c6c-364d-b03b-1f74a22f41e5", "vendor": {"name": "DependencyTrack"}}], "isExploited": false}
