In affected versions certain types of invalid files requests are not handled properly and can crash the server. If you are running multiple Parse Server instances in a cluster, the availability impact may be low; if you are running Parse Server as single instance without redundancy, the availability impact may be high. This issue has been addressed in versions 4.10.12 and 5.2.3. Users are advised to upgrade.
