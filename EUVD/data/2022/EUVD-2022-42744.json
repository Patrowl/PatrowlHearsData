This makes it possible for attackers with administrative privileges to supply arbitrary paths using traversal (../../) to access and include files outside of the intended directory. If an attacker can successfully upload a php file then remote code execution via inclusion may also be possible. Note: for users with less than administrative capabilities, /wp-admin access needs to be enabled for that user in order for this to be exploitable by those users.", "datePublished": "2022-11-29T20:39:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-31T18:24:13", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/A:N/I:N/C:L/S:U/UI:N/PR:L/AC:L/AV:N", "references": ["https://www.yuque.com/docs/share/23f988ad-1402-42f2-b8d2-c7a87a4022bd", "https://github.com/H4de5-7/vulnerabilities/blob/main/CVE-2022-3361.md", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3361", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2805393%40ultimate-member&new=2805393%40ultimate-member&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-3361"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 5.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d9194632-d19d-36e6-943d-3aff4259d382", "product": {"name": "Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, User Registration, Login & Membership Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c6512f75-61bb-38cf-9655-bfb365184d11", "vendor": {"name": "ultimatemember"}}], "isExploited": false}
