This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-07-21T04:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:56:22", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iotcc-xss-WQrCLRVd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20916"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aa19c096-aa8f-3931-b989-2590353d441e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IoT Control Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "baa4d228-6e90-3a66-8f02-3323470e1346", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
