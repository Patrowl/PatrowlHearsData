A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a web application firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted resource may bypass pattern matching techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia level of 3 or higher.", "datePublished": "2022-09-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T19:27:33", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-39958.html", "https://coreruleset.org/20220919/crs-version-3-3-3-and-3-2-2-covering-several-cves/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PD56EAYNGB6E6QQH62LAYCONOP6OH5DZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YPQ6CCMX3MU4A7MTCGQJA7VMJW3IQDXV/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HL2L2GF7GOCWPMJZDUE5OXDSXHGG3XUJ/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00033.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-25", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39958", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/08/msg00004.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HL2L2GF7GOCWPMJZDUE5OXDSXHGG3XUJ", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PD56EAYNGB6E6QQH62LAYCONOP6OH5DZ", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YPQ6CCMX3MU4A7MTCGQJA7VMJW3IQDXV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39958"], "assigner": "NCSC.ch", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "36fbc7f6-d924-3f9e-abe3-e304e0951006", "product": {"name": "ModSecurity Core Rule Set"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u22643.2.1"}, {"id": "bfbf0120-2390-3e9b-83e2-197d99b98192", "product": {"name": "ModSecurity Core Rule Set"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u22643.3.2"}, {"id": "df2e08f8-63e4-3f26-8199-df7a0e3cada7", "product": {"name": "ModSecurity Core Rule Set"}, "product_version": "3.1.x"}, {"id": "ed9824b3-1fac-3b5e-a403-5b448dc131d9", "product": {"name": "ModSecurity Core Rule Set"}, "product_version": "3.0.x"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4cde89d7-a62b-3508-8ac3-e5df87d6dd8d", "vendor": {"name": "OWASP"}}], "isExploited": false}
