This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:20:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:25:00", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cgr1k-ap-dos-mSZR4QVh"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20761"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4dd3d3f6-ba3e-398d-8a43-ab20899c356e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a1f0adc5-80f7-39e3-bea4-68317241e146", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
