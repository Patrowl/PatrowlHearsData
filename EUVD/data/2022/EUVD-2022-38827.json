With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T21:05:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:14:18", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/security/advisories/GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r", "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/pull/487", "https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36065"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4f9d136f-0685-30a2-9443-aa4bdd7c3631", "product": {"name": "growthbook"}, "product_version": "< 2022-08-29"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96bc4a7a-97b1-3451-9750-846210ac3597", "vendor": {"name": "growthbook"}}], "isExploited": false}
