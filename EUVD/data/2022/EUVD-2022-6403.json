Prior to versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the router switch in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`.", "datePublished": "2022-07-11T20:25:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:03:32", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/security/advisories/GHSA-qpx3-9565-5xwm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31078", "https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31078", "GHSA-qpx3-9565-5xwm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "836253f4-edea-3e3c-bd9f-8ad68ed77df6", "product": {"name": "kubeedge"}, "product_version": "= 1.11.0"}, {"id": "95c3e5cc-1eab-3c50-8ae5-98a56cff5e09", "product": {"name": "kubeedge"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.4"}, {"id": "bcf98ea7-aded-325c-befd-f8495c074c65", "product": {"name": "kubeedge"}, "product_version": "1.10.0, < 1.10.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "35e1ea1f-bae1-3886-847f-0c4a2c62337d", "vendor": {"name": "kubeedge"}}], "isExploited": false}
