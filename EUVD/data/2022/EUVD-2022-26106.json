This vulnerability is due to a logic error and improper management of resources related to the handling of CAPWAP Mobility messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CAPWAP Mobility packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device. This would cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-09-30T18:46:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T18:50:19", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-mob-dos-342YAc6J"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20856"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81e1b2f1-b49e-3591-8072-6961b6eced60", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "54ac5a6d-fef2-3430-bb4b-e5b64c81da7f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
