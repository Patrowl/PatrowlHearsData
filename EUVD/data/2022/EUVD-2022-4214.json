This functionality improperly checked permissions, allowing any user with Item/Build permission (but not Item/Configure) to connect to any web server or Subversion server and send credentials with a known ID, thereby possibly capturing them. Additionally, this functionality did not require POST requests be used, thereby allowing the above to be performed without direct access to Jenkins via Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.", "datePublished": "2017-10-04T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T21:53:06", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000085", "https://github.com/jenkinsci/subversion-plugin", "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-07-10", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171119065136/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/99574", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017:2642", "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-07-10/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000085", "GHSA-hrwc-pqfm-g6qf"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e20174b6-1f77-38af-890f-87047d266b5f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "970c3ecf-f61c-3bed-94ee-0c44d6c46cf0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
