It also created a backup directory with all old secrets, and the key used to encrypt them. These backups were world-readable and not removed afterwards. Jenkins now deletes the backup directory, if present. Upgrading from before 1.498 will no longer create a backup directory. Administrators relying on file access permissions in their manually created backups are advised to check them for the directory $JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.security.RekeySecretAdminMonitor/backups, and delete it if present.", "datePublished": "2017-07-13T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T22:00:40", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000362", "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/0be33cf7328fad6a7596ce9505a74561a8b1eb85", "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/a572450f039fdb99410fcf6eb0ba307bd69ea458", "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins", "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01", "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000362", "GHSA-92mr-4w2q-4578"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e7bd6018-ba60-3eb6-a8ef-c13d3500df52", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "62bd503e-f384-3686-9ea7-72ab268435e8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
