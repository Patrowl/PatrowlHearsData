There is Path Traversal via the \"restore SQL data\" filename. The Vocera Report Console contains a websocket function that allows for the restoration of the database from a ZIP archive that expects a SQL import file. The filename provided is not properly sanitized and allows for the inclusion of a path-traversal payload that can be used to escape the intended Vocera restoration directory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to point to a crafted ZIP archive that contains SQL commands that could be executed against the database.", "datePublished": "2023-07-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-23T20:33:43", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/governance/cyber-security/product-security/", "https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/governance/cyber-security/product-security/vocera-report-server-vulnerabilities--cve-2022-46898--cve-2022-4.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-46898"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c3e17610-93db-3561-ab2e-02046e753c7d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17e636bf-e00c-3fc1-b7ba-f8cbb72297bf", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
