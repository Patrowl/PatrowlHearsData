An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by inserting crafted input into various data fields in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface, or access sensitive, browser-based information. In some cases, it is also possible to cause a temporary availability impact to portions of the FMC Dashboard.", "datePublished": "2022-11-10T17:41:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T02:24:49", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-LATZYzxs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20840"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "855d9970-31e2-3b40-945f-c060979bb9d7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.1"}, {"id": "8bef453d-6c49-3bbd-b7af-b3467cd1f8d3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.2.0"}, {"id": "b2129df6-b469-3b7d-91c0-4e214bff5862", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0"}, {"id": "f5acfeab-79dc-3a49-b6f2-bced2a016487", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.2.0.1"}, {"id": "faf6c4db-0d64-36fb-b305-3ddc08c9a89b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "7.1.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b30f3e6d-f582-3fe5-ae09-912fd6a18eee", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
