Windows installations via either the server or agent installers for GoCD prior to 22.2.0 do not adequately restrict permissions when installing outside of the default location. This could allow a malicious user with local access to the server GoCD Server or Agent are installed on to modify executables or components of the installation. This does not affect zip file-based installs, installations to other platforms, or installations inside `Program Files` or `Program Files (x86)`. This issue is fixed in GoCD 22.2.0 installers. As a workaround, if the server or agent is installed outside of `Program Files (x86)`, verify the the permission of the Server or Agent installation directory to ensure the `Everyone` user group does not have `Full Control`, `Modify` or `Write` permissions.", "datePublished": "2022-09-07T22:55:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:13:25", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gocd/gocd/security/advisories/GHSA-gpv4-xqhc-5vcj", "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/commit/96add9605096ab50c5cd4c229be1d503aff506a6", "https://github.com/gocd/gocd/releases/tag/22.2.0", "https://www.gocd.org/releases/#22-2-0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36088"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02dd087a-267b-3e8e-8b13-bc3b2e905bbb", "product": {"name": "gocd"}, "product_version": "< 22.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "32a9007c-a9b1-3401-949d-5f58da05d9bc", "vendor": {"name": "gocd"}}], "isExploited": false}
