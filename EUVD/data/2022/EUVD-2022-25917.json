These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-05-27T14:05:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:14:46", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-multi-xss-tyDFjhwb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20667"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3a966dff-1cc5-315f-b3d2-bcef1c8bd65c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5b3e8fd-d90b-3629-914a-a7c36c075458", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
