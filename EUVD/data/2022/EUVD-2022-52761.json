Affected versions of HumHub are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, the attacker would need a permission to administer the Spaces feature. The names of individual \"spaces\" are not properly escaped and so an attacker with sufficient privilege could insert malicious javascript into a space name and exploit system users who visit that space. It is recommended that the HumHub is upgraded to 1.11.4, 1.10.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-07-07T17:45:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:04:24", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/humhub/humhub/security/advisories/GHSA-p7h3-73v7-959c", "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/07d9f8f9b6334970ee38156a3416c3708d157cae", "https://github.com/humhub/humhub/commit/f88991dfe56a05870df165ac89a2755dd4c1ffa1", "https://huntr.dev/bounties/89d996a2-de30-4261-8e3f-98e54cb25f76"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31133"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3998e3f9-d76a-3395-82eb-dd4134047a24", "product": {"name": "HumHub"}, "product_version": "< 1.11.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c35e8003-9e34-3b86-bda3-018b4a890f39", "vendor": {"name": "humhub"}}], "isExploited": false}
