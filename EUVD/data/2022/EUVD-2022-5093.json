The `login` command available in the remoting-based CLI stored the encrypted user name of the successfully authenticated user in a cache file used to authenticate further commands. Users with sufficient permission to create secrets in Jenkins, and download their encrypted values (e.g. with Job/Configure permission), were able to impersonate any other Jenkins user on the same instance.", "datePublished": "2018-01-29T17:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T22:00:39", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-1000354", "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/02d24053bdfeb219d2387a19885a60bdab510479", "https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins", "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-26", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200227174424/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98065", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2017-1000354", "https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-04-26/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-1000354", "GHSA-r57f-7xw3-q2r9"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c90d9a8c-9e7a-3309-8139-dc51ad4f7f7c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d67cabf-d2ee-3518-8dd3-0e4edf5c9455", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
