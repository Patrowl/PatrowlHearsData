{"id": "EUVD-2022-6246", "enisaUuid": "cf9cc1ff-f2c9-3207-9bc8-f1df3ddf3c93", "description": "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, the `tagName` property of an `Ember.View` was inserted into such a string without being sanitized. This means that if an application assigns a view's `tagName` to user-supplied data, a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\"). This vulnerability only affects applications that assign or bind user-provided content to `tagName`.", "datePublished": "2022-06-30T12:38:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T16:38:01", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-4170", "https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/ember-source/CVE-2013-4170.yml", "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ember-security/dokLVwwxAdM", "https://groups.google.com/g/ember-security/c/dokLVwwxAdM", "https://rubysec.com/advisories/CVE-2013-4170", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-EMBERSOURCE-20102", "https://rubysec.com/advisories/CVE-2013-4170/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2013-4170", "GHSA-5m48-c37x-f792"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cd083beb-15f3-3554-9cff-f3ddec17b625", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
