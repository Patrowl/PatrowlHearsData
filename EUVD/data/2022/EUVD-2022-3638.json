Prior to version 0.36.0, there is a possible consensus split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s, there is an issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64` values are included on chain. In those cases, Lodestar may view valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid, due to rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network. Similarly, Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid, thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in `AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so one may carefully use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.", "datePublished": "2022-05-24T14:15:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:22:36", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/security/advisories/GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29219", "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/pull/3977", "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar", "https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/releases/tag/v0.36.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29219", "GHSA-cvj7-5f3c-9vg9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a6905e0-7bd1-3817-a96b-5391d6e5126d", "product": {"name": "lodestar"}, "product_version": "< 0.36.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "35c2b1e8-536b-39ef-a3e7-7feb85a2a090", "vendor": {"name": "ChainSafe"}}], "isExploited": false}
