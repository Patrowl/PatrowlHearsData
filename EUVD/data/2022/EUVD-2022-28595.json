An attacker could maliciously craft a full name for their account and send messages to a topic with several participants; a victim who then opens an overflow tooltip including this full name on the recent topics page could trigger execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker. Users running a Zulip server from the main branch should upgrade from main (2022-03-01 or later) again to deploy this fix.", "datePublished": "2022-03-02T20:25:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:59:20", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-fc77-h3jc-6mfv", "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e090027adcbf62737d5b1f83a9618a9500a49321"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23656"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7fd525b7-97c0-3ef4-b1ec-a3f64b382b3f", "product": {"name": "zulip"}, "product_version": "2021-06-03, < 2022-03-01"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11034b85-7d66-36b1-a0f5-93680be4b393", "vendor": {"name": "zulip"}}], "isExploited": false}
