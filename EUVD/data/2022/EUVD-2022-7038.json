Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used. List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field.", "datePublished": "2022-10-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:17:35", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39322", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/commit/65c6ee3deef23605fc72b80230908696a7a65e7c", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39322", "GHSA-6mhr-52mv-6v6f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6562147c-4720-375f-9e6b-8a7902a81d1d", "product": {"name": "Keystone"}, "product_version": "2.2.0, < 2.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8b0ac062-53b8-3764-ad70-2739879855f0", "vendor": {"name": "keystonejs"}}], "isExploited": false}
