In some situations, it is possible to have open redirects where users can be redirected from your site to any other site using a specially crafted URL.

Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix this bug. Stripping the URL from special characters to prevent specially crafted URL's from being redirected to. As a work around users can set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`, however this may degrade connection security.", "datePublished": "2021-05-27T16:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T23:25:30", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/security/advisories/GHSA-4r8q-gv9j-3xx6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32645", "https://github.com/tenancy/multi-tenant/commit/9c837a21bccce9bcaeb90033ef200d84f0d9e164", "https://packagist.org/packages/hyn/multi-tenant", "https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/01/open-redirect-urls-is-your-site-being.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32645", "GHSA-4r8q-gv9j-3xx6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6fcc38e9-4e73-331f-9052-882ba555ccfe", "product": {"name": "multi-tenant"}, "product_version": "5.6.0, < 5.7.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "857b084f-f87a-36b3-bd6c-b3298f090da3", "vendor": {"name": "tenancy"}}], "isExploited": false}
