A successful attack requires a SAML identity provider to be configured. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must know the unique SAML callback ID of the configured identity source. A remote attacker can send a request crafted with an XXE payload to invoke a malicious DTD hosted on a system that they control. This results in reading local files that the application has access to.", "datePublished": "2022-05-24T14:49:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T07:11:39", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://support.morpheusdata.com/s/?language=en_US", "https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/5.4.4/release_notes/current.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31261"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1c47724a-1520-390b-8aae-f767e47a3c77", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "246357ce-27fc-35f8-8c9f-c341150930d1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
