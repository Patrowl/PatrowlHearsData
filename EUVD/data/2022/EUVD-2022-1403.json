Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is lenient in checking the digest algorithm structure. This can allow a crafted structure that steals padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded message to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used. The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-03-18T13:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:46:25", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/security/advisories/GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24771", "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/3f0b49a0573ef1bb7af7f5673c0cfebf00424df1", "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/commit/bb822c02df0b61211836472e29b9790cc541cdb2", "https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1681", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:1739", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6156", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6835", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:6813"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24771", "GHSA-cfm4-qjh2-4765"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e37dc8b6-a225-344c-8552-af4e8c5ace50", "product": {"name": "forge"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11241776-b4d0-3fc0-ab47-da339e9a8fc0", "vendor": {"name": "digitalbazaar"}}], "isExploited": false}
