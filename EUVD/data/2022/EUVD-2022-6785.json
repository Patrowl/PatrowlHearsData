In all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+), attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check. This vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.", "datePublished": "2022-09-26T13:25:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:20:18", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/security/advisories/GHSA-cxgf-v2p8-7ph7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39243", "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/pull/143", "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess/commit/29bc09de561bf00ff9bf77123756363a9709f868", "https://github.com/brettwooldridge/NuProcess"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39243", "GHSA-cxgf-v2p8-7ph7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b0292e4-6eb8-34b0-98f3-532cbaa45e1e", "product": {"name": "NuProcess"}, "product_version": "1.2.0, < 2.0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "446a0af7-979f-38b4-86b7-96269da41b9f", "vendor": {"name": "brettwooldridge"}}], "isExploited": false}
