Versions prior to 0.28.0 contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs, Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There are no workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-12-15T00:01:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-18T15:59:54", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/security/advisories/GHSA-xqqc-c5gw-c5r5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23507", "https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/commit/5c32f31b97ac3172775699fe0d4ba6003ca4fb18", "https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23507", "GHSA-xqqc-c5gw-c5r5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "74fc3361-079f-3197-9457-05a98cdf0457", "product": {"name": "tendermint-rs"}, "product_version": "0.28.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b43443a-c469-3794-bc10-9c00bc2e65a1", "vendor": {"name": "informalsystems"}}], "isExploited": false}
