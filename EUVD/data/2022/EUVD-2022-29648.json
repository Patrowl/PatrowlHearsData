In versions up to and including 1.1.1 the `org.conroller.js` code would erroneously log user secrets. This has been resolved in commit `46d98f2b` and should be available in subsequent versions of the software. Users of the software are advised to manually apply the `46d98f2b` commit or to update when a new version becomes available. As a workaround users should inspect their logs and remove logged secrets as appropriate.", "datePublished": "2022-04-21T17:20:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:32:43", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/security/advisories/GHSA-rhj9-qx37-7m2m", "https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-services/commit/46d98f2b1427fc6ba1c2bc443dc6688fd400f1f4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24875"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1548b260-fbd0-3b1b-9a7a-a1cc948710ab", "product": {"name": "cve-services"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36500f75-f1af-3352-b968-8e3b8226a012", "vendor": {"name": "CVEProject"}}], "isExploited": false}
