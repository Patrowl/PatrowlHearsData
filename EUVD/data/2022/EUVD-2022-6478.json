The functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or `r, vs` as separate arguments. The potentially affected contracts are those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this protection. The issue has been patched in 4.7.3.", "datePublished": "2022-08-14T00:05:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:50:36", "baseScore": 7.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35961", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3610", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/d693d89d99325f395182e4f547dbf5ff8e5c3c87", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.7.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35961", "GHSA-4h98-2769-gh6h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6109dec4-50e5-37b0-8ffc-864c1d5106ec", "product": {"name": "openzeppelin-contracts"}, "product_version": "4.1.0, < 4.7.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4a0088b-9b64-3ea0-ab45-4fd171289073", "vendor": {"name": "OpenZeppelin"}}], "isExploited": false}
