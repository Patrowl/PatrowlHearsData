The ExecSync request runs commands in a container and logs the output of the command. This output is then read by CRI-O after command execution, and it is read in a manner where the entire file corresponding to the output of the command is read in. Thus, if the output of the command is large it is possible to exhaust the memory or the disk space of the node when CRI-O reads the output of the command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is system availability.", "datePublished": "2022-06-07T17:43:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:10:03", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/security/advisories/GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1708", "https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/commit/f032cf649ecc7e0c46718bd9e7814bfb317cb544", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2085361", "https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4943", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4947", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4951", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4965", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4972", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4999", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1708.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7457", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7469", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7529"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-1708", "GHSA-fcm2-6c3h-pg6j"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.59, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dc9f0215-1939-30da-a672-31696b342e8e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
