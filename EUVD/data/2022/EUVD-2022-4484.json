In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length. Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish, leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any data at all.", "datePublished": "2021-11-09T16:41:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:03:32", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43172", "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/665/commits/2f1c47378e3439cb89e084cdad6b759bbc8a72b8", "https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/routinator/CVE-2021-43172_CVE-2021-43173_CVE-2021-43174.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43172", "GHSA-m3x9-623g-35c4"], "assigner": "NLnet Labs", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69e1b0a2-6ec2-3bbc-be10-6767568492dd", "product": {"name": "Routinator"}, "product_version": "unspecified \u22640.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "546a55c6-c464-332d-8216-875d2f7b7cef", "vendor": {"name": "NLnet Labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
