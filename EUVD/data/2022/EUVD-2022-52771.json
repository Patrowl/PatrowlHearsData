In Sourcegraph versions before 3.41.0, it is possible for an attacker to delete other users\u2019 saved searches due to a bug in the authorization check. The vulnerability does not allow the reading of other users\u2019 saved searches, only overwriting them with attacker-controlled searches. The issue is patched in Sourcegraph version 3.41.0. There is no workaround for this issue and updating to a secure version is highly recommended.", "datePublished": "2022-08-01T18:40:28", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:56:41", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/security/advisories/GHSA-37qp-9jq6-f6mx", "https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/commit/2832d7882396a6295ba5803b5ef48dc7d5a24c59"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31155"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d15aad2-fbfa-3f35-b72d-4610f4a14906", "product": {"name": "sourcegraph"}, "product_version": "< 3.41.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "82133e79-5a97-353b-aa5e-25d141fbf542", "vendor": {"name": "sourcegraph"}}], "isExploited": false}
