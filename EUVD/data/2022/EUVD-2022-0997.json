ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.", "datePublished": "2021-01-25T18:30:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T18:09:15", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/deislabs/oras/security/advisories/GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21272", "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/commit/96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e", "https://github.com/deislabs/oras", "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/releases/tag/v0.9.0", "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/oras", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0099", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-21272.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:3016"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-21272", "GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e75d81d3-12c7-3e54-ab86-152ade43f266", "product": {"name": "oras"}, "product_version": "0.4.0, < 0.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f1cc296a-382c-35ac-95a0-fa24767fca30", "vendor": {"name": "deislabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
