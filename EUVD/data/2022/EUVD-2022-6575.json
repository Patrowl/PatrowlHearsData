When a Solana Pay transaction is located using a reference key, it may be checked to represent a transfer of the desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied `validateTransfer` function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been patched as of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should upgrade to it. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-08-01T21:10:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:54:43", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/security/advisories/GHSA-j47c-j42c-mwqq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35917", "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/commit/ac6ce0d0a81137700874a8bf5a7caac3be999fad", "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay", "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/master/SPEC.md#reference", "https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-pay/blob/master/core/src/validateTransfer.ts"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35917", "GHSA-j47c-j42c-mwqq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a0d8156-9c85-31bf-92d8-06f15810c676", "product": {"name": "solana-pay"}, "product_version": "< 0.2.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1c67209b-e687-36a0-85b3-e1d855bfbed3", "vendor": {"name": "solana-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
