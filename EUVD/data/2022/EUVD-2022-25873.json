This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the BFD rate limiter functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause BFD traffic to be dropped, resulting in BFD session flaps. BFD session flaps can cause route instability and dropped traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.", "datePublished": "2022-02-23T17:40:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:29:33", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-bfd-dos-wGQXrzxn"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20623"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 13.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8073de8c-88db-3149-9ecb-6106c78d6557", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f05c22e-bcaa-3509-9048-12a7115878c8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
