In versions 2020.0.0 and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the client\u2019s private key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key exchange algorithms.", "datePublished": "2022-05-31T16:35:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:55:45", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/security/advisories/GHSA-72p8-v4hg-v45p", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29245", "https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/commit/03c6d60736b8f7b42e44d6989a53f9b644a091fb", "https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/commit/f1f273cf349532b9d41c1de51d3b83a9accedc88", "https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET", "https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/blob/bc99ada7da3f05f50d9379f2644941d91d5bf05a/src/Renci.SshNet/Security/KeyExchangeECCurve25519.cs#L51", "https://github.com/sshnet/SSH.NET/releases/tag/2020.0.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29245", "GHSA-72p8-v4hg-v45p"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9d26167-c5d6-3d99-950c-4c31767f6c1d", "product": {"name": "SSH.NET"}, "product_version": "2020.0.0, < 2020.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4cccb7bf-4f6d-31a8-bdaa-186b6507fc5c", "vendor": {"name": "sshnet"}}], "isExploited": false}
