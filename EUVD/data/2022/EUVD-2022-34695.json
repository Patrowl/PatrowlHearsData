This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T17:18:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:39:07", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/10a36e37-4188-403f-9b17-d7e79b8b8a6d?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/string-locator/trunk/editor.php#L59", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2759486%40string-locator&new=2759486%40string-locator&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2434"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2434"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 4.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ce47f9a-1657-3891-a39f-a02f9f26dfc3", "product": {"name": "String locator"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f577c0ce-5985-3747-a31f-800ee66ae51d", "vendor": {"name": "instawp"}}], "isExploited": false}
