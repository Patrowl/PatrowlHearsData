Starting with version 4.0 and prior to version 4.11, Zulip is vulnerable to a race condition during account deactivation, where a simultaneous access by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued access by the deactivated user. A patch is available in version 4.11 on the 4.x branch and version 5.0-rc1 on the 5.x branch. Upgrading to a fixed version will, as a side effect, deactivate any cached sessions that may have been leaked through this bug. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-03-16T13:30:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:53:29", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-6v98-m5x5-phqj", "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/62ba8e455d8f460001d9fb486a6dabfd1ed67717", "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/e6eace307ef435eec3395c99247155efed9219e4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24751"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f64b4884-a04f-3ddb-b56a-202643eef6b3", "product": {"name": "zulip"}, "product_version": "4.0, < 4.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "205076de-291d-3b43-8f1d-9197facb5341", "vendor": {"name": "zulip"}}], "isExploited": false}
