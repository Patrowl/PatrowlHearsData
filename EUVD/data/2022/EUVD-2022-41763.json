A malicious admin could use this vulnerability to perform port enumeration on the local host or other hosts on the internal network, as well as against hosts on the Internet.

As a workaround, self-hosters can use `DISCOURSE_BLOCKED_IP_BLOCKS` env var (which overrides `blocked_ip_blocks` setting) to stop webhooks from accessing private IPs.", "datePublished": "2022-11-02T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:41:51", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-rcc5-28r3-23rr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39241"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c3225c0-ffe4-3f60-b9b6-dec774c79761", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.9.0.beta10"}, {"id": "f494e8a5-5771-3121-b88f-4ea1f8c65f76", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.8.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "313268e4-99b5-3697-b649-cc472f556902", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
