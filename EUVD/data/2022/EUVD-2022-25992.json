This vulnerability is due to an improper implementation of Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) ciphers. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a sufficient number of encrypted messages across an affected IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel and then using cryptanalytic techniques to break the encryption. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt, read, modify, and re-encrypt data that is transmitted across an affected IPsec IKEv2 VPN tunnel.", "datePublished": "2022-05-03T03:16:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:19:31", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ipsec-mitm-CKnLr4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20742"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07dab7fc-7688-30c6-9dde-94e0e3dca5c8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "648f370a-494e-3ba3-9a37-eccf19a7112e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
