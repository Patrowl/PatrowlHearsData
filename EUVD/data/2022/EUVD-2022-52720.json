Prior to version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and 2.9.0beta5 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, inviting users on sites that use single sign-on could bypass the `must_approve_users` check and invites by staff are always approved automatically. The issue is patched in Discourse version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and version `2.9.0.beta5` on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, disable invites or increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.", "datePublished": "2022-06-03T14:35:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:19:28", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-x7jh-mx5q-6f9q", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16974", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/16984", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/0fa0094531efc82d9371f90a02aa804b176d59cf", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/7c4e2d33fa4b922354c177ffc880a2f2701a91f9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31025"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4c385951-e7aa-3146-b438-a9c3b25383cd", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.4"}, {"id": "6a5f4f03-80b9-35b9-8fec-f3e78cd1bf2a", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "2.9.0.beta1, \u2264 2.9.0.beta4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "97eba412-2d55-3742-9072-5148646fb5b4", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
