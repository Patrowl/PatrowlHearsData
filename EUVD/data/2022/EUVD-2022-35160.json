This is due to improper validation on the value supplied through the 'author' parameter found in the ~/cerber-load.php file. In vulnerable versions, the plugin only blocks requests if the value supplied is numeric, making it possible for attackers to supply additional non-numeric characters to bypass the protection. The non-numeric characters are stripped and the user requested is displayed. This can be used by unauthenticated attackers to gather information about users that can targeted in further attacks.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T17:19:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:52:59", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2939", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2772930/wp-cerber/trunk/cerber-load.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2939"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b23dc11b-12aa-3955-8d06-b280a4699aa6", "product": {"name": "WP Cerber Security, Anti-spam & Malware Scan"}, "product_version": "9.0 \u22649.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "edfe359f-13be-39a3-ac59-0bbba79067e1", "vendor": {"name": "gioni"}}], "isExploited": false}
