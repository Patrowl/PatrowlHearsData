Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1.", "datePublished": "2022-07-21T14:00:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:57:25", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-qh9x-gcfh-pcrw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31170", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3552", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31170", "GHSA-qh9x-gcfh-pcrw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b9931875-b67f-36e5-b122-3714b5188547", "product": {"name": "openzeppelin-contracts"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.7.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "357bc19a-112f-3cfa-9a69-bf8eac4032c0", "vendor": {"name": "OpenZeppelin"}}], "isExploited": false}
