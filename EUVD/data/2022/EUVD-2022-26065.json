This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-07-06T20:30:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:11:27", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-xss-ksKd5yfA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20815"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5e53ea9-ee64-3e0e-a506-123ea60d0d4e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ee8fb6a0-bafd-364c-a6e7-4de840abcb08", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
