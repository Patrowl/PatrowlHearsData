Helm controller is tightly integrated with the Helm SDK. A vulnerability found in the Helm SDK that affects flux2 v0.0.17 until v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.0.4 until v0.23.0 allows for specific data inputs to cause high memory consumption. In some platforms, this could cause the controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations. In a shared cluster multi-tenancy environment, a tenant could create a HelmRelease that makes the controller panic, denying all other tenants from their Helm releases being reconciled. Patches are available in flux2 v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.23.0.", "datePublished": "2022-09-07T20:15:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:14:00", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-p2g7-xwvr-rrw3", "https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36049", "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=44996", "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=48360", "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36049", "GHSA-p2g7-xwvr-rrw3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5501ddd5-b2f0-3d78-92fe-6fbaecb72a87", "product": {"name": "flux2"}, "product_version": "0.0.4, < 0.23.0"}, {"id": "9633e10f-ee0c-31cf-95aa-b55713ec6104", "product": {"name": "flux2"}, "product_version": "0.0.17, < 0.32.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "73ec5cb1-f043-36c7-a973-8caf6db28859", "vendor": {"name": "fluxcd"}}], "isExploited": false}
