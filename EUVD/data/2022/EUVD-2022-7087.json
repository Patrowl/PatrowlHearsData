Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of Service. Users that have permissions to change Flux\u2019s objects, either through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type to stop being processed. This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a workaround, Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and `.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the recommended mitigation.", "datePublished": "2022-10-21T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:45:22", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/security/advisories/GHSA-f4p5-x4vc-mh4v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39272", "https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/issues/131", "https://github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller/pull/533", "https://github.com/fluxcd/image-automation-controller/pull/439", "https://github.com/fluxcd/image-reflector-controller/pull/314", "https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/731", "https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/420", "https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/pull/903", "https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2", "https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery#131", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1071"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39272", "GHSA-f4p5-x4vc-mh4v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f1924aa-0a77-3b27-bba8-ac478241774b", "product": {"name": "flux2"}, "product_version": "< 0.35.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "31c144c9-1323-3915-901b-ab8f93ca1308", "vendor": {"name": "fluxcd"}}], "isExploited": false}
