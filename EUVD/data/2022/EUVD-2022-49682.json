There is a Path Traversal for an Unzip operation. The Vocera Report Console contains a websocket function that allows for the restoration of the database from a ZIP archive that expects a SQL import file. During the unzip operation, the code takes file paths from the ZIP archive and writes them to a Vocera temporary directory. Unfortunately, the code does not properly check if the file paths include directory traversal payloads that would escape the intended destination.", "datePublished": "2023-07-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-30T14:06:44", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/governance/cyber-security/product-security/", "https://www.stryker.com/us/en/about/governance/cyber-security/product-security/vocera-report-server-vulnerabilities--cve-2022-46898--cve-2022-4.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-46902"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f989075-9ded-3c61-90e6-39d1a5a440b0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1bbe7e52-a6c4-346f-a815-f9d992a2e406", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
