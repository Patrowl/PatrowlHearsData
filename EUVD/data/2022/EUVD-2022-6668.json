Prior to version 1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the key forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key forwarding in their forks using `CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.", "datePublished": "2022-09-28T20:00:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:54:47", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/security/advisories/GHSA-2pvj-p485-cp3m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39246", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/commit/77df720a238d17308deab83ecaa37f7a4740a17e", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2/releases/tag/v1.5.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39246", "GHSA-2pvj-p485-cp3m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7e8f5aac-4589-3df0-a600-db5f3c1e1e90", "product": {"name": "matrix-android-sdk2"}, "product_version": "< 1.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c42f8662-368c-3f8b-8395-d66d49ef97b1", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
