When displaying messages with embedded remote images, Zulip normally loads the image preview via a go-camo proxy server. However, an attacker who can send messages could include a crafted URL that tricks the server into embedding a remote image reference directly. This could allow the attacker to infer the viewer\u2019s IP address and browser fingerprinting information. This vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Server 5.6. Zulip organizations with image and link previews [disabled](https://zulip.com/help/allow-image-link-previews) are not affected.", "datePublished": "2022-08-31T19:15:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T17:46:52", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-vg5m-mf9x-j452"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36048"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b1c35b9c-dc6c-3fe1-8204-3940166b9162", "product": {"name": "zulip"}, "product_version": "< 5.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cacb8c59-b089-3146-9062-5ea978a48a81", "vendor": {"name": "zulip"}}], "isExploited": false}
