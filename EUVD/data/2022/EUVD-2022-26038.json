This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-04-21T18:50:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:22:41", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-xss-6MCe4kPF"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20788"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "04854e8e-ef0a-3fba-a82f-5c9e290d23d2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b20eeb9d-b2f0-3f70-9fec-70386a2576ea", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
