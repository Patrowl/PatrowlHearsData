Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.", "datePublished": "2022-01-14T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:33:29", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/markedjs/marked/security/advisories/GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21681", "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/8f806573a3f6c6b7a39b8cdb66ab5ebb8d55a5f5", "https://github.com/markedjs/marked/commit/c4a3ccd344b6929afa8a1d50ac54a721e57012c0", "https://github.com/markedjs/marked", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AIXDMC3CSHYW3YWVSQOXAWLUYQHAO5UX/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21681", "GHSA-5v2h-r2cx-5xgj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eaf89f5e-e0de-39d8-bb50-151266226a3b", "product": {"name": "marked"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9d251387-bad0-3d9b-b7d0-403576e3882f", "vendor": {"name": "markedjs"}}], "isExploited": false}
