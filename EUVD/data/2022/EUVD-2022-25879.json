These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-05-03T03:16:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:18:26", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-xss-qXz4uAkM"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20629"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f9e2332-8b75-38fc-b4ca-cf6c77b33fe9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "413d9619-0c98-398d-81c4-0358afa0fd48", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
