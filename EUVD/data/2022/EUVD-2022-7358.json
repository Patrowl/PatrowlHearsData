{"id": "EUVD-2022-7358", "enisaUuid": "26457dde-8b20-36f7-8fad-841319209e62", "description": "A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.\n\n", "datePublished": "2022-11-01T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:13:08", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3786", "https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/1452", "https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-src-rs/commit/4a31c14f31e1a08c18893a37e304dd1dd4b7daa3", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fe3b639dc19b325846f4f6801f2f4604f56e3de3", "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20221101.txt", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/794340", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-openssl-W9sdCc2a", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221102-0001", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202211-01", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0065.html", "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0023", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DWP23EZYOBDJQP7HP4YU7W2ABU2YDITS", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/63YRPWPUSX3MBHNPIEJZDKQT6YA7UF6S", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DWP23EZYOBDJQP7HP4YU7W2ABU2YDITS", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/63YRPWPUSX3MBHNPIEJZDKQT6YA7UF6S", "https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-src-rs", "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c42165b5706e42f67ef8ef4c351a9a4c5d21639a", "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=c42165b5706e42f67ef8ef4c351a9a4c5d21639a", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/169687/OpenSSL-Security-Advisory-20221101.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/15", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/16", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/17", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/18", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/19", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/20", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/21", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/24", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/10", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/11", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/12", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/13", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/14", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/15", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/2", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/3", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/6", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/7", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/02/9", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/10", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/11", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/2", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/3", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/5", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/6", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/7", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/03/9", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7288", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7384", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-3786.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-3786", "GHSA-h8jm-2x53-xhp5"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 20.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "88775e43-3a5e-31b2-af2c-dfb8b2e8ecc5", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.0.0 <3.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7c862b59-af01-3174-8319-619c9b92b1cf", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
