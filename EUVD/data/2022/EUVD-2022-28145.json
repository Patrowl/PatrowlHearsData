PV guests can request two forms of mappings. When both are in use for any individual mapping, unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two steps. The reference count for such a mapping would then mistakenly be decremented twice. Underflow of the counters gets detected, resulting in the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.", "datePublished": "2022-01-25T13:43:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T03:28:43", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-23034.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5117", "https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-394.txt", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/25/3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OMR6UBGJW6JKND7IILGQ2CU35EQPF3E3/", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-23034"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7e9baa6-4962-37aa-a03f-b83037c41824", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
