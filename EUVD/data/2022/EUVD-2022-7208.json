The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type\u2019s essence as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.", "datePublished": "2022-11-22T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:36:24", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-3fjj-p79j-c9hh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41919", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/62dde76f1f7aca76e38625fe8d983761f26e6fc9", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastify/csrf", "https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40fastify/csrf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41919", "GHSA-3fjj-p79j-c9hh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "154aa5f0-5332-3a16-becb-abbea2b3edf8", "product": {"name": "fastify"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.10.2"}, {"id": "62a908b7-797f-3e73-a942-34d05b1736af", "product": {"name": "fastify"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.29.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94ea52e1-0aea-303f-adb9-b9b2ddc38b9a", "vendor": {"name": "fastify"}}], "isExploited": false}
