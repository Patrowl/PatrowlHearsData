In versions prior to and including 2.12.1 a stack buffer overflow vulnerability affects PJSIP users that use STUN in their applications, either by: setting a STUN server in their account/media config in PJSUA/PJSUA2 level, or directly using `pjlib-util/stun_simple` API. A patch is available in commit 450baca which should be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-06-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:46", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-26j7-ww69-c4qj", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/450baca94f475345542c6953832650c390889202", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/02/msg00029.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5358", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31031"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9159c167-cf54-3691-b86e-29e659e847c5", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.12.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ceec2ee0-f677-35b1-bd94-35d21e7af7fc", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
