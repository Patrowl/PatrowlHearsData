A category's group permissions settings can be viewed by anyone that has access to the category. As a result, a normal user is able to see whether a group has read/write permissions in the category even though the information should only be available to the users that can manage a category. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds for this problem.", "datePublished": "2022-04-14T21:25:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:39:31", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-34xr-ff4w-mcpf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24850"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "08fe728a-1ff6-3afb-b135-8d0f3151c89e", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "< 2.9.0.beta4"}, {"id": "c43461e4-d487-39d2-913c-8adfd552e767", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "270c456c-e767-32a0-9fdd-9585c4cb8449", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
