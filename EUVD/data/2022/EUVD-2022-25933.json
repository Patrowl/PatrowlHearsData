This vulnerability is due to insufficient packet verification for traffic inspected by the AVC feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets from the wired network to a wireless client, resulting in the crafted packets being processed by the wireless controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:16:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:26:03", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c9800-fnf-dos-bOL5vLge"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20683"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "715c56ef-bc00-34b1-9a28-2f42ee197714", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7410c65d-f547-367d-b2cf-58bc7f7a5028", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
