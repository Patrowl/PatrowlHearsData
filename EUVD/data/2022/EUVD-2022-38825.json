Azure RTOS USBX implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer underflow and a buffer overflow in the `_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1` allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed (string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm -> ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values may be used as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-10-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:18:49", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/security/advisories/GHSA-chpp-5fv9-6368", "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/blob/master/common/usbx_host_classes/src/ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get.c#L264", "https://github.com/azure-rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36063"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "87e0298c-c105-3047-b23c-7cde99e032b1", "product": {"name": "usbx"}, "product_version": "< 6.1.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "78750623-2a81-3b36-90c3-b41ad03ebf51", "vendor": {"name": "azure-rtos"}}], "isExploited": false}
