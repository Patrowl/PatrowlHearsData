This vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can create a KNIME workflow that, when being opened by a user, can overwrite arbitrary files that the user has write access to. It's not necessary to execute the workflow, opening the workflow is sufficient. The user will notice that something is wrong because an error is being reported but only after the files have already been written.\n\nThis can impact data integrity (file contents are changed) or cause errors in other software (vital files being corrupted). It can even lead to remote code execution if executable files are being replaced and subsequently executed by the user. In all cases the attacker has to know the location of files on the user's system, though.\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2022-11-24T06:39:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-24T18:25:41", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.knime.com/security/advisories"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-44749"], "assigner": "KNIME", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2847ad69-064c-3fd3-8aa9-59e78ed4b1bc", "product": {"name": "KNIME Analytics Platform"}, "product_version": "4.5.0 <4.5.3"}, {"id": "a0a5e67c-44b7-3c74-9d7d-7f905bcf981d", "product": {"name": "KNIME Analytics Platform"}, "product_version": "4.6.0 <4.6.4"}, {"id": "f6974fb3-a63d-39aa-a273-287a6bd6056f", "product": {"name": "KNIME Analytics Platform"}, "product_version": "3.2.0 <4.4.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "df98d961-f66d-34d0-983d-4c33c3c44f29", "vendor": {"name": "KNIME"}}], "isExploited": false}
