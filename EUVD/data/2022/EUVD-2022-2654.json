It is possible to inject arbitrary commands as part of the `_is_clamav_binary` function located within `Index.js`. It should be noted that this vulnerability requires a pre-requisite that a folder should be created with the same command that will be chained to execute. This lowers the risk of this issue.", "datePublished": "2020-04-07T13:19:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T09:33:19", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7613", "https://github.com/kylefarris/clamscan/pull/45", "https://github.com/kylefarris/clamscan/commit/5f557c970817fe8c578ec3f7ad3bcbcef4cf5538", "https://github.com/kylefarris/clamscan", "https://github.com/kylefarris/clamscan/blob/master/index.js#L34", "https://huntr.dev/bounties/1-npm-clamscan", "https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-CLAMSCAN-564113", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-7613"], "aliases": ["CVE-2020-7613", "GHSA-5v25-xr56-phph"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 1.8, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ae202133-f3c1-32e0-98d9-693f963ff780", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
