This makes it possible with attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the wp-config.php file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve remote code execution.", "datePublished": "2022-11-29T20:13:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-23T21:24:32", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/A:H/I:H/C:N/S:U/UI:N/PR:L/AC:L/AV:N", "references": ["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2804020%40simplepress&new=2804020%40simplepress&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-4030"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-4030"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 5.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c7ccaa35-04a8-3064-b05b-c0370096faaa", "product": {"name": "Simple:Press \u2013 WordPress Forum Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5fe51526-a703-341a-942d-8f889613817b", "vendor": {"name": "simplepress"}}], "isExploited": false}
