{"id": "EUVD-2022-6714", "enisaUuid": "19d6343c-ebcb-3d69-ba39-e61f4edc9265", "description": "Matrix Javascript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the matrix-js-sdk implementing a too permissive key forwarding strategy on the receiving end. Starting with version 19.7.0, the default policy for accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-js-sdk. matrix-js-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately, for example, by showing a warning for such messages. This attack requires coordination between a malicious homeserver and an attacker, and those who trust your homeservers do not need a workaround.", "datePublished": "2022-09-28T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:55:11", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6263-x97c-c4gg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39249", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/commit/a587d7c36026fe1fcf93dfff63588abee359be76", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v19.7.0", "https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/28/upgrade-now-to-address-encryption-vulns-in-matrix-sdks-and-clients", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-35", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2022-39249.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7178", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7181", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7182", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7183", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7184", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7190", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-39249.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-39249"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39249", "GHSA-6263-x97c-c4gg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "76ae867b-8bb3-3aa3-9ab5-7e43e4d44ea8", "product": {"name": "matrix-js-sdk"}, "product_version": "< 19.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "339b3c0e-669d-3547-9946-dd084f021fa7", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
