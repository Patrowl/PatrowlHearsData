This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain TCP segments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted TCP traffic at a high rate through an interface of an affected device. That interface would need to have AppNav interception enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:16:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:25:43", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-appnav-xe-dos-j5MXTR4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20678"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "104547cd-2899-3d41-983b-b55f302147a0", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "35df6e4d-67b5-3ff6-9173-f401e1ae53c0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
