Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a \u2018from\u2019 statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.", "datePublished": "2022-11-08T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:39:59", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-3gfj-fxx4-f22w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39352", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/776e80505e8d184b2286acc8268d8d74f36a9984", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v0.2.5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-39352", "GHSA-3gfj-fxx4-f22w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19cd9614-0713-3fcf-9d50-dcc341b6137f", "product": {"name": "openfga"}, "product_version": "< 0.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2037239e-ac52-399e-a214-77c2b1bca20a", "vendor": {"name": "openfga"}}], "isExploited": false}
