This leads to an increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker can expect repeatable success by exploiting the vulnerability. The recommended solution is to update the firmware to a version >= 1.13.4 as soon as possible (available in SICK Support Portal).", "datePublished": "2022-12-16T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-16T14:36:30", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sick.com/psirt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-47377"], "assigner": "SICK AG", "epss": 1.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9e740e6e-1033-33ad-9842-52049d173052", "product": {"name": "SICK SIM2000ST (LFT PPC)"}, "product_version": "Partnumber 2086502 with firmware version < 1.13.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f437bc81-9dc2-37ef-b31d-91c2bbaba18b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
