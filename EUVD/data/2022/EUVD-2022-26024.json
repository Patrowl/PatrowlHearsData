This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform configuration changes on the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2022-04-06T18:12:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:28:57", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-voip-phone-csrf-K56vXvVx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20774"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b4a6228-dded-360b-b3ff-4653447acf38", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "437434a5-c981-3424-94d1-b32227069b39", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
