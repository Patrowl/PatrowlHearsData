The attacker must be authenticated on the affected system as a low-privileged user to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because a file leveraged by a root user is executed when a low-privileged user runs specific commands on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands to a specific file as a lower-privileged user and then waiting until an admin user executes specific commands. The commands would then be executed on the device by the root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges on the affected system from a low-privileged user to the root user.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:20:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:24:32", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-privesc-vman-tEJFpBSL"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20739"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42dffa2e-2778-3de3-9a47-fed4410083a6", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN vManage"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f84e723a-2136-3101-b035-064f1d4e3872", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
