Starting in version 2.2 and prior to versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6, an attacker who is able to obtain the meeting identifier for a meeting on a server can find information related to an external video being shared, like the current timestamp and play/pause. The problem has been patched in versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6 by modifying the stream to send the data only for users in the meeting. There are currently no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-06-01T23:25:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T06:17:54", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-x82p-j22f-v4q6", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13788", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/14265", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3.18", "https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.4-rc-6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-29235"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2820466f-1931-39f3-89ec-a50c92e6ebb9", "product": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}, "product_version": "2.2, < 2.3.18"}, {"id": "8f31db06-8752-3c08-9ee0-65459d353e66", "product": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}, "product_version": "2.4-alpha-1, < 2.4-rc-6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3dbc907-4cbd-3f52-8754-f43c8c1b3f3b", "vendor": {"name": "bigbluebutton"}}], "isExploited": false}
