In affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions: `3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.", "datePublished": "2022-10-06T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:53:12", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/security/advisories/GHSA-v9gv-xp36-jgj8", "https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/4841", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-31008.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31008"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "40d6b5ab-5b9c-38bd-9080-38511926d8e0", "product": {"name": "rabbitmq-server"}, "product_version": "< 3.8.32"}, {"id": "85bc8092-d7fe-3a19-9a2b-f23efe876e2e", "product": {"name": "rabbitmq-server"}, "product_version": "3.9.0, < 3.9.18"}, {"id": "cf913d08-8904-30e9-93db-8f56a2984435", "product": {"name": "rabbitmq-server"}, "product_version": "3.10.0, < 3.10.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c944221d-512e-35b6-8a7a-babd9754df16", "vendor": {"name": "rabbitmq"}}], "isExploited": false}
