{"id": "EUVD-2022-6977", "enisaUuid": "3dcef9b5-cbc0-3184-82f0-b3acc6337d33", "description": "linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap` and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`, `Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 * size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.", "datePublished": "2022-09-07T22:50:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:23:22", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/security/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36086", "https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator/commit/013b0758643943e8df5b17bbb495460ff47e8bbf", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j", "https://github.com/rust-osdev/linked-list-allocator", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2022-0063.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-36086.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-36086", "GHSA-xg8p-34w2-j49j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ea77eae-b92f-3987-83e3-d4d14b99c656", "product": {"name": "linked-list-allocator"}, "product_version": "< 0.10.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f93a447-7d3e-38e7-83db-5dbda397d341", "vendor": {"name": "rust-osdev"}}], "isExploited": false}
