To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be first authenticated to the application. For the first one, the attacker has to simply inject XSS code within the URL field of a shared item. For the second one however, the attacker must prepare a payload within its profile, and then ask an administrator to modify its profile. From there, whenever the administrator accesses the log, it can be XSS'ed.", "datePublished": "2017-11-27T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T19:42:22", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-15051", "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/commit/5f16f6bb132138ee04eb1e0debf2bdc7d7b7a15f", "https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass", "http://blog.amossys.fr/teampass-multiple-cve-01.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-15051", "GHSA-r68m-4v39-cf43"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7eaed5a2-2521-3506-940c-1bb8c95b7828", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fc2fed08-d911-3b86-abaf-63cbec77812b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
