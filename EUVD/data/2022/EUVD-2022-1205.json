Note that since this page does not have a CSRF check it's quite easy to perform a lot of those requests. ### Patches This issue has been patched in XWiki 12.10.5 and 13.2RC1. Two different patches are provided: - a first one to fix the CSRF problem - a more complex one that now relies on sending an email for the Forgot username process. ### Workarounds It's possible to fix the problem without uprading by editing the ForgotUsername page in version below 13.x, to use the following code: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/ForgotUsername.xml#L39-L123 In version after 13.x it's also possible to edit manually the forgotusername.vm file, but it's really encouraged to upgrade the version here. ### References * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18384 * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18408 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org) * Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "datePublished": "2022-02-04T22:15:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T18:27:32", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-jqfg-mhrh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32732", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f0440dfcbba705e03f7565cd88893dde57ca3fa8", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18384", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18408", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32732.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-32732", "GHSA-vh5c-jqfg-mhrh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0fb1c38b-a86c-3ef0-a148-a9c120b2ecb7", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "13.0, < 13.2RC1"}, {"id": "461a9ba8-535e-343c-98d5-9cb35f8ae692", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "< 12.10.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8528c6cf-f46f-3ad6-b0df-0900b0c8db84", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
