This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2022-07-06T20:30:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:12:05", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cucm-xss-RgH7MpKA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20800"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "453d26b7-fb7a-3f03-a698-56544c8cbdfb", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Connection"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dd9c3f7e-1749-3a64-b318-6baa0e204f4c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
