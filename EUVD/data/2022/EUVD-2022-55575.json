So let's start this with some\nclarifications:\n\n* The terms \"master\" or \"peer\" denote a shared mount. A shared mount\n  belongs to a peer group.\n\n* A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.\n  They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available\n  in @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.\n  Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.\n  The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt->mnt_share.\n\n* The terms \"slave mount\" or \"dependent mount\" denote a mount that\n  receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts\n  may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their\n  master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on\n  that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt->mnt_slave_list.\n\n* The term \"master mount\" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it\n  denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term\n  \"master mount\" - or \"master\" for short - is mostly used when talking\n  in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master\n  mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a\n  slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can\n  be identified via @slave_mount->mnt_master. Different slaves may point\n  to different masters in the same peer group.\n\n* Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists.\n  Non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to\n  ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the\n  ->mnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.\n\n* Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive\n  propagation from via @slave_mnt->mnt_master (see above). Together with\n  these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest\n  peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id\n  @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave\n  mount receives propagation from.\n\n* A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also\n  a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive\n  propagation from another peer group.\n\n  If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all\n  peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via\n  ->mnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same\n  ->mnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.\n\n* A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group\n  but is not a peer in another peer group.\n\n* A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single\n  peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point\n  to a peer in that peer group via ->mnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts\n  such that @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id is equal to\n  @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.\n\n  The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a\n  single propagation level in a propagation tree.\n\n  For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and\n  all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group pr\n---truncated---", "datePublished": "2025-09-15T15:31:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-04T15:30:30", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cad0d17fb2b0540180ab59e2cd48ad348cc1ee4c", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cc997490be65da0af8c75a6244fc80bb66c53ce0", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f57df69de7f05302fad584eb8e3f34de39e0311", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2dae4211b579ce98985876a73a78466e285238ff", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b591b2919d018ef91b4a9571edca94105bcad3df", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c24cc476acd8bccb5af54849aac5e779d8223bf5", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e7c9f10c44a8919cd8bbd51b228c84d0caf7d518", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/784a4f995ee24460aa72e00b085612fad57ebce5", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/11933cf1d91d57da9e5c53822a540bbdc2656c16", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50280"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-50280"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0964d50c-c48c-32f2-96fb-475ba5d75f8a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <cc997490be65da0af8c75a6244fc80bb66c53ce0"}, {"id": "18246540-063a-3774-b40e-c4d3769d47bf", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <e7c9f10c44a8919cd8bbd51b228c84d0caf7d518"}, {"id": "1a37ddc5-8604-3962-9f58-ada56861b0e4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 4.14.303"}, {"id": "1cbe4d6b-8957-3737-a243-eeb737726cd0", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.4.229"}, {"id": "4f794a28-789e-3b7d-96db-4632c6cd4420", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <784a4f995ee24460aa72e00b085612fad57ebce5"}, {"id": "51fecb41-5cd0-31bf-b70c-3dfe612fe89a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <2dae4211b579ce98985876a73a78466e285238ff"}, {"id": "551e968b-d729-3f38-b3dc-04d3d7f46613", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1.3"}, {"id": "56df6d79-594a-30e6-bc31-8ff0a150ecd4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <7f57df69de7f05302fad584eb8e3f34de39e0311"}, {"id": "86419b90-512f-3146-a8f7-05be1ea8fd51", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <b591b2919d018ef91b4a9571edca94105bcad3df"}, {"id": "8d8bf594-cf99-3c63-8281-65f2b377807d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.0.17"}, {"id": "91b9f892-fe60-3f7b-8a8a-421b21af8a2a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <11933cf1d91d57da9e5c53822a540bbdc2656c16"}, {"id": "97358535-182e-39e1-8c86-ddcedd541b5b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <c24cc476acd8bccb5af54849aac5e779d8223bf5"}, {"id": "9e0eb840-b993-396c-8548-bf00b382191e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.2"}, {"id": "aadca105-4ef4-304c-b25e-148b4fdfecfe", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "c52f9671-8592-3413-9d94-9f186caaee62", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "fc7b1646bf29f722277bdd19551e01420ce9da8f"}, {"id": "c65efb9b-825b-3848-9f7e-247238c6c9c3", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "f2ebb3a921c1ca1e2ddd9242e95a1989a50c4c68 <cad0d17fb2b0540180ab59e2cd48ad348cc1ee4c"}, {"id": "c7ff33a9-45eb-36c8-ad62-69e18298f1a4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.15.87"}, {"id": "c80ea03f-f866-3660-9ed4-7513e0131659", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 4.9.337"}, {"id": "ccbded07-8df4-3ebd-84ff-9c38b58e96b7", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "3.15"}, {"id": "fa3f4781-380f-389f-a7a5-67c6d1ca2988", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.10.163"}, {"id": "ff37718f-c6ef-3257-a7a9-4ca594a8ac6b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 4.19.270"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "82c4683e-e020-379d-ac94-427df6c9a87a", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
