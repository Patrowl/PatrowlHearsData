When the TCP sequence is predictable, an attacker can send packets that are forged to appear to come from a trusted computer. These forged packets could compromise services on the MSC800. SICK has released a new firmware version of the SICK MSC800 and recommends updating to the newest version.", "datePublished": "2022-04-11T19:37:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T05:32:59", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sick.com/psirt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-27577"], "assigner": "SICK AG", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a35975f7-ed7d-39d9-8143-66a814cb1952", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
