This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, the plugin only allows administrators access to edit Image Hovers, however, if a site admin makes the plugin's features available to lower privileged users through the 'Who Can Edit?' setting then this can be exploited by those users.", "datePublished": "2022-09-06T17:19:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-03T00:52:59", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2669411%40image-hover-effects-ultimate&new=2669411%40image-hover-effects-ultimate&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2935"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-2935"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e955203e-fef4-3a73-9d8f-8af763f4e1e2", "product": {"name": "Image Hover Effects Ultimate (Image Gallery, Effects, Lightbox, Comparison or Magnifier)"}, "product_version": "9.7.3 \u22649.7.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75d743c2-897c-33ab-8d93-377909814eba", "vendor": {"name": "biplob018"}}], "isExploited": false}
