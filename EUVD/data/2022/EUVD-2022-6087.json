In commits prior to 5c4177441417 passing some special values to the `filter` and `filterout` parameters can cause an abnormally high CPU. This results in an impact on the performance of the servers and RSSHub services which may lead to a denial of service. This issue has been fixed in commit 5c4177441417 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-06-29T18:00:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:52:47", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/security/advisories/GHSA-jvxx-v45p-v5vf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31110", "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues/10045", "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/4671720f4c5e1aaaad8fcc1dce684b6546baf2ff", "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/commit/5c4177441417b44a6e45c3c63e9eac2504abeb5b", "https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-31110", "GHSA-jvxx-v45p-v5vf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3a91b842-36b4-3703-9ef5-a8ae7129bf0a", "product": {"name": "RSSHub"}, "product_version": "commits prior to 5c4177441417b44a6e45c3c63e9eac2504abeb5b"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "df5719f3-877f-3c07-9731-cc7c8de4d36e", "vendor": {"name": "DIYgod"}}], "isExploited": false}
