This vulnerability is due to improper handling of undefined command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module. Note: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative access to the Cisco ASA. A user who has administrative access to a particular Cisco ASA is also expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module that is hosted by that Cisco ASA.", "datePublished": "2022-06-24T15:25:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-01T19:00:55", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asasfr-cmd-inject-PE4GfdG", "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2022/08/11/rapid7-discovered-vulnerabilities-in-cisco-asa-asdm-and-firepower-services-software/", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/168256/Cisco-ASA-X-With-FirePOWER-Services-Authenticated-Command-Injection.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20828"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 75.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea55bd56-1005-32a4-a50b-d15b8d89a024", "product": {"name": "Cisco FirePOWER Services Software for ASA"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25fafee4-ef3f-39c9-ab88-fe62d9a5a412", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
