This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed packets that are received on the Lightspeed-Plus line cards. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Lightspeed-Plus line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition for any traffic that traverses that line card.", "datePublished": "2022-04-15T14:15:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T16:27:13", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-lsplus-Z6AQEOjk"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-20714"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.91, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2f6ad3ca-f2c5-3ad4-b3df-9b53cdba679f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ca1acdd3-a36c-377c-bab3-b366950a83d9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
