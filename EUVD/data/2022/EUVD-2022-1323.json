In versions of evmos prior to 2.0.1 attackers are able to drain unclaimed funds from user addresses. To do this an attacker must create a new chain which does not enforce signature verification and connects it to the target evmos instance. The attacker can use this joined chain to transfer unclaimed funds. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-03-07T21:30:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T18:58:57", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/security/advisories/GHSA-5jgq-x857-p8xw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24738", "https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/commit/28870258d4ee9f1b8aeef5eba891681f89348f71", "https://github.com/tharsis/evmos", "https://github.com/tharsis/evmos/releases/tag/v2.0.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24738", "GHSA-5jgq-x857-p8xw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4f83bb5-f551-38f5-a85e-d074a5f35f16", "product": {"name": "evmos"}, "product_version": "< 2.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa3c097e-958d-35f4-991d-8ac928e02ae0", "vendor": {"name": "tharsis"}}], "isExploited": false}
