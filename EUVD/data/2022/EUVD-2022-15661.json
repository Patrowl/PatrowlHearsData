The file is written relative to the current 's stylesheet directory, and a .php file extension is added. No validation is performed on the content of the file, triggering an RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell. Further the name parameter is not sanitized, allowing the payload to be uploaded to any directory to which the server has write access.", "datePublished": "2022-04-04T15:35:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T23:32:46", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/abfbba70-5158-4990-98e5-f302361db367"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-0537"], "assigner": "WPScan", "epss": 0.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6962405a-07ec-3c95-97a7-06e98d758ba8", "product": {"name": "MapPress Maps for WordPress"}, "product_version": "2.73.13 <2.73.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3f488e62-8520-30c7-a166-06ce1e222b27", "vendor": {"name": "Unknown"}}], "isExploited": false}
