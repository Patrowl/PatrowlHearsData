Versions of v8n prior to 1.5.1 were found to have an inefficient regular expression complexity in the `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex which could lead to a denial of service attack. In testing of the `lowercase()` function a payload of 'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A' with 32 leading characters took 29443 ms to execute. The same issue happens with uppercase(). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-08-02T20:10:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-22T17:45:31", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/security/advisories/GHSA-xrx9-gj26-5wx9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35923", "https://github.com/imbrn/v8n/commit/92393862156fad190c05ec3f6e2bc73308dcd2f9", "https://github.com/imbrn/v8n", "https://huntr.dev/bounties/2d92f644-593b-43b4-bfd1-c8042ac60609", "https://huntr.dev/bounties/2d92f644-593b-43b4-bfd1-c8042ac60609/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-35923", "GHSA-xrx9-gj26-5wx9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "be22769d-1e0c-3fd0-a996-94f5dc11d4db", "product": {"name": "v8n"}, "product_version": "< 1.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e97d7805-d18c-3b35-9860-3c1db5acc75f", "vendor": {"name": "imbrn"}}], "isExploited": false}
