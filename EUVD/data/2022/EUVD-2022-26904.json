In version 2.11.1 and prior, there are various cases where it is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP packets can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP. A patch is available as a commit in the `master` branch. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2022-01-27T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T16:09:29", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5285", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-m66q-q64c-hv36", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/22af44e68a0c7d190ac1e25075e1382f77e9397a", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/03/msg00035.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202210-37", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/11/msg00021.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00038.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-21722"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f49d03b2-4af4-3b57-90c4-53a5ff702a7a", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f0cb83c-f4f6-33cc-99b4-785f266d1872", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
