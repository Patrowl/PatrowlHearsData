XXEs are a way to permit XML parsers to access storage that exist on external systems. If an unprivileged user is permitted to control the contents of XML files, XXE can be used as an attack vector. Because the XML parser has access to the local filesystem and runs with the permissions of the web server, it can access any file that is readable by the web server and copy it to an external system of the attacker's choosing. This could include files that contain passwords, which could then lead to privilege escalation.", "datePublished": "2018-08-06T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T02:27:40", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2016-8526", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96495", "http://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2017-001.txt", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41482/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-8526"], "assigner": "hpe", "epss": 13.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "11033510-c277-384e-8af3-75c66c6918c1", "product": {"name": "Aruba AirWave"}, "product_version": "all versions up to, but not including, 8.2.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c3732b5-0b3f-3601-bc18-8ef47315fddc", "vendor": {"name": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise"}}], "isExploited": false}
