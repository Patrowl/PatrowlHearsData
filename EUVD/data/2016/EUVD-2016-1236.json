Under certain preconditions, it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non-admin user. As prerequisites, a user must have created an online-connection, validly authenticated and authorized as administrator, and executed telegram simulation. After that, the online-connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation, where a subsequently acting non-admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering-account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON-E Service Program running. Additionally, a valid admin-user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program, having executed telegram simulation; the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence, there is no risk from external attackers.", "datePublished": "2016-12-25T06:50:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T03:07:32", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95296", "https://www.sprecher-automation.com/en/it-security/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10041"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "96ad8e88-4717-3dd5-badf-e45bef0028cb", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3a468a57-5be2-32a4-b954-cf48e12cee95", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
