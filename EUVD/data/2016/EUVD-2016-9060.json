There is an Improper OCSP Validation Vulnerability. OCSP responses have two time values: thisUpdate and nextUpdate. These specify a validity period; however, both values are optional. Crypto-J treats the lack of a nextUpdate as indicating that the OCSP response is valid indefinitely instead of restricting its validity for a brief period surrounding the thisUpdate time. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-4748.", "datePublished": "2017-02-03T07:24:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T02:13:21", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540066/30/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95831", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037732"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-8212"], "assigner": "dell", "epss": 1.14, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eca2d437-379a-3176-9f24-2e75109a6d4f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
