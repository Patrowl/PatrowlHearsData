The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete files owned by the system user. The third-party app can modify the /data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications as they are received on the device. This also allows the /data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The third-party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files to obtain more privileges on the device.", "datePublished": "2017-01-13T09:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T03:14:41", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96854", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10136"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3424365b-2cc0-3384-add7-9ca083c757ad", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "912bc16f-5068-31c2-b117-6fc961d9d08f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
