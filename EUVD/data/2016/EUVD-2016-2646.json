Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker.", "datePublished": "2022-05-17T00:22:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-20T03:31:38", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-1551.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/88219", "http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0132/", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1035705", "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/bulletinapr2016-2952098.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20171004-0002/", "https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-16:16.ntp.asc", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201607-15", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-1551"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-1551"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 0.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1426ad19-bf90-3a25-a48a-a3ac38ffa1f6", "product": {"name": "NTP"}, "product_version": "4.2.8p3"}, {"id": "1caecc54-15a2-3348-bb48-8f757c96019d", "product": {"name": "NTPSec"}, "product_version": "a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92"}, {"id": "7b87dabc-1906-3f16-be75-0ce73a89b916", "product": {"name": "NTPSec"}, "product_version": "3e160db8dc248a0bcb053b56a80167dc742d2b74"}, {"id": "ca175fcb-6f32-3ddd-850d-decfcc4ea25d", "product": {"name": "NTP"}, "product_version": "4.2.8p4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1bb0f2b9-504c-389c-b33e-a6467ca1396f", "vendor": {"name": "NTP Project"}}, {"id": "f7e3072a-790c-34dc-8c2c-8fabb68d7541", "vendor": {"name": "NTPsec Project"}}], "isExploited": false}
