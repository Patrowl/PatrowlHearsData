A possible timing attack could be carried out by modifying a PKCS#12 file that has an integrity MAC for which the password is not known. An attacker could then feed the modified PKCS#12 file to the toolkit and guess the current MAC one byte at a time. This is possible because Crypto-J uses a non-constant-time method to compare the stored MAC with the calculated MAC. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-2601.", "datePublished": "2017-02-03T07:24:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T02:13:21", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/540066/30/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95831", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037732"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-8217"], "assigner": "dell", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3e78b55-a4df-31d0-9ea3-a92f72ae52b8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
