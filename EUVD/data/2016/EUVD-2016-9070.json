This could lead to a denial of service attack or allow certain BIOS variables or settings to be altered (such as boot sequence). The setting or changing of BIOS passwords is not affected by this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2016-11-30T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T02:13:21", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94409", "https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/LEN_8327"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-8222"], "assigner": "lenovo", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f61ae4d0-987a-394a-b475-5e44f4771c2f", "product": {"name": "ThinkPad systems"}, "product_version": "various"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "29ec4413-34b7-3a02-a226-b81698a79014", "vendor": {"name": "Lenovo Group Ltd."}}], "isExploited": false}
