The MSM_MACRO_NAME POST parameter in /swms/ms.cgi was discovered to be vulnerable to OS command injection attacks. It is possible to use the pipe character (|) to inject arbitrary OS commands and retrieve the output in the application's responses. Attackers could execute unauthorized commands, which could then be used to disable the software, or read, write, and modify data for which the attacker does not have permissions to access directly. Since the targeted application is directly executing the commands instead of the attacker, any malicious activities may appear to come from the application or the application's owner (apache user).", "datePublished": "2022-05-17T02:55:58", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-20T03:32:04", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2016-10043", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41179/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10043"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10043"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 37.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ec097af-1b81-343e-98be-dfb7bb93a462", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c00876b-7001-36fa-b770-6bfd4ba6a93b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
