The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read, write, and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third-party app to read, write, and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third-party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so.", "datePublished": "2017-01-13T09:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T03:14:42", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96852", "https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10137"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "142e8f13-cc29-3057-bfd5-ff6a8adf56de", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b7b677ae-88b8-3860-b95a-13558fcd506f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
