The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file, it sets the android:sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user, which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore, any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third-party app, utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver, can perform the following actions: call a phone number, factory reset the device, take pictures of the screen, record the screen in a video, install applications, inject events, obtain the Android log, and others. In addition, the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of http://rebootv5.adsunflower.com/ps/fetch.do where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP, it is vulnerable to a MITM attack.", "datePublished": "2017-01-13T09:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T03:14:41", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.kryptowire.com/adups_security_analysis.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96853", "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/us/politics/china-phones-software-security.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10138"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "46d1708b-18f8-3670-a6c6-91fd9a3a2d75", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "55ccc119-d6bf-3875-b773-1261af14af6d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
