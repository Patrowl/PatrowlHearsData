These vulnerabilities occur in MgrDiagnosticTools.php (/controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php), in the component responsible for performing diagnostic tests with the UNIX wget utility. The application doesn't properly escape the information passed in the 'url' variable before calling the executeCommand class function ($this->dtObj->executeCommand). This function calls exec() with unsanitized user input allowing for remote command injection. The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrDiagnosticTools.php, is accessed by a built-in command answered by the administrative interface. The command that calls to that vulnerable page (passed in the 'section' parameter) is: 'configuration'. Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the 'spiderman' user account.", "datePublished": "2017-01-28T12:38:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T02:50:38", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2016-9554", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95858", "http://pastebin.com/UB8Ye6ZU", "https://community.sophos.com/products/web-appliance/b/blog/posts/release-of-swa-version-4-3-1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-9554"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 11.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ca5464f-8ea7-35c1-be07-f01ca32cb2ea", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a6f799b2-2e7d-32a3-9401-5605de9aa645", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
