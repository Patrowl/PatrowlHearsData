Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially, control characters were not filtered, allowing apparently identical usernames to co-exist in the system, due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing, although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver.", "datePublished": "2022-05-13T01:38:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-20T03:34:57", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/128181", "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/05b1eceb", "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-002/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9471"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-9471"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22fd3334-46d4-367f-a612-4d1502f96961", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
