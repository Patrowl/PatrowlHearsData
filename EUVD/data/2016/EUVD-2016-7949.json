When dnsdist is configured to add EDNS Client Subnet to a query, the response may contain an EDNS0 OPT record that has to be removed before forwarding the response to the initial client. On a 32-bit system, the pointer arithmetic used when parsing the received response to remove that record might trigger an undefined behavior leading to a crash.", "datePublished": "2018-09-11T13:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T01:50:47", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-7069.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-7069", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100509", "https://dnsdist.org/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-for-dnsdist-2017-01.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-7069"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a95e9f4d-cea0-3c76-a21b-1bbd8e56ee0d", "product": {"name": "dnsdist"}, "product_version": "1.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff0f260f-2fea-3bd1-913a-6f16aab89cbe", "vendor": {"name": "Open-Xchange"}}], "isExploited": false}
