The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an HTTP packet stream. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet stream to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.", "datePublished": "2016-10-27T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T01:29:20", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161019-fpsnort", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037061", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93787"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-6439"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c87de03f-56de-3051-b508-ef277ae10aaa", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
