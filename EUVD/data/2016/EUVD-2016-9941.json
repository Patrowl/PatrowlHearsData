The login page of Revive Adserver is vulnerable to password-guessing attacks. An account lockdown feature was considered, but rejected to avoid introducing service disruptions to regular users during such attacks. A random delay has instead been introduced as a countermeasure in case of password failures, along with a system to discourage parallel brute forcing. These systems will effectively allow the valid users to log in to the adserver, even while an attack is in progress.", "datePublished": "2022-05-13T01:38:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-20T03:34:57", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/96115", "https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2016-001/", "https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/commit/847941390f5b3310d51b07c92ec91cc1f4cc82c9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9124"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-9124"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.77, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9d65eed5-32b8-3404-a01a-bb51443b3d07", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
