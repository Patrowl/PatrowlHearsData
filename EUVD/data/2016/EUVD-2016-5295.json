The vulnerability occurs when processing data for a formula used to render a chart via the HncChartPlugin.hplg library. Due to a lack of bounds-checking when incrementing an index that is used for writing into a buffer for formulae, the application can be made to write pointer data outside its bounds which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.", "datePublished": "2022-05-17T03:05:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-20T03:30:49", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.talosintelligence.com/reports/TALOS-2016-0150/", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92327", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-4295"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-4295"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "789d7717-1b34-3d10-aa16-0292460b2ef7", "product": {"name": "Hancom Office"}, "product_version": "2014 VP Trial HCell.exe Product version: 9.1.0.2176, HCellApp.dll Product version: 9.1.0.2176 HCellBook.dll Product version: 9.1.0.2176"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dfee0442-414a-337e-9553-d3df7b4699a2", "vendor": {"name": "Hancom"}}], "isExploited": false}
