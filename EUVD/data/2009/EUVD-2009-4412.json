NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the third-party product, not IIS, because the third-party product should be applying its extension restrictions to the portion of the filename before the colon.", "datePublished": "2009-12-29T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T07:01:20", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["http://securitytracker.com/id?1023387", "http://soroush.secproject.com/downloadable/iis-semicolon-report.pdf", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/55308"], "aliases": ["CVE-2009-4445"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 14.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19559b98-df64-37a3-aaa4-fa601dd71ede", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3b68366c-516c-33a4-a979-1a3c62c119ba", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
