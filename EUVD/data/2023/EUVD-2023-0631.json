All React applications built with react-admin and using the `<RichTextField>` are affected. `<RichTextField>` outputs the field value using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the data isn't sanitized server-side, this opens a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify` to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Users who already sanitize HTML data server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround, users may replace the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand.\n", "datePublished": "2023-02-13T20:49:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:25:19", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/security/advisories/GHSA-5jcr-82fh-339v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25572", "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/pull/8644", "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/pull/8645", "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin", "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/releases/tag/v3.19.12", "https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/releases/tag/v4.7.6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25572", "GHSA-5jcr-82fh-339v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4e743ea9-7f82-392e-926e-281b012313f2", "product": {"name": "react-admin"}, "product_version": "< 3.19.12"}, {"id": "6496a639-d39a-3dda-8fc4-4c8eccf1a886", "product": {"name": "react-admin"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.7.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f118b465-ebcb-3bac-a85b-a4ddb028afa6", "vendor": {"name": "marmelab"}}], "isExploited": false}
