Prior to version 5.10.0 of the `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module, corresponding to ReportPortal version 23.2, the ReportPortal database becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path field is exceeded the allowable `ltree` field type indexing limit (path length>=120, approximately recursive nesting of the nested steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't helped. The problem was fixed in `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where the maximum number of nested elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is available. After deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx), the database becomes stable and ReportPortal works properly.", "datePublished": "2023-10-09T13:13:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-19T13:57:44", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/security/advisories/GHSA-mj24-gpw7-23m9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25822", "https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal", "https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/releases/tag/v23.2", "https://reportportal.io/docs/releases/Version23.2", "https://reportportal.io/docs/releases/Version23.2/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25822", "GHSA-mj24-gpw7-23m9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "04131f19-5612-3f98-b363-f32d362fc4fa", "product": {"name": "reportportal"}, "product_version": "< 5.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "18055ef9-0fe5-3c45-936c-8cbafba84762", "vendor": {"name": "reportportal"}}], "isExploited": false}
