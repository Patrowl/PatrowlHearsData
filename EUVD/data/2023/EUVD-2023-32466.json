Nextcloud Server 24.0.0 until 24.0.6 and 25.0.0 until 25.0.4, as well as Nextcloud Enterprise Server 23.0.0 until 23.0.11, 24.0.0 until 24.0.6, and 25.0.0 until 25.0.4, have an information disclosure vulnerability. A user was able to get the full data directory path of the Nextcloud server from an API endpoint. By itself this information is not problematic as it can also be guessed for most common setups, but it could speed up other unknown attacks in the future if the information is known. Nextcloud Server 24.0.6 and 25.0.4 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server 23.0.11, 24.0.6, and 25.0.4 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-04-03T16:19:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-11T14:37:26", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-5w64-6c42-rgcv", "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/33883", "https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36094", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1690510"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28834"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b3b592ca-5502-3ead-ae5b-8ba515b6c68c", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "23.0.0, < 23.0.14"}, {"id": "ceae3e38-443b-328c-ab1f-7d1a27aee332", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "25.0.0, < 25.0.4"}, {"id": "ec714f06-0ab5-3abc-a83e-cc4005ee2764", "product": {"name": "security-advisories"}, "product_version": "24.0.0, < 24.0.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6fc89bd7-75d6-3f0b-9772-8c883d0acc1b", "vendor": {"name": "nextcloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
