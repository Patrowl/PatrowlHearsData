This makes it easier to attempt denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch. As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on their email server when possible.", "datePublished": "2023-02-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:18:36", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-7j9h-3jxf-3vrf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25171", "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/761305d04f5910ba14cc04d1255a8f1afdbb87f3", "https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi", "https://huntr.dev/bounties/3b712cb6-3fa3-4f71-8562-7a7016c6262e", "https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120", "https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/02/15/kiwi-tcms-120/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25171", "GHSA-7j9h-3jxf-3vrf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1831df2e-60bc-3bbc-81fd-18fd10adb709", "product": {"name": "Kiwi"}, "product_version": "12.0 <12.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1feaa729-f145-3554-875f-19a098ebdfbd", "vendor": {"name": "kiwitcms"}}], "isExploited": false}
