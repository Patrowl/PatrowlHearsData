It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \\ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.", "datePublished": "2024-01-10T21:31:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-03T15:31:08", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/", "https://www.kyoceradocumentsolutions.us/en/about-us/pr-and-award-certifications/press/kyocera-device-manager-cve-2023-50196-vulnerability-solution-update.html", "https://www.trustwave.com/hubfs/Web/Library/Advisories_txt/TWSL2024-001_kyocera-v2.txt", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50916"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-50916"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5f43bdec-8b57-3f3f-8f84-657ea7136240", "product": {"name": "n/a"}}, {"id": "ecac069c-7892-309b-b8a7-44a1abe01e36", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5f43bdec-8b57-3f3f-8f84-657ea7136240", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
