A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting Iframe Dialog and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions: using one of the affected packages on a web page with missing proper Content Security Policy configuration; initializing the editor on an element and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy mechanism.\n\nA fix is available in CKEditor4 version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered a breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option. Those who choose to enable either of the more permissive options or who cannot upgrade to a patched version should properly configure Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues that may arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page.", "datePublished": "2023-03-22T20:55:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:48:42", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-xwqv-cv9g", "https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/embed", "https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/iframe", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GWKG2VCPJNETVCDTXU4X6FQ2PO6XCNGN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VCYKD3JZWWA3ESOZG4PHJJEXT4EYIUIQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L4ODGOW6PYVOXHQSMWJBOCE6DXWAI33W/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28439"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ebe9289-dd7e-3434-b76f-6821c37b283e", "product": {"name": "ckeditor4"}, "product_version": "< 4.21.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cd77bf58-0c21-31e9-96f8-643f80f8e2a7", "vendor": {"name": "ckeditor"}}], "isExploited": false}
