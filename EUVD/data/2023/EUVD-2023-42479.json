Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.", "datePublished": "2023-08-04T18:10:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-08T17:39:16", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/KnowageLabs/Knowage-Server/security/advisories/GHSA-7mjh-73q3-c3fc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-38702"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8b41f330-e22a-360f-a460-5eb478554f6f", "product": {"name": "Knowage-Server"}, "product_version": "6.0.0, < 8.1.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ba8f4a8-f695-32c8-a9a6-6aca3d4db94f", "vendor": {"name": "KnowageLabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
