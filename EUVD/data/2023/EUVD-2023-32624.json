The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\\etc\\connectrc`. Since `C:\\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively, watch out for malicious `<drive>:\\etc\\connectrc` files on multi-user machines.", "datePublished": "2023-04-25T20:40:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-03T18:07:25", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm", "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29011"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a170fac6-0577-371f-8b75-264276dc5844", "product": {"name": "Git"}, "product_version": "< 2.40.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "681678f5-e872-35c1-8c19-8e4a2e660451", "vendor": {"name": "git-for-windows"}}], "isExploited": false}
