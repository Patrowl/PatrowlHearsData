As\u00a0of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all\u00a0mappings must now be via explicit configuration.\u00a0Only mod_jk is affected\u00a0by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.\n\nHistory\n2023-09-13 Original advisory\n\n2023-09-28 Updated summary\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-09-13T09:30:05", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T17:21:30", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread/rd1r26w7271jyqgzr4492tooyt583d8b", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/13/2", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/09/msg00027.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41081"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aec2760c-4baa-33fa-82a2-ea89b081fc6f", "product": {"name": "Apache Tomcat Connectors"}, "product_version": "1.2.0 \u22641.2.48"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3926356c-74a2-3c63-9b0e-a7be954096ee", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
