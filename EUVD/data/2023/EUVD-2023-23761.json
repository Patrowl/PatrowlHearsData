When a client connects to a server using TLS, the server presents a certificate. This certificate links a public key to the identity of the service and is signed by a Certification Authority (CA), allowing the client to validate that the remote service can be trusted\u00a0and is not malicious. If the client does not validate the parameters of the certificate, then attackers could be able to spoof the identity of the service. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using faking the identity of a RTU500 device and intercepting the messages initiated via the RTU500 Scripting interface.", "datePublished": "2023-12-19T14:22:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T05:49:11", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://publisher.hitachienergy.com/preview?DocumentId=8DBD000152&languageCode=en&Preview=true"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1514"], "assigner": "Hitachi Energy", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58a0844c-229e-3714-bf64-b1fe10f585fc", "product": {"name": "RTU500 Scripting Interface"}, "product_version": "1.0.1.30"}, {"id": "6faacd9d-f957-34f0-bd35-cc3df228ffb9", "product": {"name": "RTU500 Scripting Interface"}, "product_version": "1.1.1"}, {"id": "b5bb2376-0c83-32b6-9025-106c4f9f88ce", "product": {"name": "RTU500 Scripting Interface"}, "product_version": "1.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2cba83f-4fc5-3e1a-bd11-3e68ee42ea87", "vendor": {"name": "Hitachi Energy"}}], "isExploited": false}
