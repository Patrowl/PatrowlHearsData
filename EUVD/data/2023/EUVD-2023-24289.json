This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive data on the underlying database.", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T15:57:49", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ssm-sql-X9MmjSYh"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20110"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "51da5ca0-f0a0-3020-8b2e-41b2c6497bcb", "product": {"name": "Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0764e59e-899c-3819-a4f3-f47a32b51b17", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
