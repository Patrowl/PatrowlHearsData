The \"restricted\" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1, only escaped `<script>` and `<style>`-tags but neither attributes that can be used to inject scripts nor other dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`. As a consequence, any code relying on this \"restricted\" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (\"cross-site scripting\"/XSS). When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6 RC1 with the introduction of a filter with allowed HTML elements and attributes that is enabled in restricted mode. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.", "datePublished": "2023-04-15T14:24:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:00:16", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-m3jr-cvhj-f35j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29201", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/4a185e0594d90cd4916d60aa60bb4333dc5623b2", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/b11eae9d82cb53f32962056b5faa73f3720c6182", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1680", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2426", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9118"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29201", "GHSA-m3jr-cvhj-f35j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.97, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66564a62-3862-3de8-960e-12717ab87284", "product": {"name": "xwiki-commons"}, "product_version": "4.2-milestone-1, < 14.6-rc-1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7f2e1934-132a-344a-809a-4972c117c384", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
