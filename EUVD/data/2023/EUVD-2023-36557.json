Versions prior to 1.1.9 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser` privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue has been patched as of version 1.1.9.", "datePublished": "2023-05-12T18:46:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:50:30", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/security/advisories/GHSA-7r4w-fw4h-67gp", "https://github.com/aiven/aiven-extras/commit/8682ae01bec0791708bf25791786d776e2fb0250", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230616-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32305"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.85, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "33ea0891-0f34-3d3b-b06d-ae059b42f56f", "product": {"name": "aiven-extras"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f8849c3-0813-3070-9c38-bd8a8991ff6d", "vendor": {"name": "aiven"}}], "isExploited": false}
