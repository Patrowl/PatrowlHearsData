Affected versions are subject to improper signature counter value handling. A flaw was found in webauthn4j-spring-security-core. When an authneticator returns an incremented signature counter value during authentication, webauthn4j-spring-security-core does not properly persist the value, which means cloned authenticator detection does not work. An attacker who cloned valid authenticator in some way can use the cloned authenticator without being detected. This issue has been addressed in version `0.9.1.RELEASE`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "datePublished": "2023-10-16T18:20:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-13T19:36:56", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security/security/advisories/GHSA-v9hx-v6vf-g36j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45669", "https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security/commit/129700d74d83f9b9a82bf88ebc63707e3cb0a725", "https://github.com/webauthn4j/webauthn4j-spring-security", "https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-webauthn-2-20210408/#sctn-sign-counter"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45669", "GHSA-v9hx-v6vf-g36j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6aa3280d-bc23-39cb-92c1-2e2b508b4b80", "product": {"name": "webauthn4j-spring-security"}, "product_version": "< 0.9.1.RELEASE"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23394dad-901c-36c4-ab67-0f6b2aeeacac", "vendor": {"name": "webauthn4j"}}], "isExploited": false}
