The content is then only accessible to website visitors after entering the password. In WordPress, users with the \"Author\" role can create stories, but don't have the ability to edit password protected stories. The vulnerability allowed users with said role to bypass this permission check when trying to duplicate the protected story in the plugin's own dashboard, giving them access to the seemingly protected content. We recommend upgrading to version 1.32 or beyond commit\u00a0 ad49781c2a35c5c92ef704d4b621ab4e5cb77d68 https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/commit/ad49781c2a35c5c92ef704d4b621ab4e5cb77d68 \n", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T16:28:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-28T20:04:13", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/commit/ad49781c2a35c5c92ef704d4b621ab4e5cb77d68", "https://github.com/GoogleForCreators/web-stories-wp/releases/tag/v1.32.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1979"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "68ae8d67-5af8-349e-b898-6da3e94d1dcc", "product": {"name": "Web Stories for WordPress"}, "product_version": "0 <1.32"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "19d54a9f-2699-333d-982b-61d68b53a74c", "vendor": {"name": "Google"}}], "isExploited": false}
