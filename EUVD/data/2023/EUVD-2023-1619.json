Prior to version 5.46.1, due to a lack of validation when filtering on the public API endpoints, it is possible to reveal private fields via a brute force attack.\n\nGhost(Pro) has already been patched. Maintainers can find no evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version below v5.46.1. v5.46.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, add a block for requests to `/ghost/api/content/*` where the `filter` query parameter contains `password` or `email`.", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T20:56:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-29T14:53:24", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/security/advisories/GHSA-r97q-ghch-82j9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31133", "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/commit/b3caf16005289cc9909488391b4a26f3f4a66a90", "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost", "https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases/tag/v5.46.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31133", "GHSA-r97q-ghch-82j9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 17.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d0f7b438-b077-3694-b230-fd5c1c5f7d20", "product": {"name": "Ghost"}, "product_version": "< 5.46.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1727cee8-f121-3978-9270-1c684244f462", "vendor": {"name": "TryGhost"}}], "isExploited": false}
