When logging in as a user with SSO enabled an attacker may authenticate as an other user. Any user account which does not have a second factor enabled could be compromised. This issue has been addressed in commit `8173f6512a` and in releases starting with version 0.7.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should require their users to use a second factor in authentication.", "datePublished": "2023-07-14T21:02:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T17:41:24", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/security/advisories/GHSA-868r-97g5-r9g4", "https://github.com/warp-tech/warpgate/commit/8173f6512ab6183fa5edc5c9a5f3760b8979271e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37268"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "28a432b9-0f51-3a32-8008-ff14328686c7", "product": {"name": "warpgate"}, "product_version": "< 0.7.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "afb89941-ede1-3700-ad18-9ae1d6fd3219", "vendor": {"name": "warp-tech"}}], "isExploited": false}
