The MQTT server also leaks the location, video and diagnostic data from each connected device. An attacker who knows the IP address of the server is able to connect and perform the following operations:\n\n  *  Get location data of the vehicle the device is connected to\n  *  Send CAN bus messages via the ECU module ( https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/ecu-1 https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/ecu-1 )\n\n  *  Immobilize the vehicle via the safe-immobilizer module ( https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#safe-immobilization https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#safe-immobilization )\n\n  *  Get live video through the connected video camera\n\n  *  Send audio messages to the driver ( https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#apx-tts https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#apx-tts )\n\n\n\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-11-21T21:49:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-17T18:01:16", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.digitalcomtech.com/product/syrus-4g-iot-telematics-gateway/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6248"], "assigner": "ASRG", "epss": 1.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6e4864ad-23e9-3b62-a9cc-3315b058d1c0", "product": {"name": "Syrus4 IoT Telematics Gateway"}, "product_version": "apex-23.43.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4bea82c9-5a4f-3696-8202-cc31b0b20cc0", "vendor": {"name": "Digital Communications Technologies"}}], "isExploited": false}
