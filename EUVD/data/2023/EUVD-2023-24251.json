This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of large fragmented tunnel protocol packets. One example of a tunnel protocol is Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted fragmented packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-03-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:32:38", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-gre-crash-p6nE5Sq5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20072"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "70cdb2c4-81d4-3981-9ec5-cb89a42ed6a4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3734c6e-f56a-33ae-b6f6-9d5eaa085a49", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
