If it's not the same it means that\nit's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is\naborted because the local entry contains stale data.\n\nReproducer:\nI originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work\non the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test\nmachine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so\nwhatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do\nthe trick.\n\nIn order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of\navailable memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1\n--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens\nof minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging\n/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20\nand 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It's crucial to set\n`--vm-stride` to something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won't\nrealize that memory has been corrupted because all pages would have the\nsame data.", "datePublished": "2025-09-15T15:31:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-02T03:31:33", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2cab13f500a6333bd2b853783ac76be9e4956f8a", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba700ea13bf0105a4773c654f7d3bef8adb64ab2", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04fc7816089c5a32c29a04ec94b998e219dfb946", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53178"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-53178"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2f4cec95-ed9e-334d-ae7f-92e9b6fbb7bc", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <ba700ea13bf0105a4773c654f7d3bef8adb64ab2"}, {"id": "8b4d5bf0-17bd-3036-ba77-e08f2c60dcfe", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <2cab13f500a6333bd2b853783ac76be9e4956f8a"}, {"id": "8e44db4c-a337-388c-bf18-47dfca1fb7b5", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "98d43f48-3b0e-386e-9903-d268746516ad", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.4"}, {"id": "9c67100a-91d4-386f-b6bc-fdda33cd50ed", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <04fc7816089c5a32c29a04ec94b998e219dfb946"}, {"id": "ad0446af-05d3-3a4d-983e-b93b3b6b541a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.3.4"}, {"id": "adcdebef-2c05-3ec8-9854-dbbe3454bb5c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "2b2811178e85553405b86e3fe78357b9b95889ce <04fc7816089c5a32c29a04ec94b998e219dfb946"}, {"id": "af0f8285-9c26-3c31-a8b4-fe6ba2703ed4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "3.11"}, {"id": "cbc49b71-82c9-3581-b48d-49f077497202", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "2b2811178e85553405b86e3fe78357b9b95889ce <2cab13f500a6333bd2b853783ac76be9e4956f8a"}, {"id": "cde88812-330d-38ee-90c6-cd8a168dba9c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1.30"}, {"id": "e44c450d-951b-3173-a292-df2f6f021d74", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "2b2811178e85553405b86e3fe78357b9b95889ce <ba700ea13bf0105a4773c654f7d3bef8adb64ab2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16fcf56b-7c42-3dfe-a014-dba9ae36e141", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
