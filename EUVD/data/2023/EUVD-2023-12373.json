Even though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd components, to enable periodic health checks from kubelet, it was necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy, hence this port might be considered as still vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain sensitive data (only metrics data), therefore the potential impact related to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track the permanent fix in the etcd component.", "datePublished": "2023-01-17T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T05:10:55", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:7399", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0069", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0241", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0574", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2161287"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0296"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3783c140-5c53-3297-8150-96f795a51db9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
