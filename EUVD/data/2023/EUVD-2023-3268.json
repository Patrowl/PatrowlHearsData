The library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`. There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow. fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious user can construct a URL known  to not fetch successfully, then set the retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch options.", "datePublished": "2023-12-08T23:41:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T22:01:26", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party/security/advisories/GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49800", "https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-api-party"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49800", "GHSA-q6hx-3m4p-749h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ddab4e2f-91a6-3f27-b89f-0003404df679", "product": {"name": "nuxt-api-party"}, "product_version": "< 0.22.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5866188d-7661-3ca2-976a-395554bb0a86", "vendor": {"name": "johannschopplich"}}], "isExploited": false}
