{"id": "EUVD-2023-2960", "enisaUuid": "be9383fc-c02f-33f1-ae45-c7a94ce289fb", "description": "LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and operating systems. In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices on librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been included in release version 23.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-17T21:12:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T21:23:39", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/librenms/librenms/security/advisories/GHSA-fpq5-4vwm-78x4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48294", "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/commit/489978a923ed52aa243d3419889ca298a8a6a7cf", "https://github.com/librenms/librenms", "https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/fa93034edd40c130c2ff00667ca2498d84be6e69/html/graph.php#L19C1-L25C2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48294", "GHSA-fpq5-4vwm-78x4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03ca699e-0fb1-32ab-9d47-b1250a4a595e", "product": {"name": "librenms"}, "product_version": "< 23.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c2889e07-f389-3036-9bda-cbe6cb6f0f77", "vendor": {"name": "librenms"}}], "isExploited": false}
