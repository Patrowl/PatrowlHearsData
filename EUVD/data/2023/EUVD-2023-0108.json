In all current versions of Label Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows users to insecurely set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can construct a filter chain to filter tasks based on sensitive fields for all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields character by character. In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded secret key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak account password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `f931d9d129` which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-13T11:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T04:22:53", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-6hjj-gq77-j4qw", "https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-6hjj-gq77-j4qw", "https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio/commit/f931d9d129002f54a495995774ce7384174cef5c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47117", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/label-studio/PYSEC-2023-275.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-47117", "GHSA-6hjj-gq77-j4qw", "PYSEC-2023-275"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 65.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e36563a1-a025-35aa-ae8c-11c248aac6b8", "product": {"name": "label-studio"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.2post0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "84608674-5eea-34ab-9d5f-db06433105eb", "vendor": {"name": "HumanSignal"}}], "isExploited": false}
