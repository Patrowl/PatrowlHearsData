A discovered oEmbed or image URL can bypass the `url_preview_url_blacklist` setting potentially allowing server side request forgery or bypassing network policies. Impact is limited to IP addresses allowed by the `url_preview_ip_range_blacklist` setting (by default this only allows public IPs) and by the limited information returned to the client: 1. For discovered oEmbed URLs, any non-JSON response or a JSON response which includes non-oEmbed information is discarded. 2. For discovered image URLs, any non-image response is discarded. Systems which have URL preview disabled (via the `url_preview_enabled` setting) or have not configured a `url_preview_url_blacklist` are not affected. This issue has been addressed in version 1.85.0. Users are advised to upgrade. User unable to upgrade may also disable URL previews.", "datePublished": "2023-06-06T18:24:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:54:58", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-98px-6486-j7qc", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-98px-6486-j7qc", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/15601", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32683", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.85.0", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/matrix-synapse/PYSEC-2023-85.yaml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X6DH5A5YEB5LRIPP32OUW25FCGZFCZU2", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/X6DH5A5YEB5LRIPP32OUW25FCGZFCZU2/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32683", "GHSA-98px-6486-j7qc", "PYSEC-2023-85"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6d460d14-23f6-3e5c-89ed-a6bdbed0edbc", "product": {"name": "synapse"}, "product_version": "< 1.85.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2d602c3-934a-3760-9958-58c0ccb7e56b", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
