{"id": "EUVD-2023-0532", "enisaUuid": "2ea3e092-f1e5-3e40-af5d-58f440e3f913", "description": "Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. Versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 and prior to 2.3.13, 2.4.19, 2.5.6, and 2.6.0-rc-3  are vulnerable to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens. OIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD. If Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD. This bug also increases the impact of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.0-rc3, 2.5.6, 2.4.19, and 2.3.13. There are no workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-01-25T18:25:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:13:48", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-q9hr-j4rf-8fjc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22482", "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0466", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0467", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0468"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22482", "GHSA-q9hr-j4rf-8fjc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "289e4995-b706-32f8-ac3e-72c06f0ef7eb", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "1.8.2, < 2.3.13"}, {"id": "59cafde9-6c9d-3ec1-9ef6-323c955a3fb6", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.6.0-rc1, < 2.6.0-rc3"}, {"id": "a30f0131-2e48-3276-bbe3-4227e7727c5c", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.5.0-rc1, < 2.5.6"}, {"id": "b4a053a7-d908-3cbf-86b3-edb6d50ac7ee", "product": {"name": "argo-cd"}, "product_version": "2.4.0-rc1, < 2.4.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b10da2b3-dbae-3e34-b3cb-91fa9d4d8a63", "vendor": {"name": "argoproj"}}], "isExploited": false}
