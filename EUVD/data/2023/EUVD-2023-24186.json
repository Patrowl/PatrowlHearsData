The attacker must have valid administrator credentials. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the web-based management process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2023-01-19T01:40:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:57:35", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sb-rv-rcedos-7HjP74jD"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20007"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "258afa2f-bb38-3bfd-8c23-195b4837c96f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.22"}, {"id": "2865e3c1-96c8-327c-a030-3a8c1acc0d49", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.20"}, {"id": "35ff7b9f-2a63-3e6f-83a6-c3ce07a09bef", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.15"}, {"id": "36fcff26-67af-3e7a-b079-2562a3110972", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.01.17"}, {"id": "3ee99cd6-f92a-352e-9d52-3f6160f3d16d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.01.18"}, {"id": "464271c5-1715-33bc-ba09-e88039b018e0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.02.16"}, {"id": "4c9eac1c-ef52-305c-9499-ab24f3030bc1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.00.33"}, {"id": "5393405c-ff12-395b-81bd-01fb1dc52d4b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.18"}, {"id": "7c9b017a-ceaf-316b-9776-d5f5d70b0295", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.17"}, {"id": "836aeb5b-6a8f-3af5-a8fd-7832aadd0d61", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.21"}, {"id": "84fa8f84-c5b5-352a-8029-fffba471825a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.19"}, {"id": "882e57a8-6630-37a5-9ff2-471673fc3b68", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.01.16"}, {"id": "9434f87f-bee4-30b4-b361-e9eaa95e42c5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.00.29"}, {"id": "c288d757-0eba-32a0-aedf-0dfeb272d4c4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.16"}, {"id": "dbea9297-e1f5-3dbb-b90f-1249e861502a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.28"}, {"id": "e8e057cf-aec6-30a5-ad65-fcf6a0e67d4f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.24"}, {"id": "faaede4a-3213-3f5d-8f47-378cbff8892f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.26"}, {"id": "ff474404-1737-3ef4-884b-4b6b3fb18f7c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.03.27"}, {"id": "ffe6ee5b-4c8d-3f15-bb8b-ab57c1ef04ea", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "1.0.01.20"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f91a886-b227-365a-adac-92adf9a00c5b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
