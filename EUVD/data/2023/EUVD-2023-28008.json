Versions prior to 3.6.3 are missing sanitisation on qml labels which are used for basic HTML elements such as `strong`, `em` and `head` lines in the UI of the desktop client. The lack of sanitisation may allow for javascript injection. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop Client is upgraded to 3.6.3.
