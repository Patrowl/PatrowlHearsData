This was\nleading to a BUG_ON() being hit [1] when we missed a PA that could satisfy\nour request and ultimately tried to create a new PA that would overlap\nwith the missed one.\n\nTo makes sure we handle that case while still keeping the performance of\nthe rbtree, we make use of the fact that the only pa that could possibly\noverlap the original goal start is the one that satisfies the below\nconditions:\n\n  1. It must have it's logical start immediately to the left of\n  (ie less than) original logical start.\n\n  2. It must not be deleted\n\nTo find this pa we use the following traversal method:\n\n1. Descend into the rbtree normally to find the immediate neighboring\nPA. Here we keep descending irrespective of if the PA is deleted or if\nit overlaps with our request etc. The goal is to find an immediately\nadjacent PA.\n\n2. If the found PA is on right of original goal, use rb_prev() to find\nthe left adjacent PA.\n\n3. Check if this PA is deleted and keep moving left with rb_prev() until\na non deleted PA is found.\n\n4. This is the PA we are looking for. Now we can check if it can satisfy\nthe original request and proceed accordingly.\n\nThis approach also takes care of having deleted PAs in the tree.\n\n(While we are at it, also fix a possible overflow bug in calculating the\nend of a PA)\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-ext4/CA+G9fYv2FRpLqBZf34ZinR8bU2_ZRAUOjKAD3+tKRFaEQHtt8Q@mail.gmail.com/", "datePublished": "2025-12-09T03:31:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-09T03:31:11", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/339fee69a1daa71d6f97e47a867e2c32419a2406", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9d3de7ee192a6a253f475197fe4d2e2af10a731f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53813"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-53813"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f17b5df-43f9-3a38-aa02-c2e3e3440f90", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.5"}, {"id": "80b75da1-4d4c-3ece-9732-5ffea2a864ea", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.4.8"}, {"id": "8f12b98c-060d-34c7-8719-211badeffb8e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "3872778664e36528caf8b27f355e75482f6d562d <339fee69a1daa71d6f97e47a867e2c32419a2406"}, {"id": "98d9ace1-2c0c-365f-941f-ca804cb91753", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.4"}, {"id": "aa0755b5-569f-39e0-9a63-60ba35a3dda8", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "3872778664e36528caf8b27f355e75482f6d562d <9d3de7ee192a6a253f475197fe4d2e2af10a731f"}, {"id": "bd2a11cf-434c-3b3a-823e-3a7959f9eda2", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b78f1d1-f27f-35d9-a8b2-762f54b546d9", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
