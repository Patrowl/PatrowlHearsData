When certain request URLs like \u201c@127.0.0.1:1234\" are used in WireMock Studio configuration fields, the request might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock\u2019s instance. There are 3 identified potential attack vectors: via \u201cTestRequester\u201d functionality, webhooks and the proxy mode. As we can control HTTP Method, HTTP Headers, HTTP Data, it allows sending requests with the default level of credentials for the WireMock instance. The vendor has discontinued the affected Wiremock studio product and there will be no fix. Users are advised to find alternatives.", "datePublished": "2023-09-06T20:40:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-26T15:11:42", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-676j-xrv3-73vc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39967"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb905c01-f97d-3f3b-a243-9e6392116436", "product": {"name": "wiremock"}, "product_version": "All versions"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5d2bb9c0-9fe4-313a-b320-9ebe69215be8", "vendor": {"name": "wiremock"}}], "isExploited": false}
