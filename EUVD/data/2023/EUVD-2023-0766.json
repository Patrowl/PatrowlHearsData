The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render a chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1. Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not want passed to DNS servers.", "datePublished": "2023-02-08T19:07:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:18:35", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25165", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/293b50c65d4d56187cd4e2f390f0ada46b4c4737", "https://github.com/helm/helm/commit/5abcf74227bfe8e5a3dbf105fe62e7b12deb58d2", "https://github.com/helm/helm", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1547", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25165.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25165", "GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9bd4c7b6-f132-3294-ae6d-9931309e4a08", "product": {"name": "helm"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dcc58c40-8bc4-345b-868b-47c4afc08b8f", "vendor": {"name": "helm"}}], "isExploited": false}
