This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when the victim visits a a page containing the shortcode when the submission id is present in the query string. Note that getting the JavaScript to execute requires user interaction as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored in the site database. Additionally this requires successful payment, increasing the complexity.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T05:33:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-23T13:18:21", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/89a98053-33c7-4e75-87a1-0f483a990641?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/metform/trunk/base/shortcode.php?rev=2845078"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0710"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f773c641-411a-395d-9d84-e42e7b0cd543", "product": {"name": "Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder \u2013 Flexible and Design-Friendly Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7e2fe518-b320-3be5-a48a-535eb90e80db", "vendor": {"name": "xpeedstudio"}}], "isExploited": false}
