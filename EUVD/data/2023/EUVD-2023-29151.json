Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.", "datePublished": "2023-06-16T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-12T20:38:02", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:H/AV:L/A:H/C:H/I:H/PR:H/S:U/UI:R", "references": ["https://Nokia.com", "https://www.nokia.com/about-us/security-and-privacy/product-security-advisory/cve-2023-25187/", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173055/Nokia-ASIKA-7.13.52-Private-Key-Disclosure.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25187"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "63adf5a4-d2f6-32ae-a3d6-152f835fb0cf", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "670c3a08-8499-307f-bc84-c15b7899f488", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
