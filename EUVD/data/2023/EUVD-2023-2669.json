{"id": "EUVD-2023-2669", "enisaUuid": "091ffe02-08d7-3abc-becc-de4f48860ad1", "description": "Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using its `useBuiltIns` option; and any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2` and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.", "datePublished": "2023-10-12T16:17:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:13:48", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45133", "https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16033", "https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/b13376b346946e3f62fc0848c1d2a23223314c82", "https://babeljs.io/blog/2023/10/16/cve-2023-45133", "https://github.com/babel/babel", "https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.23.2", "https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v8.0.0-alpha.4", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00026.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5528"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45133", "GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "426d1bc9-bee1-3739-aca3-c0b704ba35f4", "product": {"name": "Babel"}, "product_version": "< 7.23.2"}, {"id": "667f1523-47a8-349b-81d8-bcfa43f0a792", "product": {"name": "Babel"}, "product_version": "8.0.0-alpha.0, < 8.0.0-alpha.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b95d32f8-0b6c-3f4c-b86e-bb0127646362", "vendor": {"name": "babel"}}], "isExploited": false}
