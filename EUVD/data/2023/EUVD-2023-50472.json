Prior to version 1.5.10.15, due to a lack of request sanitization in the logs, a malicious request containing XSS would be stored in a log file. When an administrator of the FOG server logged in and viewed the logs, they would be parsed as HTML and displayed accordingly. Version 1.5.10.15 contains a patch. As a workaround, view logs from an external text editor rather than the dashboard.", "datePublished": "2023-10-31T14:25:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T17:47:51", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/security/advisories/GHSA-cvf7-7mvq-5694", "https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/2e2421f19620669b9930f72fb73a8dbc5efe4980"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46235"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "33d2e75a-f4f4-3465-962b-1b50f4dfa3d9", "product": {"name": "fogproject"}, "product_version": "< 1.5.10.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f402c958-0cfc-3372-9404-37a22f71f90e", "vendor": {"name": "FOGProject"}}], "isExploited": false}
