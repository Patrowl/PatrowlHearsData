It was believed that the\nmitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled.\n\nHowever, the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left\ninterrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one\nconditionally on whether XPTI was active.\n\nAs BTC/SRSO and Meltdown affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations\nare not active together by default.  Therefore, there is a race\ncondition whereby a malicious PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections\nand launch a BTC/SRSO attack against Xen.\n", "datePublished": "2024-01-05T16:34:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:25:42", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-446.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46836", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-446.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46836"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5483813d-24f2-352a-800b-281a1b6b805a", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5483813d-24f2-352a-800b-281a1b6b805a", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
