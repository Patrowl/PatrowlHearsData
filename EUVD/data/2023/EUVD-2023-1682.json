Affected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting malicious content. `@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes` option to the link plugin, defaulting to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. URLs using a scheme that isn't in this list will not be rendered to the DOM. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade are advised to override the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any anchor elements.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T17:04:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-06T18:13:51", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/udecode/plate/security/advisories/GHSA-4882-hxpr-hrvm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34245", "https://github.com/udecode/plate/pull/2240", "https://github.com/udecode/plate/commit/93dd5712854660874900ae12e4d8e6ff28089eb7", "https://github.com/udecode/plate"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34245", "GHSA-4882-hxpr-hrvm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5f240fe-8125-37e8-a5de-c5e7f62fc572", "product": {"name": "plate"}, "product_version": "< 20.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f51d4471-1856-3e56-8b96-a038edf500ac", "vendor": {"name": "udecode"}}], "isExploited": false}
