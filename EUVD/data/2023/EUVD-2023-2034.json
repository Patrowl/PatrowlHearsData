Prior to version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi, not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or modify their own content types without realizing that the `privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted, depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected. Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-07-25T14:54:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-03T20:03:57", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/strapi/strapi/security/advisories/GHSA-chmr-rg2f-9jmf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34093", "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/commit/2fa8f30371bfd1db44c15e5747860ee5789096de", "https://github.com/strapi/strapi", "https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v4.10.8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34093", "GHSA-chmr-rg2f-9jmf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "005f2d36-d82c-3289-a404-8c22f7ab48df", "product": {"name": "Strapi"}, "product_version": "< 4.10.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c1c3d08c-78e3-322a-bb7d-11c2f45b76e3", "vendor": {"name": "strapi"}}], "isExploited": false}
