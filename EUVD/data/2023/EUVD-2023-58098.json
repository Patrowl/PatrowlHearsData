This is due to function utilizing an unsafe extract() method to extract values from the POST variable and passing that input to the include() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include arbitrary PHP files and achieve remote code execution. On vulnerable Docker configurations it may be possible for an attacker to create a PHP file and then subsequently include it to achieve RCE.", "datePublished": "2023-11-22T15:33:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-10T13:32:30", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2f2bdf11-401a-48af-b1dc-aeeb40b9a384?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-designer-pack/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2984052%40blog-designer-pack&new=2984052%40blog-designer-pack&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.leavesongs.com/PENETRATION/docker-php-include-getshell.html#0x06-pearcmdphp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-5815"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 48.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a1b2b30b-cc22-33e0-8176-4ea1e4402ef5", "product": {"name": "News & Blog Designer Pack \u2013 WordPress Blog Plugin \u2014 (Blog Post Grid, Blog Post Slider, Blog Post Carousel, Blog Post Ticker, Blog Post Masonry)"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ebec7f77-4ad2-3bc1-aa92-c8eea6effe50", "vendor": {"name": "InfornWeb"}}], "isExploited": false}
