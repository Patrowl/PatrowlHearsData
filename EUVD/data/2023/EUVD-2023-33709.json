The userspace \"data->block[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and was used as the size of a memcpy, possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a local privileged user to crash the system or potentially achieve code execution.", "datePublished": "2023-04-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:22:08", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2188396", "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/92fbb6d1296f", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-2194"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07333a58-09e7-3265-aa3a-b840829b53bd", "product": {"name": "Linux kernel: i2c: xgene-slimpro"}, "product_version": "Fixed in kernel v6.3-rc4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b0cd7a8e-78fe-3957-a6fd-ecd9ed48c91c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
