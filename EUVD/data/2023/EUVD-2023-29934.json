On the Working Set Manager page, users can create a Working Set with a name that has a client-side template injection payload. Input validation is missing during creation of the working set. For an external attacker, it is very difficult to exploit this, because a few dynamically created parameters such as Jsession-id, a CSRF token, and an Nxsrf token would be needed. The attack can realistically only be performed by an internal user.", "datePublished": "2023-04-24T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-04T16:32:14", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:L/AV:N/A:N/C:H/I:N/PR:L/S:C/UI:R", "references": ["https://nokia.com", "https://www.ptsecurity.com/ww-en/analytics/threatscape/pt-2022-04/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26060"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b1713166-77a2-33e0-b886-d657151c4bcd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f1cef0b-62b4-378c-a48d-590559ed0382", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
