This is due to a lack of nonce validation and insufficient validation of the instance_id on the 'updraftmethod-googledrive-auth' action used to update Google Drive remote storage location. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Drive location that backups are sent to via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can make it possible for attackers to receive backups for a site which may contain sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2023-11-07T20:31:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-05T18:48:39", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e1be11c5-0a44-4816-b6bf-d330cb51dbf3?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2989669/updraftplus/tags/1.23.11/class-updraftplus.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-5982"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1443886d-6f77-3c3c-bade-1fda8940558d", "product": {"name": "UpdraftPlus: WordPress Backup & Migration Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.23.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "203aba02-3ef3-3c4f-b47d-3ad97de06db3", "vendor": {"name": "davidanderson"}}], "isExploited": false}
