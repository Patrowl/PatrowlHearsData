Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect vulnerability in the \"Sign In with GitHub\" functionality of Novu's open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-Source deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users should upgrade to version 0.16.0 to receive a patch.", "datePublished": "2023-07-06T14:47:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T19:16:20", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/novuhq/novu/security/advisories/GHSA-xxv3-m43w-gv79", "https://github.com/novuhq/novu/pull/3510"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-35948"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34f234cc-05de-3346-afcb-ebe895b8414e", "product": {"name": "novu"}, "product_version": "< 0.16.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fbffb64d-d88f-31bb-b943-a253f99cf446", "vendor": {"name": "novuhq"}}], "isExploited": false}
