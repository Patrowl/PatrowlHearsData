An attacker who uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.", "datePublished": "2023-10-31T15:23:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T18:54:52", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-wjcc-cq79-p63f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46250", "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2264", "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/commit/9b23ac3c9619492570011d551d521690de9a3e2d", "https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46250", "GHSA-wjcc-cq79-p63f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c22c2dad-10ab-37c2-98ac-e81283d917cb", "product": {"name": "pypdf"}, "product_version": "3.7.0, < 3.17.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ba888c9-2050-34d1-90ac-3f0aa25da94e", "vendor": {"name": "py-pdf"}}], "isExploited": false}
