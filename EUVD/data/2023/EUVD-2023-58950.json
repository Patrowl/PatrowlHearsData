This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to know the ID of an attachment uploaded by the user they are attacking.", "datePublished": "2024-01-11T08:32:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:42:07", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c37d8218-6059-46f2-a5d9-d7c22486211e?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3010103%40enable-media-replace%2Ftrunk&old=2990561%40enable-media-replace%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6737"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 4.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1b03f77d-b3d9-3993-b0de-b0c70f6a471e", "product": {"name": "Enable Media Replace"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.1.4"}, {"id": "523ae039-ec9d-33cc-b7cf-5ec7c5096dca", "product": {"name": "Enable Media Replace"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f7823461-60bf-3278-bb70-7d05a48b8f13", "vendor": {"name": "shortpixel"}}], "isExploited": false}
