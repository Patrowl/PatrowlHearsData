The vulnerabilities are caused by a lack of input validation and access control in the staff/register.php endpoint and the edit-my-profile.php page. By sending a series of specially crafted requests to the RemoteClinic application, an attacker can create admin users with more privileges than their own, upload a PHP file containing arbitrary code, and execute arbitrary commands via the PHP shell.", "datePublished": "2023-11-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T14:01:44", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/remoteclinic/RemoteClinic/issues/24"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-33480"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13f9f90b-fcba-39be-995a-27b9547030d1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ca5586f-8933-30cf-8c6b-992e293e0cc1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
