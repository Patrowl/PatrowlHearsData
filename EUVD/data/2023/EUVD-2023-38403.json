Since Xen itself\nneeds to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run\ndirectly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this\nmeans running on the shadow of the guest root page table.\n\nIn the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool\nassociated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This\ntearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in\nquestion is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to\nsupposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,\nthe time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.\n", "datePublished": "2024-01-05T16:18:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:16:35", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-438.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34322", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-438.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34322"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee6acc98-2e84-38b5-9af8-36f016b0d89b", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ee6acc98-2e84-38b5-9af8-36f016b0d89b", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
