The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`). This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.", "datePublished": "2023-07-18T18:19:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T17:24:17", "baseScore": 2.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-3rw2-wfc8-wmj5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37481", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/8beaace082b325e693dc7682029a3cb7e6c2b69d", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.16.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37481", "GHSA-3rw2-wfc8-wmj5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b10171cd-3b49-3101-9c7f-9de27347468c", "product": {"name": "fides"}, "product_version": "2.11.0, < 2.16.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b830f9d-fb37-3813-ac7c-e154c539933f", "vendor": {"name": "ethyca"}}], "isExploited": false}
