This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the system CLI. An attacker with privileges to run commands could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to an affected device using either local terminal access or a management shell interface and then submitting crafted input to the system CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. An attacker with limited user privileges could use this vulnerability to gain complete control over the system. Note: For additional information about specific impacts, see the Details section of this advisory.", "datePublished": "2023-03-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:32:57", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-xe-sdwan-VQAhEjYw"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20035"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "53368ca1-d2bf-39ee-95d4-6db6179e8046", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bed5ffc0-1f49-395d-9c67-148f26972269", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
