This vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2023-03-03T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:33:23", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-finesse-proxy-dos-vY5dQhrV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20088"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee069fc1-1806-3404-9c77-909631b054ed", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ccbba89-d6b9-3eb2-a50d-9e4195d78869", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
