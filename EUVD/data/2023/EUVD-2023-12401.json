This could also allow them to read non PHP files and retrieve their content. RCE could also be achieved if the attacker manage to upload a malicious image containing PHP code, and then include it via the affected attribute, on a default WP install, authors could easily achieve that given that they have the upload_file capability.", "datePublished": "2023-03-20T15:52:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-26T18:49:48", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/71956598-90aa-4557-947a-c4716674543d"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0340"], "assigner": "WPScan", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7bb285d1-3d85-3a75-bfa1-cf5ce64c48f8", "product": {"name": "Custom Content Shortcode"}, "product_version": "0 \u22644.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6a9fbfb1-2d54-3f20-97d6-6c2bc45053bc", "vendor": {"name": "Unknown"}}], "isExploited": false}
