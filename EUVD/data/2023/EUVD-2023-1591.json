In versions 3.9.17 and lower of vm2 it was possible to get a read-write reference to the node `inspect` method and edit options for `console.log`. As a result a threat actor can edit options for the `console.log` command. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may make the `inspect` method readonly with `vm.readonly(inspect)` after creating a vm.", "datePublished": "2023-05-15T19:45:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-22T21:42:56", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32313", "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/5206ba25afd86ef547a2c9d48d46ca7a9e6ec238", "https://gist.github.com/arkark/c1c57eaf3e0a649af1a70c2b93b17550", "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2", "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/3.9.18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32313", "GHSA-p5gc-c584-jj6v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "92980bbc-80fa-3a22-9152-1c0f1907f069", "product": {"name": "vm2"}, "product_version": "< 3.9.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "50f04baf-596c-3d4a-8c7d-45e94f37e78c", "vendor": {"name": "patriksimek"}}], "isExploited": false}
