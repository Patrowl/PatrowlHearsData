Starting in version 0.2.0 and prior to versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 2.2.5, and 3.1.1, improper escaping when presenting stored form submissions allowed for an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Scripting attack. The vulnerability was initially patched in version 1.0.2, and version 1.1.0 includes this patch. The bug was then accidentally re-introduced during a merge error, and has been re-patched in versions 2.2.5 and 3.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-04-03T17:36:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-11T14:36:08", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/security/advisories/GHSA-38h6-gmr2-j4wx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28851", "https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/commit/3a7a3c480e3fccddce9c5f359796d45a8302a622", "https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture/commit/5b3aa39dd1eef042f173167b0fa4d3f717971772", "https://github.com/bigfork/silverstripe-form-capture"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28851", "GHSA-38h6-gmr2-j4wx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6e0b7db6-51e7-312a-bce1-09336482a62f", "product": {"name": "silverstripe-form-capture"}, "product_version": "0.2.0, < 1.0.2"}, {"id": "c4553c8e-62c0-3555-a825-6aeece696bb5", "product": {"name": "silverstripe-form-capture"}, "product_version": "3.0.0, < 3.1.1"}, {"id": "f73db95e-712a-3db6-ad83-f4b839fa225f", "product": {"name": "silverstripe-form-capture"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8dff4df5-10a8-3c82-8b84-cf13fe7c1ab7", "vendor": {"name": "bigfork"}}], "isExploited": false}
