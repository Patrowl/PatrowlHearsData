Prior to version 0.3.0, ironic and ironic-inspector deployed within Baremetal Operator using the included `deploy.sh` store their `.htpasswd` files as ConfigMaps instead of Secrets. This causes the plain-text username and hashed password to be readable by anyone having a cluster-wide read-access to the management cluster, or access to the management cluster's Etcd storage. This issue is patched in baremetal-operator PR#1241, and is included in BMO release 0.3.0 onwards. As a workaround, users may modify the kustomizations and redeploy the BMO, or recreate the required ConfigMaps as Secrets per instructions in baremetal-operator PR#1241.", "datePublished": "2023-04-26T18:24:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-30T21:30:50", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/security/advisories/GHSA-9wh7-397j-722m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30841", "https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator/pull/1241", "https://github.com/metal3-io/baremetal-operator"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30841", "GHSA-9wh7-397j-722m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b508d442-5be6-3005-abac-c7888a977fa9", "product": {"name": "baremetal-operator"}, "product_version": "< 0.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b6421886-89b5-3118-bc26-4254bf89c1c8", "vendor": {"name": "metal3-io"}}], "isExploited": false}
