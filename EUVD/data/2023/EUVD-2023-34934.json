The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to multiple SQL injections in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value and the `full_sql` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `execute_check` in `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/clickhouse.py` `query` method, `execute_check` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py` `query` method, `execute_check` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which passes unsafe user input into the `object_name_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which in turn is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-102`.", "datePublished": "2023-04-18T22:35:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:28:51", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-hvcq-r2r2-34ch"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30553"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.75, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3778fb3-ad46-3698-9b80-5ba311cc34a1", "product": {"name": "Archery"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ada5928a-cbc3-39ad-ba49-ccf5a915af63", "vendor": {"name": "hhyo"}}], "isExploited": false}
