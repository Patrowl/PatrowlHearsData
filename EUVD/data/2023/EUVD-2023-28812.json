Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. During forwarding of a fragment an uninitialized entry in the reassembly buffer is used. The NULL pointer dereference triggers a hard fault exception resulting in denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams or apply the patches manually.", "datePublished": "2023-04-24T14:23:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-04T19:10:24", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-69h9-vj5r-xcg6", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/0bec3e245ed3815ad6c8cae54673f0021777768b", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/17c70f7ee0b1445f2941f516f264ed4a096e82b7", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18817/commits/aa27ed71fa3e5d48dee1748dcf27b6323ec98a33", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/4b23d93868a28edd8ebf2ff4ebe94540f2475008", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/f4df5b4c4f841ccb460930894cf68ab10b55b971", "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pull/18820/commits/f4fb746d1acaacc962daeed3aa71aadfe307d20e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-24818"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cabe471c-d853-392f-9f1e-d46046166a83", "product": {"name": "RIOT"}, "product_version": "< 2022.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39b6c7d2-6616-391e-9216-2ff850bbeea6", "vendor": {"name": "RIOT-OS"}}], "isExploited": false}
