An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number of signatures to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on the machine, if a user runs notation verify command on the same machine. The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries.", "datePublished": "2023-06-06T18:13:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T15:54:14", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/security/advisories/GHSA-rvrx-rrwh-r9p6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33958", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-33958", "GHSA-rvrx-rrwh-r9p6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8bb6db7a-cbf1-369e-b7b4-ca6593df7148", "product": {"name": "notation"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0-rc.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c763e5a8-473e-3bcf-9d06-04e981196c51", "vendor": {"name": "notaryproject"}}], "isExploited": false}
