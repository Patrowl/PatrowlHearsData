Instances relying on an allow-listed reset URL are vulnerable to an HTML injection attack through the use of query parameters in the reset URL. An attacker could exploit this to email users urls to the servers domain but which may contain malicious code. The problem has been resolved and released under version 9.23.0. People relying on a custom password reset URL should upgrade to 9.23.0 or later, or remove the custom reset url from the configured allow list. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the custom reset URL allow list as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2023-03-06T16:43:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T15:01:29", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/directus/directus/security/advisories/GHSA-4hmq-ggrm-qfc6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27474", "https://github.com/directus/directus/issues/17119", "https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/17120", "https://github.com/directus/directus"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27474", "GHSA-4hmq-ggrm-qfc6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d6816ee3-9303-376f-896b-229cbb76df2c", "product": {"name": "directus"}, "product_version": "< 9.23.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "852e4a0f-e7d0-3c45-a852-28e3564f2d7e", "vendor": {"name": "directus"}}], "isExploited": false}
