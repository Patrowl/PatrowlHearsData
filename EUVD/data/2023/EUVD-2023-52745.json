When executing a `:s` command for the very first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes free-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial `:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only reliably for the very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-11-22T22:03:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:18:19", "baseScore": 3.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-c8qm-x72m-q53q", "https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/13552", "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/26c11c56888d01e298cd8044caf860f3c26f57bb", "https://github.com/gandalf4a/crash_report/blob/main/vim/vim_huaf", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/22/3", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DNMFS3IH74KEMMESOA3EOB6MZ56TWGFF/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IVA7K73WHQH4KVFDJQ7ELIUD2WK5ZT5E/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240105-0001/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48706"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e5d43ff8-455b-3c02-acf8-ecee9cb8b839", "product": {"name": "vim"}, "product_version": "< 9.0.2121"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eec926c0-6756-32b5-93df-6c5efe7b7579", "vendor": {"name": "vim"}}], "isExploited": false}
