Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the Frigate server (e.g. via \"drive-by\" attack). Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and possible data exfiltration. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.", "datePublished": "2023-10-30T22:38:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T20:21:16", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-xq49-hv88-jr6h", "https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/09/07/why-are-developers-vulnerable-to-driveby-attacks/", "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/5658e5a4cc7376504af9de5e1eff178939a13e7f/frigate/http.py#L1060", "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/blob/6aedc39a9a421cf48000a727f36b4c1495848a1d/frigate/http.py#L998", "https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/discussions/8366", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-190_Frigate/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45670"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b905aa3-92a1-31e6-b30d-3feab0eb5919", "product": {"name": "frigate"}, "product_version": "< 0.13.0-beta3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cc4456dd-3cfe-3a7d-a88b-b79f5f172775", "vendor": {"name": "blakeblackshear"}}], "isExploited": false}
