Users publishing a composer.phar to a public web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed as a php file may be subject to a remote code execution vulnerability if PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini. Versions 2.6.4, 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not best practice.", "datePublished": "2023-09-29T19:33:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-18T13:59:58", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/composer/composer/security/advisories/GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43655", "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/4fce14795aba98e40b6c4f5047305aba17a6120d", "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/955a48e6319c8962e5cd421b07c00ab3c728968c", "https://github.com/composer/composer/commit/95e091c921037b7b6564942845e7b738f6b95c9c", "https://github.com/composer/composer", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00030.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/66H2WKFUO255T3BZTL72TNYJYH2XM5FG", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7AWYAUZNH565NWPIKGEIYBWHYNM5JGAE", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KFOPGPW2KS37O3KJWBRGTUWHTXCQXBS2", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KFOPGPW2KS37O3KJWBRGTUWHTXCQXBS2/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7AWYAUZNH565NWPIKGEIYBWHYNM5JGAE/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/66H2WKFUO255T3BZTL72TNYJYH2XM5FG/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-43655", "GHSA-jm6m-4632-36hf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7d99e5b2-3aa5-38ff-b4d5-ce96a520b19a", "product": {"name": "composer"}, "product_version": "2.6.4, 2.2.21, 1.10.27"}, {"id": "a1e583a5-5d6f-30cc-95cb-4a3e9e2c9eaa", "product": {"name": "composer"}, "product_version": "2.0, < 2.2.22"}, {"id": "f9681faf-3715-3256-8a15-f212df219c72", "product": {"name": "composer"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.27"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c4243e7-a9e7-325f-aa45-0e1617baebd2", "vendor": {"name": "composer"}}], "isExploited": false}
