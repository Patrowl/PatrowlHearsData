This is a collision attack on long IDs (64bits) for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle are vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in their dependency verification metadata file. The fix is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint is used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata. The problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As a workaround, use only full fingerprint IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in the metadata is a protection against this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-03-02T03:11:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-05T21:15:36", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-26053.html", "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/security/advisories/GHSA-c724-3xg7-g3hf", "https://github.com/gradle/gradle/commit/bf3cc0f2b463033037e67aaacda31291643ea1a9", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230413-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26053"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0227c684-aa9b-3ff4-bb0e-830b4b653df8", "product": {"name": "gradle"}, "product_version": "6.2, < 6.9.4"}, {"id": "5d885518-8bfe-3fca-ade9-0e85753f08f9", "product": {"name": "gradle"}, "product_version": "7.0.0, < 7.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a847f9f-a91f-3e4b-ba91-5ebf1d532d5a", "vendor": {"name": "gradle"}}], "isExploited": false}
