A sub-feature of this are Shadow Stacks (CET-SS).\nCET-SS is a hardware feature designed to protect against Return Oriented\nProgramming attacks. When enabled, traditional stacks holding both data\nand return addresses are accompanied by so called \"shadow stacks\",\nholding little more than return addresses.  Shadow stacks aren't\nwritable by normal instructions, and upon function returns their\ncontents are used to check for possible manipulation of a return address\ncoming from the traditional stack.\n\nIn particular certain memory accesses need intercepting by Xen.  In\nvarious cases the necessary emulation involves kind of replaying of\nthe instruction.  Such replaying typically involves filling and then\ninvoking of a stub.  Such a replayed instruction may raise an\nexceptions, which is expected and dealt with accordingly.\n\nUnfortunately the interaction of both of the above wasn't right:\nRecovery involves removal of a call frame from the (traditional) stack.\nThe counterpart of this operation for the shadow stack was missing.", "datePublished": "2024-03-20T10:40:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T18:18:57", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-451.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZON4TLXG7TG4A2XZG563JMVTGQW4SF3A/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46841", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-451.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HES2IJXZY3H7HBPP4NVSVYYNGW254DMI"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46841"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29edea8e-31b4-3e56-a1ce-af49657dfd6f", "product": {"name": "Xen"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "29edea8e-31b4-3e56-a1ce-af49657dfd6f", "vendor": {"name": "Xen"}}], "isExploited": false}
