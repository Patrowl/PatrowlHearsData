By frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all. This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection as a workaround.", "datePublished": "2023-06-07T17:06:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T16:01:54", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-5h3x-9wvq-w4m2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34234", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/commit/66f390fa516b550838e2c2f65132b5bc2afe1ced", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/d9474327a492f9f310f31bc53f38dbea56ed9a57", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34234", "GHSA-5h3x-9wvq-w4m2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e6182ff7-212d-3d41-bd56-970a38db42a7", "product": {"name": "openzeppelin-contracts"}, "product_version": "4.3.0, < 4.9.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5fe97f49-8349-3cf8-97c9-df5b3ad27935", "vendor": {"name": "OpenZeppelin"}}], "isExploited": false}
