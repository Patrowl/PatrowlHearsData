Grav is subject to a server side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability. The fix for another SSTI vulnerability using `|map`, `|filter` and `|reduce` twigs implemented in the commit `71bbed1` introduces bypass of the denylist due to incorrect return value from `isDangerousFunction()`, which allows to execute the payload prepending double backslash (`\\\\`). The `isDangerousFunction()` check in version 1.7.42 and onwards retuns `false` value instead of `true` when the `\\` symbol is found in the `$name`. This vulnerability can be exploited if the attacker has access to: 1. an Administrator account, or 2. a non-administrator, user account that has Admin panel access and Create/Update page permissions. A fix for this vulnerability has been introduced in commit `b4c6210` and is included in release version `1.7.42.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-18T20:22:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T17:19:07", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/getgrav/grav/security/advisories/GHSA-9436-3gmp-4f53", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37897", "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/71bbed12f950de8335006d7f91112263d8504f1b", "https://github.com/getgrav/grav/commit/b4c62101a43051fc7f5349c7d0a5b6085375c1d7", "https://github.com/getgrav/grav"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37897", "GHSA-9436-3gmp-4f53"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "86b044bb-36fc-3bd8-b24d-1493f21e3782", "product": {"name": "grav"}, "product_version": "< 1.7.42.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a8590ba0-0644-3cdc-a79a-6cd9235639f6", "vendor": {"name": "getgrav"}}], "isExploited": false}
