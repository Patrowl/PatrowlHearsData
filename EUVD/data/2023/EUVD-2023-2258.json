Starting in version 22.1.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests. There is no evidence that the issue was exploited on `sentry.io`. For self-hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens. A fix is available in version 23.7.2 of `sentry` and `self-hosted`. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-08-07T18:27:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-04T19:12:12", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-9jcq-jf57-c62c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39349", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/53850", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/fad12c1150d1135edf9666ea72ca11bc110c1083", "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.7.2", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/releases/tag/23.7.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39349", "GHSA-9jcq-jf57-c62c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07c71e90-5fba-3f7e-bf0c-ce65f77ddccc", "product": {"name": "sentry"}, "product_version": "22.1.0, < 23.7.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a361f75f-3125-3c94-8124-f4e606c5f73e", "vendor": {"name": "getsentry"}}], "isExploited": false}
