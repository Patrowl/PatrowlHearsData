When a collaboration is deleted, the linked resources (such as tasks from that collaboration) should be deleted. This is partly to manage data properly, but also to prevent a potential (but unlikely) side-effect that affects versions prior to 4.0.0, where if a collaboration with id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration is created with id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-10-11T11:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-10-18T08:26:18", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/pull/748", "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/blob/0682c4288f43fee5bcc72dc448cdd99bd7e57f76/docs/release_notes.rst#400", "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-rf54-7qrr-96j6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41881", "https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/commit/cce9538f8b70e814c080dd0ae43b297f3af8a732", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/vantage6/PYSEC-2023-200.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41881", "GHSA-rf54-7qrr-96j6", "PYSEC-2023-200"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8b347c5-8d89-3fe3-a740-9d6345814057", "product": {"name": "vantage6"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70ca3cfe-5c52-3867-898c-c986a32ab837", "vendor": {"name": "vantage6"}}], "isExploited": false}
