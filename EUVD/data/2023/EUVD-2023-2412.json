{"id": "EUVD-2023-2412", "enisaUuid": "9750b9be-ffb9-3475-89a6-6100ed39a771", "description": "yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. yt-dlp allows the user to provide shell command lines to be executed at various stages in its download steps through the `--exec` flag. This flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell. However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's `subprocess` on Windows) does not properly escape special characters, which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts `yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`. Support for output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version 2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special character. `\\n` will be replaced by `\\r` as no way of escaping it has been found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24 as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec, because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For Windows users who are not able to upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output template expansion in --exec other than {} (filepath). 2. If expansion in --exec is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain \", | or &. 3. Instead of using --exec, write the info json and load the fields from it instead.\n", "datePublished": "2023-09-25T18:54:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-24T14:48:55", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-42h4-v29r-42qg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40581", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/de015e930747165dbb8fcd360f8775fd973b7d6e", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases/tag/2023.09.24.003044", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2021.04.11", "https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2023.09.24"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40581", "GHSA-42h4-v29r-42qg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 4.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e537450-47f0-30f4-83c7-66c4eef8b402", "product": {"name": "yt-dlp"}, "product_version": "2021.04.11, < 2023.09.24"}, {"id": "416bda9f-35d1-38c7-bd96-24f818b75e84", "product": {"name": "yt-dlp"}, "product_version": "< nightly 2023.09.24.003044"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96e4a1ec-5faa-305a-bfb1-a84f26e1e490", "vendor": {"name": "yt-dlp"}}], "isExploited": false}
