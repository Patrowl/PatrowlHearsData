This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DCS-8300LHV2 IP cameras. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the Authorization header by the RTSP server, which listens on TCP port 554. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
