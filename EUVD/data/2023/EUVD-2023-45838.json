Starting in version 3.20 and prior to version 3.22, `shdr_verify_signature` can make a double free. `shdr_verify_signature` used to verify a TA binary before it is loaded. To verify a signature of it, allocate a memory for RSA key. RSA key allocate function (`sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key`) will try to allocate a memory (which is optee\u2019s heap memory). RSA key is consist of exponent and modulus (represent as variable `e`, `n`) and it allocation is not atomic way, so it may succeed in `e` but fail in `n`. In this case sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key` will free on `e` and return as it is failed but variable \u2018e\u2019 is remained as already freed memory address . `shdr_verify_signature` will free again that memory (which is `e`) even it is freed when it failed allocate RSA key. A patch is available in version 3.22. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2023-09-15T19:40:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T18:49:09", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/security/advisories/GHSA-jrw7-63cq-7vhm", "https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/commit/e2ec831cb07ed0099535c7c140cb6338aa62816a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41325"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4378359f-1091-30bf-8c53-a165f6d2ea99", "product": {"name": "optee_os"}, "product_version": "3.20, < 3.22"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e0d0caaf-ec51-3a7a-ae1d-8f3ad5ccef28", "vendor": {"name": "OP-TEE"}}], "isExploited": false}
