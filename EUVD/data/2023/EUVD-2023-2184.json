Prior to version 32.5.1, the software has a possible command injection vulnerability in the docker fetch process as it allows to append malicious commands in the `docker_reference` parameter.\n\nIn the function `scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py:fetch_docker_image` the parameter `docker_reference` is user controllable. The `docker_reference` variable is then passed to the vulnerable function `get_docker_image_platform`.  However, the `get_docker_image_plaform` function constructs a shell command with the passed `docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell command without any prior sanitization, making the function vulnerable to command injections. A malicious user who is able to create or add inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback without logs, it is still possible to cause damage to the server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;`, it would allow appending malicious commands.\n\nVersion 32.5.1 contains a patch for this issue. The `docker_reference` input should be sanitized to avoid command injections and, as a workaround, one may avoid creating commands with user controlled input directly.", "datePublished": "2023-08-07T20:55:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-03T16:00:56", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-2ggp-cmvm-f62f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39523", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/commit/07ec0de1964b14bf085a1c9a27ece2b61ab6105c", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/blob/main/scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py#L185", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/releases/tag/v32.5.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39523", "GHSA-2ggp-cmvm-f62f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34b682d7-eb7d-361f-803d-4ad931764a5e", "product": {"name": "scancode.io"}, "product_version": "< 32.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "356ce070-ead4-399b-982c-ef960c7dcce3", "vendor": {"name": "nexB"}}], "isExploited": false}
