The fix applied for CVE-2023-39515 in version 1.2.25 is incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-site scripting attack, the adversary needs to be an authorized cacti user with the following permissions: `General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data`. The victim of this attack could be any account with permissions to view `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_debug.php`. As of time of publication, no complete fix has been included in Cacti.", "datePublished": "2023-12-22T16:16:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:18:33", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-q7g7-gcf6-wh4x", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-hrg9-qqqx-wc4h", "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/blob/5f6f65c215d663a775950b2d9db35edbaf07d680/data_debug.php", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00018.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49088"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e3902c52-872f-374c-95d0-a8080ad12c88", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8bd163bd-bc28-3366-9e06-ad685e672d50", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
