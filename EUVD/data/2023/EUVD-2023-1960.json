{"id": "EUVD-2023-1960", "enisaUuid": "5f9b16f6-0dfd-395e-961c-ef59669bbd1b", "description": "The package snyk before 1.1064.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection when analyzing a project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include commands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as \u2018trusted\u2019 in order to be vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well. The affected IDE plugins and versions are: - VS Code - Affected: <=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 - IntelliJ - Affected: <=2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48 - Visual Studio - Affected: <=1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31 - Eclipse - Affected: <=v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions - Language Server - Affected: <=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions", "datePublished": "2022-11-30T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-24T19:54:51", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24441", "https://github.com/snyk/snyk-eclipse-plugin/commit/b5a8bce25a359ced75f83a729fc6b2393fc9a495", "https://github.com/snyk/snyk-intellij-plugin/commit/56682f4ba6081ce1d95cb980cbfacd3809a826f4", "https://github.com/snyk/snyk-ls/commit/b3229f0142f782871aa72d1a7dcf417546d568ed", "https://github.com/snyk/snyk-visual-studio-plugin/commit/0b53dbbd4a3153c3ef9aaf797af3b5caad0f731a", "https://github.com/snyk/vscode-extension/commit/0db3b4240be0db6a0a5c6d02c0d4231a2c4ba708", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3111871", "https://www.imperva.com/blog/how-scanning-your-projects-for-security-issues-can-lead-to-remote-code-execution", "https://www.imperva.com/blog/how-scanning-your-projects-for-security-issues-can-lead-to-remote-code-execution/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-24441", "GHSA-4vrv-93c7-m92j"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 1.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "223fa0dc-24f7-33d9-b7ce-03aad162464a", "product": {"name": "snyk"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.1064.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3343660f-0fc6-3027-b2a5-cb5499bff8a9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
