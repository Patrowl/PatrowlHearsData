It connects new devices in a manner that allows the new device to communicate with all Teltonika devices connected to the VPN. The OpenVPN server also allows users to route through it. An attacker could route a connection to a remote server through the OpenVPN server, enabling them to scan and access data from other Teltonika devices connected to the VPN.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-05-22T15:02:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-16T21:34:53", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-131-08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32348"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "05e8ab59-2826-3337-b138-116b41d93d59", "product": {"name": "Remote Management System"}, "product_version": "0 <4.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80ef87b4-32c0-3853-a06e-f7c61ca0a9cf", "vendor": {"name": "Teltonika"}}], "isExploited": false}
