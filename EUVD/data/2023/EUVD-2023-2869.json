A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability is present in applications utilizing the `google-translate-api-browser` package and exposing the `translateOptions` to the end user. An attacker can set a malicious `tld`, causing the application to return unsafe URLs pointing towards local resources. The `translateOptions.tld` field is not properly sanitized before being placed in the Google translate URL. This can allow an attacker with control over the `translateOptions` to set the `tld` to a payload such as `@127.0.0.1`. This causes the full URL to become `https://translate.google.@127.0.0.1/...`, where `translate.google.` is the username used to connect to localhost. An attacker can send requests within internal networks and the local host. Should any HTTPS application be present on the internal network with a vulnerability exploitable via a GET call, then it would be possible to exploit this using this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-24T17:06:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T21:37:54", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cjvnjde/google-translate-api-browser/security/advisories/GHSA-4233-7q5q-m7p6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48711", "https://github.com/cjvnjde/google-translate-api-browser/commit/33c2eac4a21c6504409e7b06dd16e6346f93d34b", "https://github.com/cjvnjde/google-translate-api-browser"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48711", "GHSA-4233-7q5q-m7p6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58c5faba-4377-3ba2-b3c6-989b5923c1f8", "product": {"name": "google-translate-api-browser"}, "product_version": "< 4.1.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3a09240e-6242-3134-ba23-0ae226bd5f22", "vendor": {"name": "cjvnjde"}}], "isExploited": false}
