These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T15:59:00", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-vqz7gC8W"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20147"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "46d1b6c9-26e4-3434-aeb6-cac954d55250", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "90cb76cf-7c3c-3e20-a15a-c8d76e11fc3d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
