There is Local Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM via a Stack Overflow in RTLCopyMemory (IOCTL 0x1b2150). An attacker can exploit this to elevate privileges from a medium-integrity process to SYSTEM. This can also be used to bypass kernel-level protections such as AV or PPL, because exploit code runs with high-integrity privileges and can be used in coordinated BYOVD (bring your own vulnerable driver) ransomware campaigns.", "datePublished": "2023-10-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-19T14:04:25", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.broadcom.com", "https://cschwarz1.github.io/posts/0x04/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31096"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c917fbe-ec4c-3470-877f-f607a6c48bfd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eb86601e-7b8d-3360-ac3f-42d258f009ff", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
