In affected versions a well-crafted string passed to avro's `github.com/hamba/avro/v2.Unmarshal()` can throw a `fatal error: runtime: out of memory` which is unrecoverable and can cause denial of service of the consumer of avro. The root cause of the issue is that avro uses part of the input to `Unmarshal()` to determine the size when creating a new slice and hence an attacker may consume arbitrary amounts of memory which in turn may cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `b4a402f4` which has been included in release version `2.13.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-07-17T16:36:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T17:38:36", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/hamba/avro/security/advisories/GHSA-9x44-9pgq-cf45", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37475", "https://github.com/hamba/avro/pull/273", "https://github.com/hamba/avro/commit/b4a402f41cf44b6094b5131286830ba9bb1eb290", "https://github.com/hamba/avro", "https://github.com/hamba/avro/blob/3abfe1e6382c5dccf2e1a00260c51a64bc1f1ca1/reader.go#L216-L242", "https://github.com/hamba/avro/releases/tag/v2.13.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37475", "GHSA-9x44-9pgq-cf45"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c60d3888-dced-37b3-92a2-31b7d5f67f74", "product": {"name": "avro"}, "product_version": "< 2.13.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c477b958-7e59-3e5f-a087-e54747e2a622", "vendor": {"name": "hamba"}}], "isExploited": false}
