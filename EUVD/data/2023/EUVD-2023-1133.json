There is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the indices that back data streams potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. OpenSearch 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2022-11-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:37:15", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/security/advisories/GHSA-wmx7-x4jp-9jgg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41918", "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/commit/f7cc569c9d3fa5d5432c76c854eed280d45ce6f4", "https://github.com/opensearch-project/security"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-41918", "GHSA-wmx7-x4jp-9jgg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "73811059-1e8b-3e70-8643-644de83a5dc8", "product": {"name": "security"}, "product_version": "<1.3.7"}, {"id": "f4a2e8e5-07ba-3911-8c0b-c5f3a4e0ac29", "product": {"name": "security"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "90dc4e84-9d13-347a-841e-bfe2da6f6be5", "vendor": {"name": "opensearch-project"}}], "isExploited": false}
