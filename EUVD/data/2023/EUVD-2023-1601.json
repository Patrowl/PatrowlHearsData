Prior to version 16.0.2, users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing `/` characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. Attempting to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work. Creating a shard using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI validates the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to version 0.16.2 of the `go` module, contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Always use `vtctldclient` to create shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating shards from VTAdmin using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending shard using the client for your topology server.", "datePublished": "2023-05-11T19:07:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-24T21:28:41", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/security/advisories/GHSA-pqj7-jx24-wj7w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29195", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/issues/12842", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/12843", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/9dcbd7de3180f47e94f54989fb5c66daea00c920", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/releases/tag/v16.0.2", "https://pkg.go.dev/vitess.io/vitess@v0.16.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29195", "GHSA-pqj7-jx24-wj7w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b082a477-6d2c-3a8b-8713-02b5871f89d9", "product": {"name": "vitess"}, "product_version": "< 16.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "19825df2-c555-3775-9e82-9777926ce826", "vendor": {"name": "vitessio"}}], "isExploited": false}
