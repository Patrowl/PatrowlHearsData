The tun/tap sockets have their socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions, possibly bypassing network filters.", "datePublished": "2023-03-27T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-24T17:04:30", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1076.html", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=66b2c338adce580dfce2199591e65e2bab889cff", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=a096ccca6e503a5c575717ff8a36ace27510ab0a", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1076"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 100.0, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1f4fcd03-d0c3-3f07-a6da-164e19c60af7", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
