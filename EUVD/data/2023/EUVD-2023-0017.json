Other than manually cleaning the session database (for database\u00a0session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).\\n\\nWith this fix implemented, when using the\u00a0database\u00a0session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the securecookie\u00a0session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.\\n\\nUsers of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.\\n", "datePublished": "2023-08-23T07:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-09-04T11:29:37", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33347", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/9rdmv8ln4y4ncbyrlmjrsj903x4l80nj", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/1", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/1", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40273", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/2caa186935151683076b74357daad83d2538a3f6", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/f5d8201ea7935d17cecaf25fc90d4ef0ccdd627b", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/apache-airflow/PYSEC-2023-158.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40273", "PYSEC-2023-158"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "364d6837-cb1a-3da6-9c23-83a32fc18979", "product": {"name": "Apache Airflow"}, "product_version": "0 <2.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d7d57e33-d046-3e3f-894e-7089625d0e26", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
