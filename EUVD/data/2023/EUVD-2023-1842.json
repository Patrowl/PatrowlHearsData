Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a `LookupResources` request with 1.22.0 is affected. For example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions.", "datePublished": "2023-06-26T19:32:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T21:06:28", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-m54h-5x5f-5m6r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35930", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/pull/1397", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb", "https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/releases/tag/v1.22.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-35930", "GHSA-m54h-5x5f-5m6r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19c60f74-4f8f-3207-810a-f011466add92", "product": {"name": "spicedb"}, "product_version": "= 1.22.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2d42df9c-5385-36ee-9b4d-c790cef05407", "vendor": {"name": "authzed"}}], "isExploited": false}
