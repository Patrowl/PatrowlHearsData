Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the `verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`, `procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves.\n\nA contract may be vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3 leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the tree.\n\nA contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving (`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or `processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe.\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 4.9.2.\n\nSome workarounds are available. For those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing it from the leaves.", "datePublished": "2023-06-16T22:13:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-16T18:35:27", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-wprv-93r4-jj2p", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34459", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/4d2383e17186be3e8ccf5a442e9686ecc7de1c55", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.9.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34459", "GHSA-wprv-93r4-jj2p"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "551a743b-c853-3b7d-a9f7-f4ff47b49c22", "product": {"name": "openzeppelin-contracts"}, "product_version": "4.7.0, < 4.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "320d57ef-449b-3d2a-aa17-b7514011d6be", "vendor": {"name": "OpenZeppelin"}}], "isExploited": false}
