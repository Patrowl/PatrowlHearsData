Envoy allows mixed-case schemes in HTTP/2, however, some internal scheme checks are case-sensitive. Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, this can lead to the rejection of requests with mixed-case schemes such as `htTp` or `htTps`, or the bypassing of some requests such as `https` in unencrypted connections. With a fix in versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, Envoy will now lowercase scheme values by default, and change the internal scheme checks that were case-sensitive to be case-insensitive. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-07-25T18:35:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-23T20:18:42", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-pvgm-7jpg-pw5g"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-35944"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b8733d6-9289-3bfe-878d-082a6739a66d", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.26.0, < 1.26.4"}, {"id": "b501190a-0209-3814-9cdd-b023c13958e5", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.25.0, < 1.25.9"}, {"id": "c4856faa-43e7-3597-8337-e5934199e55e", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "1.24.0, < 1.24.10"}, {"id": "e3ffac6d-7d89-34e2-bf30-9dae78c75246", "product": {"name": "envoy"}, "product_version": "< 1.23.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3b078083-dc4e-3402-8fb1-81bad8a2582a", "vendor": {"name": "envoyproxy"}}], "isExploited": false}
