Prior to versions 0.16.6 and 0.17.1 in `mutagen` and prior to version 0.17.1 in `mutagen-compose`, Mutagen `list` and `monitor` commands are susceptible to control characters that could be provided by remote endpoints.  This could cause terminal corruption, either intentional or unintentional, if these characters were present in error messages or file paths/names. This could be used as an attack vector if synchronizing with an untrusted remote endpoint, synchronizing files not under control of the user, or forwarding to/from an untrusted remote endpoint.  On very old systems with terminals susceptible to issues such as CVE-2003-0069, the issue could theoretically cause code execution. The problem has been patched in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1.  Earlier versions of Mutagen are no longer supported and will not be patched.  Versions of Mutagen after v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged. As a workaround, avoiding synchronization of untrusted files or interaction with untrusted remote endpoints should mitigate any risk.", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T17:54:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-29T15:23:41", "baseScore": 3.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/security/advisories/GHSA-jmp2-wc4p-wfh2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30844", "https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen", "https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/releases/tag/v0.16.6", "https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen/releases/tag/v0.17.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30844", "GHSA-jmp2-wc4p-wfh2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2529a3fb-90ed-347e-843c-50c1c2142048", "product": {"name": "mutagen"}, "product_version": "github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen-compose < 0.17.1"}, {"id": "5e3d00d3-d9a3-3b22-ac89-572ad7dcb645", "product": {"name": "mutagen"}, "product_version": "github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen < 0.16.6"}, {"id": "a85a944d-7676-352c-bb9c-59542289d2ff", "product": {"name": "mutagen"}, "product_version": "github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen  0.17.0, < 0.17.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "304ffd1f-2e95-31d3-b5f4-b69b37282fb8", "vendor": {"name": "mutagen-io"}}], "isExploited": false}
