An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the unexpected restart of the IS-IS process, which could cause the affected device to reload. Note: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2 adjacent to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2023-08-23T18:19:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T09:05:36", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-n3_9k-isis-dos-FTCXB4Vb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20169"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "20d214fc-56d0-39b4-9164-a52915e9f14a", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "10.3(2)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4d91e2f5-0700-308e-b922-9436cb8cbf77", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
