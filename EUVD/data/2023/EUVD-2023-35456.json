Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A low-privileged OS user with access to a Windows host where Cacti is installed can create arbitrary PHP files in a web document directory. The user can then execute the PHP files under the security context of SYSTEM. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege from a normal user account to SYSTEM. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T21:19:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:49:45", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rf5w-pq3f-9876", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31132"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9076be9-3775-34ea-bb9f-eea4f8b697f6", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6c41c459-28e9-35e2-af6b-40bd644dc62d", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
