Versions starting with 3.2.0 prior to 3.6.1 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. In the Network module, a manufacturer account can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to make the server send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server can be used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is. Furthermore, the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to a time of check time of use issue. For example, by using a custom server that returns 200 on HEAD requests, then return a valid image on first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final target on second GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-02T14:19:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-12T19:35:43", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/security/advisories/GHSA-jhww-fx2j-3rf7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46725", "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/pull/972", "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop/commit/0d5bec5c4c22e1affe7fd321a30e3f3a4d99e808", "https://github.com/foodcoopshop/foodcoopshop", "https://pastebin.com/8K5Brwbq"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46725", "GHSA-jhww-fx2j-3rf7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b7d4abe4-7077-3ad1-8bbb-4546e1ff70b9", "product": {"name": "foodcoopshop"}, "product_version": "3.2.0, < 3.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4a7df90-46ec-39c0-b9f1-039dfed4213b", "vendor": {"name": "foodcoopshop"}}], "isExploited": false}
