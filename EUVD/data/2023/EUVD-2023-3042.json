Combining two molecules to one another, called \"cross-linking\" results in a molecule with a chemical formula that is composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. In Fabric, one can take a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a way that alters the way the peers parse the transactions. If a first peer receives a block B and a second peer receives a block identical to B but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer will parse transactions in a different way and thus its world state will deviate from the first peer. Orderers or peers cannot detect that a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a vulnerability in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It simply and naively concatenates them, which is insecure and lets an adversary craft a \"cross-linked block\" (block with cross-linked transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. For example, it is possible to select a transaction and manipulate a peer to completely avoid processing it, without changing the computed hash of the block. Additional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and v2.5.5 to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing blocks. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-14T20:23:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-29T20:19:53", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/security/advisories/GHSA-v9w2-543f-h69m", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46132", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/4503", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/4504", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/389b2e66de9a6fbc6043216d554c97bbbdf0e008", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/93bef10bd3ce3c54d7f3b064f765dbde61da7def", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.2.14", "https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v2.5.5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46132", "GHSA-v9w2-543f-h69m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "196fb066-3fed-3649-8892-f8e0a55baeab", "product": {"name": "fabric"}, "product_version": "2.3.0, < 2.5.5"}, {"id": "e2bc032b-51c9-3f1a-b1b2-20365195a73a", "product": {"name": "fabric"}, "product_version": "1.0.0, < 2.2.14"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de181edc-c0ee-33e2-ac02-4389a080de03", "vendor": {"name": "Hyperledger"}}], "isExploited": false}
