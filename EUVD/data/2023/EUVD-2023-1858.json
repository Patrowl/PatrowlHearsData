Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.\n\nThe function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-06-15T16:12:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-12T16:27:54", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34453", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/820e2e074c58748b41dbd547f4edba9e108ad905", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java#L107", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34453", "GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "052f3913-4deb-3af7-b85f-8052305b5123", "product": {"name": "snappy-java"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "284044e0-ac84-3a76-870f-891e787f2272", "vendor": {"name": "xerial"}}], "isExploited": false}
