This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the console port on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and execute a limited set of commands local to the FEX, which could cause a device reboot and denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2023-02-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:04:09", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-elyfex-dos-gfvcByx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20012"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9f1cec1-977c-3751-982f-c8a5009e44ca", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c5e74c5a-807d-3ec5-a8ea-7454c247dbd2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
