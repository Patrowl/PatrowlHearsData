Due to this bug,\nthe local variable that means \"let the host resolve the name\" could get the\nwrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,\ncopy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the\nresolved address there.\n\nThe target buffer being a heap based buffer, and the host name coming from the\nURL that curl has been told to operate with.", "datePublished": "2023-10-18T03:52:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-27T20:32:53", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OGMXNRNSJ4ETDK6FRNU3J7SABXPWCHSQ/", "https://www.secpod.com/blog/high-severity-heap-buffer-overflow-vulnerability/", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214036", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214063", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214057", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT214058", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/34", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/37", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jan/38", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0005/", "https://forum.vmssoftware.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=8868", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/UTsweetyfish/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/bcdannyboy/CVE-2023-38545", "https://github.com/dbrugman/CVE-2023-38545-POC"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-38545"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 26.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e35bcccd-7d0a-3e3a-a2e5-f8285810be2d", "product": {"name": "curl"}, "product_version": "8.4.0 <8.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e242934-9e1b-3685-a409-03706824dbe3", "vendor": {"name": "curl"}}], "isExploited": false}
