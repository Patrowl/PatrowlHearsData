The type of the 1st argument is supposed to be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature, but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend` doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows `eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.\n", "datePublished": "2023-03-03T23:47:28", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T15:01:54", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vega/vega/security/advisories/GHSA-w5m3-xh75-mp55", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26487", "https://github.com/vega/vega/commit/01adb034f24727d3bb321bbbb6696a7f4cd91689", "https://github.com/vega/vega", "https://github.com/vega/vega/releases/tag/v5.23.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26487", "GHSA-w5m3-xh75-mp55"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "566c4f46-355f-3e98-b4de-7d6e10a83615", "product": {"name": "vega"}, "product_version": "< 5.23.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3a4aac80-47a9-3c0e-bf37-c135d74ef2d8", "vendor": {"name": "vega"}}], "isExploited": false}
