In versions prior to 1.5.3 when querying `subresults`, it is possible to query `subresults` from other users due to insufficient authorisation. This is only possible for logged-in users and it is not possible to associate the subresults with a specific user. This bug was fixed in commit `f1ae67d8bb2`and released with version 1.5.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-03-07T18:26:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T15:00:16", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/feedbacksystem/security/advisories/GHSA-fhq8-p3w6-mmgr", "https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/feedbacksystem/commit/f1ae67d8bb2286a8eb15949038473d41b1358493", "https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/feedbacksystem/releases/tag/v1.5.3", "https://thm-mni-ii.github.io/feedbacksystem/api-docs/#tag/Submission/operation/getCourseTaskSubmissionSubresults"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27485"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ff93539f-f645-37eb-b03c-0f17271da20c", "product": {"name": "feedbacksystem"}, "product_version": "< 1.5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "66e5232b-74f0-317f-bd14-e5745f931c5b", "vendor": {"name": "thm-mni-ii"}}], "isExploited": false}
