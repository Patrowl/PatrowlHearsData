In affected versions a user present in a yearly review topic that is then anonymised will still have some data linked to its original account. This issue has been patched in commit `b3ab33bbf7` which is included in the latest version of the Discourse Yearly Review plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the `yearly_review_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to edit the anonymised user's old data in the yearly review topics manually.", "datePublished": "2023-03-06T17:40:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T15:01:17", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/security/advisories/GHSA-x2r8-v85c-x3x7", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/commit/b3ab33bbf7130fca54764cf0336395a8a1eeaf3c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25169"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f00f21f5-39f1-3571-bc73-725e3b7ad357", "product": {"name": "discourse-yearly-review"}, "product_version": "< 0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dd077cd4-1893-327f-98a3-84f4a0f74297", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
