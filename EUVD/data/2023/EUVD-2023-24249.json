This vulnerability is due to a logic error in how memory allocations are handled during a TLS 1.3 session. Under specific, time-based constraints, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TLS 1.3 message sequence through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Snort 3 detection engine to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. While the Snort detection engine reloads, packets going through the FTD device that are sent to the Snort detection engine will be dropped. The Snort detection engine will restart automatically. No manual intervention is required.", "datePublished": "2023-11-01T17:08:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:57:35", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-snort3-uAnUntcV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20070"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "097a1735-413b-3bd4-8f85-202b93938bf6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.0.1"}, {"id": "b4588b85-4b90-373f-ae15-6a7c7184ca72", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ca8b7dc-143b-38c2-8e2d-e7db0f77b084", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
