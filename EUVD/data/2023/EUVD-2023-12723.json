This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions or above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute when the victim visits a specific link. Note that getting the JavaScript to execute still requires user interaction as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored in the site database.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T05:33:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-20T23:47:04", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1c866d8d-399c-4bda-a3c9-17c7e5d2ffb8?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/metform/trunk/base/shortcode.php?rev=2845078"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0695"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8c9c4db2-38e7-354d-9dee-ad4576c77055", "product": {"name": "Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder \u2013 Flexible and Design-Friendly Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b7fe8373-03fa-3419-bc78-d3fdfa2e6358", "vendor": {"name": "xpeedstudio"}}], "isExploited": false}
