DataHub Frontend's sessions are configured using Play Framework's default settings for stateless session which do not set an expiration time for a cookie. Due to this, if a session cookie were ever leaked, it would be valid forever. DataHub uses a stateless session cookie that is not invalidated on logout, it is just removed from the browser forcing the user to login again. However, if an attacker extracted a cookie from an authenticated user it would continue to be valid as there is no validation on a time window the session token is valid for due to a combination of the usage of LegacyCookiesModule from Play Framework and using default settings which do not set an expiration time. All DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub user, but not the default policies applying to that user are affected. Users are advised to update to version 0.12.1 which addresses the issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-14T00:33:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T14:35:43", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-75p8-rgh2-r9mx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-47628"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ce020e0d-632b-3380-b47c-adf13216183c", "product": {"name": "datahub"}, "product_version": "< 0.12.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0d7c3dea-3805-3f3c-85ca-ae779d1a2fca", "vendor": {"name": "datahub-project"}}], "isExploited": false}
