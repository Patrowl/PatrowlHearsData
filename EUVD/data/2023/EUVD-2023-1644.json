Prior to version `0.6.1`, there is a possible prototype pollution issue for the `MetadataRecord`, when merged with a base class' metadata object, in `meta` decorator from the `@aedart/support` package. The likelihood of exploitation is questionable, given that a class's metadata can only be set or altered when the class is decorated via `meta()`. Furthermore, object(s) of sensitive nature would have to be stored as metadata, before this can lead to a security impact. The issue has been patched in version `0.6.1`.\n", "datePublished": "2023-04-28T20:37:41", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-30T19:50:17", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/aedart/ion/security/advisories/GHSA-wwxh-74fx-33c6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30857", "https://github.com/aedart/ion/commit/c3e2ee08710d4164d796ecb66ed291335dae9291", "https://github.com/aedart/ion"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30857", "GHSA-wwxh-74fx-33c6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "717e9035-dacd-30bc-9808-05eda6b03cfd", "product": {"name": "ion"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "574ff6d8-b456-389f-86df-2ad9237fad31", "vendor": {"name": "aedart"}}], "isExploited": false}
