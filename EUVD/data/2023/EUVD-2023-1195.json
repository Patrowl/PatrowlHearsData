In XWiki, every user can add translations that are only applied to the current user. This also allows overriding existing translations. Such translations are often included in privileged contexts without any escaping which allows remote code execution for any user who has edit access on at least one document which could be the user's own profile where edit access is enabled by default. A mitigation for this vulnerability is part of XWiki 14.10.2 and XWiki 15.0 RC1: translations with user scope now require script right. This means that regular users cannot exploit this anymore as users don't have script right by default anymore starting with XWiki 14.10. There are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a patched versions.", "datePublished": "2023-04-18T23:42:44", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:07:46", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-4v38-964c-xjmw", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29510", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d06ff8a58480abc7f63eb1d4b8b366024d990643", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19749"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29510", "GHSA-4v38-964c-xjmw"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "949aed0a-782f-3181-84c5-5b5620ab0b20", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "< 14.10.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2a6c990a-9412-3334-b4ec-5c4bc5c73dea", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
