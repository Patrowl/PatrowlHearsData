DSA doesn't need rtnl_lock()\nto be held per se - since it's not a netdev state change that we're\nblocking, but rather, just concurrent additions/removals to a VLAN list.\nWe don't even need sleepable context - the callback of vlan_for_each()\njust schedules deferred work.\n\nThe proposed escape is to remove the dependency on vlan_for_each() and\nto open-code a non-sleepable, rtnl-free alternative to that, based on\ncopies of the VLAN list modified from .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid() and\n.ndo_vlan_rx_kill_vid().", "datePublished": "2025-12-24T15:30:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-24T15:30:40", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3948c69b3837fec2ee5a90fbc911c343199be0ac", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f9e79f31e51b7d5bf95c617540deb6cf2816a3f", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d06f925f13976ab82167c93467c70a337a0a3cda", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54149"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-54149"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "129d5383-adba-3edb-81e7-7789a066e2bf", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "2daf967a24334865e51520e55190a646dd480cd7"}, {"id": "178cc4c5-1a3d-3a36-808f-0a540227dc1b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "64fdc5f341db01200e33105265d4b8450122a82e <3f9e79f31e51b7d5bf95c617540deb6cf2816a3f"}, {"id": "44f34ea9-6d7b-3151-a47f-61c5f90bb8dc", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.5"}, {"id": "47725df8-db57-330d-8de7-cc49deec4410", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.4.4"}, {"id": "5371fed9-1e9d-32e5-8e22-4da3d9581329", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "5c377f09-1850-3454-b2a1-09aa35df0a33", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "64fdc5f341db01200e33105265d4b8450122a82e <3948c69b3837fec2ee5a90fbc911c343199be0ac"}, {"id": "9b08c38d-ad3f-3b9c-9eb3-d9bf57920dc8", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.3"}, {"id": "ecb3f7c8-b024-3ed2-a464-37a79b6ec376", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "64fdc5f341db01200e33105265d4b8450122a82e <d06f925f13976ab82167c93467c70a337a0a3cda"}, {"id": "f88ddffe-22ea-3b24-b3cf-34dd8c67410a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.3.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5f3bc539-4580-3a34-a83c-32b6966346c7", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
