When passing untrusted input to this API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even attacks leading to RCE.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or unsanitized input is passed to \"ServiceFactory.getService\", or by applying the patch from  https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210 . The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T14:42:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:08:43", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40743", "https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210", "https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/gs0qgk2mgss7zfhzdd6ftfjvm4kp7v82", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00025.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40743", "GHSA-rmqp-9w4c-gc7w"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.99, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "041bf72e-4413-380a-a4c5-2d273400a6c0", "product": {"name": "Apache Axis"}, "product_version": "0 \u22641.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36705a64-8a8d-3089-a516-2643ac1c46cd", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
