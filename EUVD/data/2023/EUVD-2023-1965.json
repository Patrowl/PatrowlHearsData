Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem.", "datePublished": "2023-07-25T20:59:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-10T17:36:20", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-59jf-3q9v-rh6g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38500", "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/commit/e3026f589fef0be8c3574ee3f0a0bfbe33d7ebdb", "https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer", "https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-002"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-38500", "GHSA-59jf-3q9v-rh6g"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ff10cfb-afdc-391e-a0ab-ac6e8c158db8", "product": {"name": "html-sanitizer"}, "product_version": "1.0.0, < 1.5.1"}, {"id": "6b5b7188-2f3c-35e8-aeed-967d38098612", "product": {"name": "html-sanitizer"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5b324ec-08b8-363f-a1ba-6957e6f8c783", "vendor": {"name": "TYPO3"}}], "isExploited": false}
