Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, when submitting a membership request, there is no character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of data. However it is unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS attack, as the paths reading back the reasons are only available to administrators. Starting in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a limit of 280 characters has been introduced for membership requests.", "datePublished": "2023-01-27T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:35:33", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/19993", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/d5745d34c20c31a221039d8913f33064433003ea", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-6xff-p329-9pgf", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/3e0cc4a5d9ef44ad902f6985d046ebb32f0a14ee"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-23616"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2f05d07c-1c03-374b-a6f5-7f6ad6eeab68", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "3.0.1 <3.0.1"}, {"id": "d99a67fb-fbc8-3b26-b615-9e5667f41088", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "3.1.0.beta1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f3ddd149-807b-3824-bcb7-cf5b8f683838", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
