Prior to version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.", "datePublished": "2023-10-25T20:49:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:14:22", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/security/advisories/GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46233", "https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/commit/421dd538b2d34e7c24a5b72cc64dc2b9167db40a", "https://github.com/brix/crypto-js", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00025.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46233", "GHSA-xwcq-pm8m-c4vf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a80c555e-1e70-3b7b-bb53-b2317f80e03b", "product": {"name": "crypto-js"}, "product_version": "< 4.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "354688a7-f280-3873-961a-85dd779e5527", "vendor": {"name": "brix"}}], "isExploited": false}
