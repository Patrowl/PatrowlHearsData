Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions, which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar, SquidexWidget, and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener takes some action based on the type of the received message. For example, when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type valueChanged, the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file, which can be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged method to register a callback function, which passes the value provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-07T19:00:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-04T15:22:43", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/security/advisories/GHSA-7q4f-fprr-5jw8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46252"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a62c337-fab9-3aa5-98f2-0f9bfde9daab", "product": {"name": "squidex"}, "product_version": "< 7.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "21985de0-78a0-348e-88af-f955cdfd952a", "vendor": {"name": "squidex"}}], "isExploited": false}
