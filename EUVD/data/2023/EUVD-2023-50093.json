Prior to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, if a user has been quoted and uses a `|` in their full name, they might be able to trigger a bug that generates a lot of duplicate content in all the posts they've been quoted by updating their full name again. Version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches contain a patch for this issue. No known workaround exists, although one can stop the \"bleeding\" by ensuring users only use alphanumeric characters in their full name field.", "datePublished": "2023-11-10T14:43:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-03T17:43:41", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-hcgf-hg2g-mw78", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/2ec25105179199cf80912bf011c18b8b870e1863", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/7d484864fe91ff79c478f57e7ddb1235d701921e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45806"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d7c99b6-46d9-3acb-ab8a-3d7de87f646e", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "3.2.0.beta0, < 3.2.0.beta3"}, {"id": "333122eb-9fb7-3301-8334-572fb9c21ec2", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "< 3.1.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d201b4d-2703-3085-8557-fdfadc23a276", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
