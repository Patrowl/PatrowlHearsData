The umask() call inside archive_write_disk_posix.c changes the umask of the whole process for a very short period of time; a race condition with another thread can lead to a permanent umask 0 setting. Such a race condition could lead to implicit directory creation with permissions 0777 (without the sticky bit), which means that any low-privileged local user can delete and rename files inside those directories.", "datePublished": "2023-05-29T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-14T17:07:29", "baseScore": 3.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AC:H/AV:L/A:N/C:L/I:L/PR:L/S:C/UI:R", "references": ["https://groups.google.com/g/libarchive-announce", "https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/1876"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30571"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7c312204-ba3f-36ba-9415-0e67de5a523d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "578ebfd7-9565-3721-aba6-cb492ebf2d63", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
