When creating a new container based on one of the Docker images listed below, the same secret key was being used by default. If the users didn't set a custom value via environment variables in the `.env` file, that key was shared across different CKAN instances, making it easy to forge authentication requests. Users overriding the default secret key in their own `.env` file are not affected by this issue. Note that the legacy images (ckan/ckan) located in the main CKAN repo are not affected by this issue. The affected images are ckan/ckan-docker, (ckan/ckan-base images), okfn/docker-ckan (openknowledge/ckan-base and openknowledge/ckan-dev images)\nkeitaroinc/docker-ckan (keitaro/ckan images).\n", "datePublished": "2023-02-03T21:07:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:20:30", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/ckan/ckan/security/advisories/GHSA-pr8j-v4c8-h62x", "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/44af0f0a148fcc0e0fbcf02fe69b7db13459a84b", "https://github.com/ckan/ckan/commit/4c22c135fa486afa13855d1cdb9765eaf418d2aa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22746"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b0b1285f-9bfb-3724-b37b-bdb4ddd08963", "product": {"name": "ckan"}, "product_version": "2.9.0, < 2.9.7"}, {"id": "c55328ad-5068-353e-8147-625b5d940b04", "product": {"name": "ckan"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7ef3eb1-e89e-365b-83c6-83f08674ec01", "vendor": {"name": "ckan"}}], "isExploited": false}
