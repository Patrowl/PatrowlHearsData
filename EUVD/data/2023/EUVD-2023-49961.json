Prior to version 0.13.0 Beta 3, there is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in any API endpoints reliant on the `/<camera_name>` base path as values provided for the path are not sanitized. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click the button/link. As the reflected values included in the URL are not sanitized or escaped, this permits execution arbitrary Javascript payloads. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-10-30T22:41:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T20:21:16", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate/security/advisories/GHSA-jjxc-m35j-p56f", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-190_Frigate/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45671"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 26.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2380edc4-f16f-35ad-ad54-50ce05d627cd", "product": {"name": "frigate"}, "product_version": "< 0.13.0-beta3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1b70ced5-676a-3e5a-afef-25651246ecce", "vendor": {"name": "blakeblackshear"}}], "isExploited": false}
