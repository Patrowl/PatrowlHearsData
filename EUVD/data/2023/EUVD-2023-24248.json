This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.", "datePublished": "2023-03-03T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:03:26", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-pi-epnm-xss-mZShH2J"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20069"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9e7b4b28-17d7-33a2-ad7a-87db1cbfbf0d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7d6bf611-3a47-391c-addf-235b9b4b7b4f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
