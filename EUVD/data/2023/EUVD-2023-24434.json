This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial availability condition, which could cause ongoing video calls to be dropped due to the invalid packets reaching the Web Bridge.", "datePublished": "2023-11-01T17:02:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T09:05:36", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cms-segfault-G6ES4Ve8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20255"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dd888fe5-c715-3d6d-ae14-e250fbcc651c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Meeting Server"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f32655c6-0166-39fe-84fa-dae13a28d1d5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
