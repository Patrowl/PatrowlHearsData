In versions 0.59.0 and prior, if a malicious user has taken over a Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged components which can, for instance, read all secrets on the cluster, or can exec into pods on other nodes. This way, a compromised node can be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having full privileged access to the whole cluster. The simplest way to exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges appear on its node. No patches are available as of time of publication. As a workaround, gatekeeper users can add a webhook which will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a node.", "datePublished": "2023-03-15T20:40:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:56:59", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/security/advisories/GHSA-cp96-jpmq-xrr2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26484", "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/9109", "https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26484", "GHSA-cp96-jpmq-xrr2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4710ae6-4a18-35da-8b72-8c17b81f6135", "product": {"name": "kubevirt"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.59.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c21fb712-f10e-3b34-90a7-05404c00567e", "vendor": {"name": "KubeVirt"}}], "isExploited": false}
