This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.", "datePublished": "2023-02-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:34:01", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-capic-csrfv-DMx6KSwV"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20011"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a26fa35-a798-3873-bba7-0a82b5a115b3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a3bede42-f036-336e-9490-6282af7e9bff", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
