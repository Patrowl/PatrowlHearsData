A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the Install assessment functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Using the install assessment functionality an attacker can feed a Tar file that contain files with paths pointing outside of the target directory (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped1.sh`). When the Install assessment form is submitted the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2023-05-26T22:44:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-15T16:29:34", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/security/advisories/GHSA-x9hj-r9q4-832c", "https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/commit/14f508484a8323eceb0cf3a128573b43eabbc80d", "https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2023-081_GHSL-2023-082_Autolab/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32676"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "149f57cd-19ac-358d-a6ed-a18a9e7844eb", "product": {"name": "Autolab"}, "product_version": "< 2.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e7126fa-c085-3fa0-99a4-e51d69d3ae37", "vendor": {"name": "autolab"}}], "isExploited": false}
