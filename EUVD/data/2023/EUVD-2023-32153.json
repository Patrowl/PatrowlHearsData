The GSQL query language provides users with the ability to write data to files on a remote TigerGraph server. The locations that a query is allowed to write to are configurable via the GSQL.FileOutputPolicy configuration setting. GSQL queries that contain UDFs can bypass this configuration setting and, as a consequence, can write to any file location to which the administrative user has access.", "datePublished": "2023-08-14T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-09T16:18:52", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://neo4j.com/security/cve-2023-28483/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28483"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ff1b0e8b-6c3c-32d9-8762-8aa89e385411", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9fb92c95-d397-3e46-b1fd-a831a9708565", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
