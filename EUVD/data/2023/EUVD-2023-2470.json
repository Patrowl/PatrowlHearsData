Version 1.4.2 added a check `if (\\strpos($filename, 'phar://') === 0)` in the `prepareOutput` function to resolve this CVE, however if the user is able to control the second parameter of the `generateFromHtml()` function of Snappy, it will then be passed as the `$filename` parameter in the `prepareOutput()` function. In the original vulnerability, a file name with a `phar://` wrapper could be sent to the `fileExists()` function, equivalent to the `file_exists()` PHP function. This allowed users to trigger a deserialization on arbitrary PHAR files. To fix this issue, the string is now passed to the `strpos()` function and if it starts with `phar://`, an exception is raised. However, PHP wrappers being case insensitive, this patch can be bypassed using `PHAR://` instead of `phar://`. A successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code and accessing the underlying filesystem. The attacker must be able to upload a file and the server must be running a PHP version prior to 8. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3b742d61a` which has been included in version 1.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted users may submit data to the `AbstractGenerator->generate(...)` function.\n", "datePublished": "2023-09-06T17:33:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-30T15:54:18", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-92rv-4j2h-8mjj", "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/security/advisories/GHSA-gq6w-q6wh-jggc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41330", "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy/commit/d3b742d61a68bf93866032c2c0a7f1486128b67e", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/knplabs/knp-snappy/CVE-2023-41330.yaml", "https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-92rv-4j2h-8mjj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41330", "GHSA-92rv-4j2h-8mjj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d5fbd6c0-2201-379b-aeda-a5bf9ca57322", "product": {"name": "snappy"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f0ede9d-8e32-34f2-af8a-89a3109f980f", "vendor": {"name": "KnpLabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
