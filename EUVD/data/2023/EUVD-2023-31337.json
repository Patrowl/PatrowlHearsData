Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, sending a malformed `Via` header to OpenSIPS triggers a segmentation fault when the function `calc_tag_suffix` is called. A specially crafted `Via` header, which is deemed correct by the parser, will pass uninitialized strings to the function `MD5StringArray` which leads to the crash. Abuse of this vulnerability leads to Denial of Service due to a crash. Since the uninitialized string points to memory location `0x0`, no further exploitation appears to be possible. No special network privileges are required to perform this attack, as long as the OpenSIPS configuration makes use of functions such as `sl_send_reply` or `sl_gen_totag` that trigger the vulnerable code. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.", "datePublished": "2023-03-15T20:29:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:57:06", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-wxfg-3gwh-rhvx", "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/ab611f74f69d9c42be5401c40d56ea06a58f5dd7", "https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27598"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "87d59658-c6ae-33de-b2f5-35bc83fdaa09", "product": {"name": "opensips"}, "product_version": "3.2.0, < 3.2.4"}, {"id": "e736af72-019d-3cb2-a1ce-7f34c5213531", "product": {"name": "opensips"}, "product_version": "< 3.1.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa332cfc-1560-3237-b2cb-bb17d2465494", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSIPS"}}], "isExploited": false}
