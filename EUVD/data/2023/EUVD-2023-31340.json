Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line` function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a line feed (i.e. `\\n`).\n\nThe vulnerability was found while performing black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and `codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\\n`):\n\nBy abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function, resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4.", "datePublished": "2023-03-15T21:32:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:56:36", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "https://opensips.org/docs/modules/3.3.x/sipmsgops.html", "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-xj5x-g52f-548h", "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/8f87c7c03da55f9c79bd92e67fa2c94b2a7ce5cf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27601"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a821d03c-905e-3b22-bab4-24d6cfeab84d", "product": {"name": "opensips"}, "product_version": "< 3.1.7"}, {"id": "c9299840-f9f7-33d5-a68d-e79259897b04", "product": {"name": "opensips"}, "product_version": "3.2.0, < 3.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b7b17f8d-3649-3f4c-a4fb-fe8492d647eb", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSIPS"}}], "isExploited": false}
