This is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer package depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js into the database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render such content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads.", "datePublished": "2023-08-25T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-02T17:52:37", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/security/advisories/GHSA-3x59-vrmc-5mx6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41167", "https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/commit/8748bc53fe862bb03d4459ccc0be39084a5d35c0", "https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js", "https://webiny.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41167", "GHSA-3x59-vrmc-5mx6"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ae9395f9-4d9a-379e-a223-eeb7b4967720", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd0834c2-78f4-38ef-971f-34193ee51f80", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
