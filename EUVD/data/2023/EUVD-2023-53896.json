An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stick containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the \"/boot/\" file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. This issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.", "datePublished": "2024-01-15T11:10:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T19:52:00", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/15/3", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0437", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0456", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0468", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4001", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2224951", "https://dfir.ru/2024/01/15/cve-2023-4001-a-vulnerability-in-the-downstream-grub-boot-manager/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3OBADMKHQLJOBA32Q7XPNSYMVHVAFDCB/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CHLZQ47HM64NDOHMHYO7VIJFYD5ZPPYN/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-4001"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "622e1204-e7bf-3aa5-ab10-cb420f6242c7", "product": {"name": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"}, "product_version": "patch: 1:2.06-70.el9_3.2"}, {"id": "74472069-6a88-3597-a013-66e4e348ca1e", "product": {"name": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 Extended Update Support"}, "product_version": "patch: 1:2.06-61.el9_2.2"}, {"id": "e48ddf96-615c-3c3d-ac40-5151e01dc27a", "product": {"name": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 Extended Update Support"}, "product_version": "patch: 1:2.06-27.el9_0.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ce958de-0a7a-3ce1-9143-0696d42a7958", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
