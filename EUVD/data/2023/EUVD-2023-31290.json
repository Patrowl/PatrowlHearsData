Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However, certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT, CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER, CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC, and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks, causing them to match too easily. This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2023-03-30T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-09T14:47:57", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/1892780", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230420-0010/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00025.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36NBD5YLJXXEDZLDGNFCERWRYJQ6LAQW/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27535"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "51127c6d-976f-3176-bc26-53b9fe928661", "product": {"name": "https://github.com/curl/curl"}, "product_version": "Fixed in 8.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67792556-7af4-363b-9425-786d19092d6a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
