Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.2 which resolves this issue. The messages recorded in the log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package policy objects which can contain private keys, bearer token, and sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers, client secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may occur in any Kibana instance running an affected version that could potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating to Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error logs. It could also occur under specific circumstances when debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It was found that the fix for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.\n", "datePublished": "2023-12-13T07:02:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T20:53:20", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://discuss.elastic.co/t/kibana-8-11-2-7-17-16-security-update-esa-2023-27/349182/2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46675"], "assigner": "elastic", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "20a361c4-0c95-348f-ab1c-8912c879b962", "product": {"name": "Kibana"}, "product_version": "7.13.0 <7.17.16"}, {"id": "7124e046-bcee-39da-915b-0df0325f322f", "product": {"name": "Kibana"}, "product_version": "8.0.0 <8.11.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ad880f68-ec5e-3db3-aaff-d631768dfdd9", "vendor": {"name": "Elastic"}}], "isExploited": false}
