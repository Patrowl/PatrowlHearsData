We had noticed that on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS on boot command line.\n\nThis happened because when plain IBRS was enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP protects.", "datePublished": "2023-04-21T14:51:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:39:44", "baseScore": 5.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-mj4w-6495-6crx", "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6921ed9049bc7457f66c1596c5b78aec0dae4a9d", "https://kernel.dance/#6921ed9049bc7457f66c1596c5b78aec0dae4a9d", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1998"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "719131ae-0835-3664-8968-87e42685698a", "product": {"name": "Linux kernel"}, "product_version": "0 <6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bcf479e4-1012-377f-ac0e-5ffc2c10e567", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
