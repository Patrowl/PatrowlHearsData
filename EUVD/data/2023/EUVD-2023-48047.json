Improper escaping of event titles could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.", "datePublished": "2023-10-16T21:28:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T15:48:22", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/security/advisories/GHSA-3fwj-f6ww-7hr6", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-calendar/commit/9788310906febb36822d6823d14f1059c39644de", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-43658"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db87d4b5-ba3a-30ad-8801-1107b7cd1c9e", "product": {"name": "discourse-calendar"}, "product_version": "< 97883109"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "27502852-63ba-3b69-b019-58ecb6631072", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
