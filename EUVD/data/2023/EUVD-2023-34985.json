In affected versions a user logged as an administrator can call arbitrary methods on the `SiteSetting` class, notably `#clear_cache!` and `#notify_changed!`, which when done on a multisite instance, can affect the entire cluster resulting in a denial of service. Users not running in multisite environments are not affected. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-04-18T21:36:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:28:51", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-jj93-w3mv-3jvv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30606"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b79a05f1-7d16-34f0-a546-78c4b89b236e", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "stable: < 3.0.2"}, {"id": "e37635c2-1499-3a85-ae6d-38cdb352d72a", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "beta: < 3.1.0.beta3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4cca1474-fb9c-35b5-be83-c445215ff5ee", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
