Before versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18, when importing an OCI image, there was no limit on the number of bytes read for certain files. A maliciously crafted image with a large file where a limit was not applied could cause a denial of service. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.18 and 1.5.18.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.", "datePublished": "2023-02-16T14:09:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:18:35", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25153", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/0c314901076a74a7b797a545d2f462285fdbb8c4", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.18", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.6.18", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1573", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25153.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25153", "GHSA-259w-8hf6-59c2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "034e284f-50e4-3812-a97e-ae431b625d69", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "< 1.5.18"}, {"id": "225a4d6a-0a09-35f6-87ae-9991b8b2626b", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "1.6.0, < 1.6.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9e1ae50c-0015-3a66-ac85-b9738b584083", "vendor": {"name": "containerd"}}], "isExploited": false}
