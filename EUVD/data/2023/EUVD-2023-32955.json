Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat /etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account.", "datePublished": "2023-04-14T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T19:28:12", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687", "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d", "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797", "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29383", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00026.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29383"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58301c72-8165-336f-ae96-c649c085b932", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7fc64730-992e-3cd1-b6e6-6a086c74fdd6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
