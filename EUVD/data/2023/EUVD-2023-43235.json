Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `host.php` is used to monitor and manage hosts in the _cacti_ app, hence displays useful information such as data queries and verbose logs. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a data-query template with malicious code appended in the template path, in order to deploy a stored XSS attack against any user with the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ privileges. A user that possesses the _Template Editor>Data Queries_ permissions can configure the data query template path in _cacti_. Please note that such a user may be a low privileged user. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_queries.php` by editing an existing or adding a new data query template. If a template is linked to a device then the formatted template path will be rendered in the device's management page, when a _verbose data query_ is requested. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T20:15:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:03:10", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-9fj7-8f2j-2rw2", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00018.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39513"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ab74eab-48af-32a2-8093-94dbd8c7cd2e", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2380b39e-8501-3b14-80e5-deb5e5b87dd6", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
