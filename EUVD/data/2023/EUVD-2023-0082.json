A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. As of time of publication, no patched version is available.", "datePublished": "2023-09-16T12:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-09-20T08:25:44", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p", "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/security/advisories/GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42439", "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/commit/79ac6e70419c2e0261548bed91c159b54ff35b8d", "https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode/releases/tag/4.1.3", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/geonode/PYSEC-2023-176.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-42439", "GHSA-pxg5-h34r-7q8p", "PYSEC-2023-176"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d8eecd8e-b3cb-358c-a036-4a569ec13142", "product": {"name": "geonode"}, "product_version": "3.2.0, \u2264 4.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "20f336a9-bc85-33a1-a386-da343050b7c9", "vendor": {"name": "GeoNode"}}], "isExploited": false}
