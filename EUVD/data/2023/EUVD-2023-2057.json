The Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit a weakness in the connector template upload feature to upload a malicious zip bomb file, resulting in resource exhaustion and service unavailability for all users of the Fides webserver. This vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading. If an attack occurs, the impact can be mitigated by manually or automatically restarting the affected container.\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-18T18:19:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T17:22:39", "baseScore": 2.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-g95c-2jgm-hqc6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37480", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/5aea738463960d81821c11ae7ade1d627a46bf32", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides", "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.16.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37480", "GHSA-g95c-2jgm-hqc6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e4dbc44d-a49e-37ec-aa04-d44221202945", "product": {"name": "fides"}, "product_version": "2.11.0, < 2.16.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4d72266f-b09f-3bda-a21b-461a7f9093ac", "vendor": {"name": "ethyca"}}], "isExploited": false}
