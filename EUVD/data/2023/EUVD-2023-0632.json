The v0.38.0 release of `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements for the `http.server.request_content_length`, `http.server.response_content_length`, and `http.server.duration` instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target` attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not \"forget\" previous measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly correlated with the unique URIs handled. If the query string is constantly random, this will result in a constant increase in memory allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue has been addressed in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-02-08T19:21:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:18:35", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib/security/advisories/GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25151", "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib", "https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/v1.12.0/semconv/internal/v2/http.go#L159"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25151", "GHSA-5r5m-65gx-7vrh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22460585-68d5-3cc7-8e29-9344f8c1be08", "product": {"name": "opentelemetry-go-contrib"}, "product_version": "0.38.0, < 0.39.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a7a7c453-653a-3dc9-b7c4-a7c4733914ec", "vendor": {"name": "open-telemetry"}}], "isExploited": false}
