Starting in version 4.0.0` and prior to version 4.4.1, this action uses the `github.head_ref` parameter in an insecure way. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user on GitHub on any workflow using the action on pull requests. They just need to create a pull request with a branch name, which can contain the attack payload. This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners and to exfiltrate any secrets one uses in the CI pipeline. A patched action is available in version 4.4.1. No workaround is available.", "datePublished": "2023-03-13T20:19:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:58:17", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/security/advisories/GHSA-6q4m-7476-932w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27581", "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/commit/102b1a064a9b145e56556e22b18b19c624538d94", "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action", "https://github.com/rlespinasse/github-slug-action/releases/tag/v4.4.1", "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input", "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27581", "GHSA-6q4m-7476-932w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eaee01c6-fe79-3ed9-835d-fac22906db42", "product": {"name": "github-slug-action"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 4.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "33528ea6-a094-30c5-a5c7-3bb2d50d56ec", "vendor": {"name": "rlespinasse"}}], "isExploited": false}
