To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be a member of the admin group.\r\n\r This vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly validated when NETCONF is used to upload packages to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted package file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write crafted files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem or delete arbitrary files from the filesystem of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition. \r\n\r Note: By default, during install, Cisco NSO will be set up to run as the root user unless the --run-as-user option is used.", "datePublished": "2023-01-19T01:37:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:57:35", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nso-path-trvsl-zjBeMkZg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20040"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.97, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6533a500-fe37-3d95-82ff-605e15536a5a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Network Services Orchestrator"}, "product_version": "4.7.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8cf299f8-aa74-306f-8700-4fdaf5950770", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
