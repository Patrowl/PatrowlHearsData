This function returns information based on whether the serial number of a device has already been claimed, the MAC address of a device has already been claimed, or whether the attempt to claim a device was successful. An attacker could exploit this to create a list of the serial numbers and MAC addresses of all devices cloud-connected to the Remote Management System.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-05-22T14:45:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-16T21:35:08", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-131-08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32346"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "48c14867-dec7-38bb-9dae-a47da87e48e8", "product": {"name": "Remote Management System"}, "product_version": "0 <4.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd806d1a-8909-3831-b5d3-dd830df911b4", "vendor": {"name": "Teltonika"}}], "isExploited": false}
