Based on the previous CVE-2023-0597, the 'Randomize per-cpu entry area' feature was implemented in /arch/x86/mm/cpu_entry_area.c, which works through the init_cea_offsets() function when KASLR is enabled. However, despite this feature, there is still a risk of per-cpu entry area leaks. This issue could allow a local user to gain access to some important data with memory in an expected location and potentially escalate their privileges on the system.", "datePublished": "2023-07-24T15:19:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T14:20:58", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-3640", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2217523", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3640", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:6583"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-3640"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "04020d21-f00a-3fce-ac1a-024b60736767", "product": {"name": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"}, "product_version": "patch: 0:5.14.0-362.8.1.el9_3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bdd2614c-9dcd-30d8-bfb9-7c8a69f6e3c3", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
