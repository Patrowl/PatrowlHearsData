An uncaught exception vulnerability was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package. Older versions are not impacted. A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io` package, including those who use depending packages like `socket.io`. This issue was fixed in version 6.4.2 of Engine.IO. There is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T20:21:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:49:44", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31125", "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/commit/fc480b4f305e16fe5972cf337d055e598372dc44", "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io", "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/6.4.2", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230622-0002", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230622-0002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31125", "GHSA-q9mw-68c2-j6m5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c77601e-0b57-381a-83aa-2212472b47f5", "product": {"name": "engine.io"}, "product_version": "5.1.0, < 6.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "77b87477-47cf-3bc7-ae91-4392a4e43f6b", "vendor": {"name": "socketio"}}], "isExploited": false}
