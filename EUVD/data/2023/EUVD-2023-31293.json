However, two SSH settings were omitted from the configuration check, allowing them to match easily, potentially leading to the reuse of an inappropriate connection.", "datePublished": "2023-03-30T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-09T14:52:08", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/1898475", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230420-0010/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00025.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27538"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f19064a0-5842-3102-9b47-8d802e3bfa53", "product": {"name": "https://github.com/curl/curl"}, "product_version": "Fixed in 8.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9794f091-5e84-3219-a904-534afdcfbd31", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
