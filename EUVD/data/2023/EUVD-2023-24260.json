This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DHCPv6 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCPv6 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to either control the DHCPv6 server or be in a man-in-the-middle position.", "datePublished": "2023-03-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:02:26", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftdios-dhcpv6-cli-Zf3zTv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20081"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ccb6509e-0411-3e1e-8f38-5b644b77017b", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a8cc4919-d8c3-3345-905c-c7c08410438a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
