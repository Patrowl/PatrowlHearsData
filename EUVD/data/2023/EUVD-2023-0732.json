{"id": "EUVD-2023-0732", "enisaUuid": "29bb89e4-2fbf-37ab-911a-0fc0420ebe1c", "description": "syft is a a CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. A password disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the `syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`)  during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This vulnerability affects users running syft that have the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials (regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way `cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2023-02-07T00:07:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:03:19", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/anchore/syft/security/advisories/GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24827", "https://github.com/anchore/syft/commit/9995950c70e849f9921919faffbfcf46401f71f3", "https://github.com/anchore/syft", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-24827.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-24827", "GHSA-jp7v-3587-2956"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "47ce9857-b356-3225-b2e9-9401be1d47ca", "product": {"name": "syft"}, "product_version": "0.69.0, < 0.70.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0612682f-bde9-3c3e-ae1d-7baafd971dcc", "vendor": {"name": "anchore"}}], "isExploited": false}
