Prior to version 1.2.0, memory corruption can be triggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The variable `outlen` was not initialized and could cause writing a zero to an arbitrary place in memory if `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which would leave `outlen` uninitialized. This can lead to a denial of service if the write hits unmapped memory or randomly corrupts a byte in the application memory space. This vulnerability can trigger an out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point. This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.", "datePublished": "2023-02-14T17:35:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:25:19", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25564.html", "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-r85x-q5px-9xfq", "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/c753000eb31835c0664e528fbc99378ae0cbe950", "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25564"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66388ea1-f52a-304c-b8f6-928909a5c28b", "product": {"name": "gss-ntlmssp"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c199d465-4dab-34a7-8649-3f6d9911d026", "vendor": {"name": "gssapi"}}], "isExploited": false}
