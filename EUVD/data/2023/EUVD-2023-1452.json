In rare deployment cases (error thrown by the Read()\u00a0function), this could lead to a predictable shared secret.\n\nThe tkn20 and blindrsa components did not check whether enough randomness was returned from the user provided randomness source. Typically the user provides crypto/rand.Reader, which in the vast majority of cases will always return the right number random bytes. In the cases where it does not, or the user provides a source that does not, the blinding for blindrsa is weak and integrity of the plaintext is not ensured in tkn20.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-05-10T11:41:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-27T18:32:25", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/security/advisories/GHSA-2q89-485c-9j2x", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1732", "https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/commit/ff8d91225f8954b4970b6d6382d2e4c78f4a4cf8", "https://github.com/cloudflare/circl", "https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/releases/tag/v1.3.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1732", "GHSA-2q89-485c-9j2x"], "assigner": "cloudflare", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "080f1cac-3ea6-38c5-9eea-67cf6bb47b9c", "product": {"name": "CIRCL"}, "product_version": "0 <<1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16144afe-02bb-3cd4-ac93-ad5391feddfa", "vendor": {"name": "Cloudflare"}}], "isExploited": false}
