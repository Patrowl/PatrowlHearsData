The vulnerability arises out of a failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape archives).\u00a0The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker can specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product.\u00a0This issue was fixed as part of BNSF-36456 patch. This patch was automatically applied to all customer appliances.", "datePublished": "2023-05-24T18:00:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-21T23:05:47", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://www.barracuda.com/company/legal/esg-vulnerability", "https://status.barracuda.com/incidents/34kx82j5n4q9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2868", "https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2023-2868"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-2868"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 90.3, "exploitedSince": "2023-05-26T00:00:00", "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d20d5033-8f42-32bc-b540-96328fc8e1a2", "product": {"name": "Barracuda Email Security Gateway"}, "product_version": "5.1.3.001 <9.2.0.006"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d24d8cbb-19f0-3ee9-81eb-cfd867b7fa30", "vendor": {"name": "Barracuda"}}], "isExploited": true}
