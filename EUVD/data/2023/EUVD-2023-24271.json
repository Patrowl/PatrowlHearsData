An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have a remote support user account.\r\nNote: CVE-2023-20092 does not affect Cisco DX70, DX80, TelePresence MX Series, or TelePresence SX Series devices.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
