Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.", "datePublished": "2023-11-01T19:09:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:14:32", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-73m6-jm96-c6r3", "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/b70f864940225dfe69f9f653f948e787f99c3810", "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2023_4.patch", "http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v6/SQUID-2023_4.patch", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231208-0001/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MEV66D3PAAY6K7TWDT3WZBLCPLASFJDC/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/A5QASTMCUSUEW3UOMKHZJB3FTONWSRXS/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46724"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fd4eb49-a075-33c2-b04f-7972ad90f24a", "product": {"name": "squid"}, "product_version": "3.3.0.1, < 6.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11e51b41-8e17-3631-aebd-c205b316d069", "vendor": {"name": "squid-cache"}}], "isExploited": false}
