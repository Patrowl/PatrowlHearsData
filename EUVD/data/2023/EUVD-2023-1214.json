An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants using matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-sdk users, the attacker will not appear to be participating in the call. This attack is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call implementation accepts incoming direct calls from other users, even if they have not yet declared intent to participate in the group call, as a means of resolving a race condition in call setup. Affected versions do not restrict access to the user's outbound media in this case. Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 24.1.0. As a workaround, users may hold group calls in private rooms where only the exact users who are expected to participate in the call are present.", "datePublished": "2023-04-14T18:21:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:14:38", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-6g67-q39g-r79q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29529", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk", "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v24.1.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29529", "GHSA-6g67-q39g-r79q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7b2251b3-c948-3056-b4a2-e826914c1966", "product": {"name": "matrix-js-sdk"}, "product_version": "< 24.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b915d74-7671-311e-84d3-e4dfdb522d73", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
