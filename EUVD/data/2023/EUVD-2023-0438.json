Encoding data which contains a Bytes kind Node will pass a Bytes token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect to receive Bytes tokens. Such an encode should be treated as an error, as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes. This only impacts uses of the `json` codec. `dag-json` is not impacted. Use of `json` as a decoder is not impacted. This issue is fixed in v0.19.0. As a workaround, one may prefer the `dag-json` codec, which has the ability to encode bytes.", "datePublished": "2023-01-04T14:53:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:13:48", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/security/advisories/GHSA-c653-6hhg-9x92", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22460", "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/pull/472", "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/commit/146d1c8529676fe9ee0604f014656af2395505fc", "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime", "https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/releases/tag/v0.19.0", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1269"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22460", "GHSA-c653-6hhg-9x92"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cb522fb2-ff4e-399a-9f26-28259b0fb857", "product": {"name": "go-ipld-prime"}, "product_version": "< 0.19.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a0283aca-7a17-379a-8e63-4e4858ff42ce", "vendor": {"name": "ipld"}}], "isExploited": false}
