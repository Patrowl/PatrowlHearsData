WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock\u2019s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations.", "datePublished": "2023-09-06T20:38:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-26T15:51:46", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-hq8w-9w8w-pmx7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41327", "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock", "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/2.35.1", "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta-15", "https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/3.0.3", "https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41327", "GHSA-hq8w-9w8w-pmx7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8442d21e-e08c-323c-8f5e-87ad006b5433", "product": {"name": "wiremock"}, "product_version": "org.wiremock:wiremock-webhooks-extension:  3.0.0, < 3.0.3"}, {"id": "c7904139-d3a3-37d4-a1be-4e63f74e7792", "product": {"name": "wiremock"}, "product_version": "wiremock-studio: All versions"}, {"id": "e1d69ac3-9c13-3eed-91f9-7e2ca7493133", "product": {"name": "wiremock"}, "product_version": "org.wiremock:wiremock-webhooks-extension:  2.0.0, < 2.35.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "37414dae-4b06-3f55-bd83-940276d1e5b6", "vendor": {"name": "wiremock"}}], "isExploited": false}
