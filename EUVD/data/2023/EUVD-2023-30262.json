An attacker with access to a local or restricted network with the capability to intercept and replay HTTP requests to sproxyd (or who is in control of the sproxyd service) could perform a server-side request-forgery attack and make Cacheservice connect to unexpected resources. We have disabled the ability to follow HTTP redirects when connecting to sproxyd resources. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-08-02T12:23:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-03T15:04:38", "baseScore": 3.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6230_7.10.6_2023-05-02.pdf", "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0003.json", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Aug/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173943/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-SQL-Injection-Cross-Site-Scripting.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26442"], "assigner": "OX", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fc71bba0-ad97-39ca-9577-d9b17c045730", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22648.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9eb33a1-8530-3511-a60b-0f3187144644", "vendor": {"name": "OX Software GmbH"}}], "isExploited": false}
