Note that getting the JavaScript to execute requires user interaction as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form entry id, but the script itself is stored in the site database.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T05:33:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-20T23:37:25", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ae7549db-9a4b-4dee-8023-d7863dc3b4c8?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/metform/trunk/base/shortcode.php?rev=2845078", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2907471/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0708"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a0606a80-c948-3eb1-ad28-e5d250896dad", "product": {"name": "Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder \u2013 Flexible and Design-Friendly Contact Form builder plugin for WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ad6f5c4a-3c68-3051-921a-60bd8debdcac", "vendor": {"name": "xpeedstudio"}}], "isExploited": false}
