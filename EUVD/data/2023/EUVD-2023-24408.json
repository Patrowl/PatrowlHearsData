An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a directory traversal attack on an affected host. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to use a cryptographic key to overwrite arbitrary files with SYSTEM-level privileges, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or data loss on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2023-08-16T21:43:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T21:42:24", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-duo-dha-filewrite-xPMBMZAK"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20229"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4c4746ad-defa-34fd-8b1b-cef6bbd19808", "product": {"name": "Cisco Duo Device Health Application"}, "product_version": "5.1.0.0"}, {"id": "d94d3fc0-7d54-3ad4-bc91-df5d6e0431c3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Duo Device Health Application"}, "product_version": "5.0.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cb11eaa1-3a7b-36a0-8b65-3aeb2f5a070f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
