The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.", "datePublished": "2023-06-22T13:29:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-05T17:48:07", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35926", "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fb7375507d56faedcb7bb3665480070593c8949a", "https://github.com/backstage/backstage", "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.15.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-35926", "GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "348da87c-68fe-33b7-a2f0-02dd770f2de2", "product": {"name": "backstage"}, "product_version": "< 1.15.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a4c9af8-ea3d-3643-b48c-a5725b142e53", "vendor": {"name": "backstage"}}], "isExploited": false}
