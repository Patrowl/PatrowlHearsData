{"id": "EUVD-2023-36939", "enisaUuid": "d0bffbc1-2952-3f8b-85e1-e75660bea9bc", "description": "In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.1.0.2, 9.0.5.1, and 8.2.11.2, an attacker can inject American National Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into Splunk log files that, when a vulnerable terminal application reads them, can potentially, at worst, result in possible code execution in the vulnerable application. This attack requires a user to use a terminal application that supports the translation of ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable terminal, and to perform additional user interaction to exploit.\nUniversal Forwarder versions 9.1.0.1, 9.0.5, 8.2.11, and lower can be vulnerable in situations where they have management services active and accessible over the network. Universal Forwarder versions 9.0.x and 9.1.x bind management services to the local machine and are not vulnerable in this specific configuration. See SVD-2022-0605 for more information. Universal Forwarder versions 9.1 use Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for communication, which further reduces the potential attack surface.\nThe vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk Enterprise or Universal Forwarder. The indirect impact on Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder can vary significantly depending on the permissions in the vulnerable terminal application and where and how the user reads the malicious log file. For example, users can copy the malicious file from the Splunk Enterprise instance and read it on their local machine.", "datePublished": "2023-06-01T16:34:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-28T11:03:57", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2023-0606", "https://research.splunk.com/application/de3908dc-1298-446d-84b9-fa81d37e959b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32712"], "assigner": "Splunk", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "06e4dc1e-ca2f-3837-83d3-58ae1defe6df", "product": {"name": "Universal Forwarder"}, "product_version": "9.1 <9.1.1"}, {"id": "209fc074-fc9c-38af-88c9-97775629276c", "product": {"name": "Universal Forwarder"}, "product_version": "9.0 <9.0.6"}, {"id": "315e6b12-20fb-3007-818e-023c7547a6e7", "product": {"name": "Splunk Enterprise"}, "product_version": "8.2 <8.2.11.2"}, {"id": "3b69e3dc-1900-30fb-a2db-7c169c69b5f2", "product": {"name": "Splunk Enterprise"}, "product_version": "9.1 <9.1.0.2"}, {"id": "8de42256-4c47-3680-91f1-24908394cb8e", "product": {"name": "Universal Forwarder"}, "product_version": "8.2 <8.2.12"}, {"id": "d0f2e974-4000-3cf2-9c50-f43c344a59e6", "product": {"name": "Splunk Enterprise"}, "product_version": "9.0 <9.0.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8cb4f842-5d61-3264-917d-ea40c257cb1a", "vendor": {"name": "Splunk"}}], "isExploited": false}
