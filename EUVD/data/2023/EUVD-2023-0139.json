A malicious user on a Synapse homeserver X with permission to create certain state events can disable outbound federation from X to an arbitrary homeserver Y. Synapse instances with federation disabled are not affected. In versions of Synapse up to and including 1.73, Synapse did not limit the size of `invite_room_state`, meaning that it was possible to create an arbitrarily large invite event. Synapse 1.74 refuses to create oversized `invite_room_state` fields. Server operators should upgrade to Synapse 1.74 or newer urgently.", "datePublished": "2023-05-26T13:32:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:50:32", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14642", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14492", "https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/14492", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32323", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/matrix-synapse/PYSEC-2023-67.yaml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UJIJRP5ZH6B3KGFLHCAKR2IX2Y4Z25QD", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UJIJRP5ZH6B3KGFLHCAKR2IX2Y4Z25QD/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32323", "GHSA-f3wc-3vxv-xmvr", "PYSEC-2023-67"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ce4bd13-94e0-39ce-b771-a3dfd5195298", "product": {"name": "synapse"}, "product_version": "< 1.74.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7d95afd-f742-3a59-828a-4ea6f5cd3014", "vendor": {"name": "matrix-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
