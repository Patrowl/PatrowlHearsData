Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems to happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.", "datePublished": "2023-05-11T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-05T01:13:02", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/3de1415ee77a9244eb04bdb695e249d3ec9ed868", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32058", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/vyper/PYSEC-2023-78.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32058", "GHSA-6r8q-pfpv-7cgj", "PYSEC-2023-78"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9943afb-6b93-3cf1-ae05-ea35d958561f", "product": {"name": "vyper"}, "product_version": "< 0.3.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1f911ae2-5c19-35ad-8249-4d68394083fc", "vendor": {"name": "vyperlang"}}], "isExploited": false}
