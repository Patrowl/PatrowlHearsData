{"id": "EUVD-2023-2828", "enisaUuid": "ba9ce892-314e-37f0-bb56-2797d0460aa5", "description": "Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions 11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through 9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for HTTP/2 HPACK header values to\nexceed their size limit. `MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded. However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the multiplication by 4 in line 295\nwill overflow, and length will become negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line 296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative, potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2, then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and 9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-10-10T16:53:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:56:19", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-wgh7-54f2-x98r", "https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-wgh7-54f2-x98r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36478", "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9634", "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project", "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases/tag/jetty-10.0.16", "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases/tag/jetty-11.0.16", "https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/releases/tag/jetty-9.4.53.v20231009", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00045.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231116-0011", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5540", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/18/4", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231116-0011/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-36478", "GHSA-wgh7-54f2-x98r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fe9040f-55e8-3012-b2df-778451e898d1", "product": {"name": "jetty.project"}, "product_version": "9.3.0, < 9.4.53"}, {"id": "a64fb862-9838-338e-8f6d-50cd947c6248", "product": {"name": "jetty.project"}, "product_version": "10.0.0, < 10.0.16"}, {"id": "e1da6ebe-9ea6-3042-808c-30a18250fd0d", "product": {"name": "jetty.project"}, "product_version": "11.0.0, < 11.0.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "858e2734-fdd4-37b3-b994-5c972d80decd", "vendor": {"name": "eclipse"}}], "isExploited": false}
