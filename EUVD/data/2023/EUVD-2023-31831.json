{"id": "EUVD-2023-31831", "enisaUuid": "b6dba965-0bab-3c85-a97f-c33d7caff6ec", "description": "Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for internet of things (IoT) devices. In versions 4.8 and prior, an out-of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG operating system.  The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer (packetbuf) for processing of packets, with the size of PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular, when using the BLE L2CAP module with the default configuration, the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes larger then the actual size of the packetbuf.  When large packets are processed by the L2CAP module, a buffer overflow can therefore occur when copying the packet data to the packetbuf. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying the patch manually.", "datePublished": "2023-03-17T21:22:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:53:03", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-m737-4vx6-pfqp", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2398"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28116"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4df314e8-f445-3863-b358-354770ab0dcc", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a186f53-4ad8-376f-b88b-1bb79129def3", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
