Unlike a standalone dedicated Collabora Online server, the Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) is run without chroot sandboxing. Vulnerable versions of the richdocumentscode app can be susceptible to attack via modified client->server commands to overwrite files outside the sub directory the server has provided for the transient session. Files which can be accessed are limited to those that the server process has access to. The bug was fixed in Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server (richdocumentscode) release 23.5.602. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-12-08T20:02:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T22:01:26", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-3r69-xvf7-v94j"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49788"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82e07fcb-fdbc-3876-8358-d562c8da7c75", "product": {"name": "online"}, "product_version": "< 23.5.602"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "35a77383-c6b0-3591-be2f-5a26456da4f4", "vendor": {"name": "CollaboraOnline"}}], "isExploited": false}
