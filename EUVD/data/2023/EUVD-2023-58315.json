The issue arises when the product blocks a connection due to an untrusted server certificate but allows the user to add the site to exceptions, resulting in the product trusting the certificate for subsequent HTTPS scans. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by using a self-signed certificate, which the product will trust after the site has been added to exceptions. This can lead to the interception and potential alteration of secure communications.", "datePublished": "2024-10-18T07:52:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T15:26:30", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.bitdefender.com/support/security-advisories/https-certificate-validation-issue-in-bitdefender-safepay-va-11167/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6058"], "assigner": "Bitdefender", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9c49f727-8d59-3059-87be-3732d6874616", "product": {"name": "Total Security"}, "product_version": "0 <27.0.25.115"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f96460b-0ee5-3324-8cac-71c017c9c186", "vendor": {"name": "Bitdefender"}}], "isExploited": false}
