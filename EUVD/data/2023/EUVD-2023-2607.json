Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when GraphQL Subscriptions are enabled.  It can be triggered when **all of the following conditions are met**: 1. Running Apollo Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 (\"impacted versions\"); **and** 2. The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink or explicitly via other configuration)\u00a0**has a `subscription` type** with root-fields defined; **and** 3. The YAML configuration provided to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are _disabled_ by default), either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a valid `mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions' documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and** 4. An [anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g., `subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router If **all four** of these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and terminate.  There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information exposure aspect to this vulnerability. This is fixed in Apollo Router v1.29.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Updating to v1.29.1 should be a clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions.  However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph \u2013 but are enabled via configuration \u2014 then disabling subscriptions is another option to mitigate the risk.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T18:31:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-30T19:17:12", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41317", "https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/b295c103dd86c57c848397d32e8094edfa8502aa", "https://github.com/apollographql/router", "https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v1.29.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41317", "GHSA-w8vq-3hf9-xppx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "318d8145-f5df-3c45-9fc2-2e71be8f8f51", "product": {"name": "Router"}, "product_version": "1.28.0, < 1.29.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11a42b85-cd61-339c-beca-82a10b727067", "vendor": {"name": "apollographql"}}], "isExploited": false}
