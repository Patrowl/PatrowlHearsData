The proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals with a `signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried through `getActions` appear to respect the original intended calldata. This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As a workaround, ensure that all proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures` and `calldatas` parameters.", "datePublished": "2023-04-16T07:10:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:28:51", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/security/advisories/GHSA-93hq-5wgc-jc82", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30542", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/8d633cb7d169f2f8595b273660b00b69e845c2fe", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts", "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/releases/tag/v4.8.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30542", "GHSA-93hq-5wgc-jc82"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e51b4fb7-9b44-39db-8c75-09cf66f628da", "product": {"name": "openzeppelin-contracts"}, "product_version": "4.3.0, < 4.8.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "85572c07-7094-3088-b44c-bc77994b98cf", "vendor": {"name": "OpenZeppelin"}}], "isExploited": false}
