In version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an abnormal program termination.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the `decomp_get_rddata` function within the `Decompress.c` file. When handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata`, the result of the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative number `len = rdlength - total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes` function without proper validation, causing the program to attempt to allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible to allocate. Consequently, the program exits with an error code of 64, causing a Denial of Service.\n\nOne proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch `Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.", "datePublished": "2023-05-09T13:56:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:49:46", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/security/advisories/GHSA-58m7-826v-9c3c", "https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/commit/bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58", "https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/blob/08b21ea20d80cedcb74aa8f14979ec7c61846663/dns/Decompress.c#L886", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NB7LDZM5AGWC5BHHQHW6CP5OFNBBKFOQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3VSMLJX25MXGQ6A7UPOGK7VPUVDESPHL/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00019.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5441"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31137"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.86, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb32de49-8add-348d-bb63-c7ad5502736d", "product": {"name": "MaraDNS"}, "product_version": "\u2264 3.5.0024"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c5d526d-8233-3d53-ae8c-27f433fb1e99", "vendor": {"name": "samboy"}}], "isExploited": false}
