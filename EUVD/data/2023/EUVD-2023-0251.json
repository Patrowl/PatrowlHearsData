By crafting a malicious UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g. ../../tmp/outside.txt), it's possible to force ubi_reader to write outside of the extraction directory.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects ubi-reader before 0.8.5.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-01-31T09:18:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-26T20:38:12", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://onekey.com/blog/security-advisory-remote-command-execution-in-binwalk/", "https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader/pull/57", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0591", "https://github.com/jrspruitt/ubi_reader/commit/d5d68e6b1b9f7070c29df5f67fc060f579ae9139", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/ubi-reader/PYSEC-2023-51.yaml", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-0591.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0591", "PYSEC-2023-51"], "assigner": "ONEKEY", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "95dfa6b1-4ca3-3c17-9972-776a30d67fa7", "product": {"name": "ubi_reader"}, "product_version": "0 <0.8.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de2773de-7a1d-3941-ac5e-24c56e5bec6e", "vendor": {"name": " jrspruitt"}}], "isExploited": false}
