Consequently, the MQTT broker, typically operated by a system integrator, will have no access to the drones\u2019 real RID information.\n\nThis issue affects the adjacent channel suppression algorithm present in DroneScout ds230 firmware from version 20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042.", "datePublished": "2023-07-11T08:45:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T19:37:56", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.nozominetworks.com/labs/vulnerability-advisories-cve-2023-31191/", "https://download.bluemark.io/dronescout/firmware/history.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31191"], "assigner": "Nozomi", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0759343c-638e-337f-bb1d-e65f06c0e873", "product": {"name": "ds230"}, "product_version": "20230104-1650 \u226420230329-1042"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "37093efe-11fd-315e-a268-8788dc6f390e", "vendor": {"name": "bluemark"}}], "isExploited": false}
