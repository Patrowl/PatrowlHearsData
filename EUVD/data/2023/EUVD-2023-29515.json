Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of 4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to a large, up to 65KB, out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a patch for the out-of-bounds reads.", "datePublished": "2023-02-14T17:35:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:25:19", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25563.html", "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjx-5qf7-9mgf", "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/commit/97c62c6167299028d80765080e74d91dfc99efbd", "https://github.com/gssapi/gss-ntlmssp/releases/tag/v1.2.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25563"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb8cee89-c06e-306b-8ced-aa56a0add0d9", "product": {"name": "gss-ntlmssp"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "236662a8-a4ae-341c-8116-7aa1b9138aa8", "vendor": {"name": "gssapi"}}], "isExploited": false}
