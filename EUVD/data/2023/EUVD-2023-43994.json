However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5 has no way to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the tgt provided over the network as being valid. In a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam_krb5 for authentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker that is able to control both the password and the KDC responses can return a valid tgt, allowing authentication to occur for any user on the system.\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-22T16:37:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-05T17:45:19", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-23:04.pam_krb5.asc", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230714-0005/", "https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-23:09.pam_krb5.asc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-3326"], "assigner": "freebsd", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4782d573-d898-3110-8666-d7de4c0b8ff1", "product": {"name": "FreeBSD"}, "product_version": "13.1-RELEASE <13.1-RELEASE-p8"}, {"id": "b7a589d0-400b-34eb-96c1-e78b61419c49", "product": {"name": "FreeBSD"}, "product_version": "12.4-RELEASE <12.4-RELEASE-p3"}, {"id": "d21f673c-5855-398b-ad7a-01c0574941ec", "product": {"name": "FreeBSD"}, "product_version": "13.2-RELEASE <13.2-RELEASE-p1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "df856a11-1500-365c-a54a-2bd6c2d36a8d", "vendor": {"name": "FreeBSD"}}], "isExploited": false}
