Users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a keyspace containing `/` characters such that from that point on, anyone who tries to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error. Trying to list all the keyspaces using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces` will also return an error. Note that all other keyspaces can still be administered using the CLI (vtctldclient). This issue is fixed in version 16.0.1. As a workaround, delete the offending keyspace using a CLI client (vtctldclient).", "datePublished": "2023-04-14T18:42:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:00:15", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/security/advisories/GHSA-735r-hv67-g38f", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29194", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commit/adf10196760ad0b3991a7aa7a8580a544e6ddf88", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commits/v0.16.1", "https://github.com/vitessio/vitess/commits/v0.16.1/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29194", "GHSA-735r-hv67-g38f"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "11b41e0f-ec97-3c2d-8979-350524a35052", "product": {"name": "vitess"}, "product_version": "< 0.16.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bf6e29e1-3ceb-3816-8ef1-ba7bbdf2af1a", "vendor": {"name": "vitessio"}}], "isExploited": false}
