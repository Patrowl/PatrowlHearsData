Prior to version 4.1.3, this was not called out in the documentation explicitly, so it is possible that administrators provided authorizations to configure Spark hooks without taking this into account. We recommend administrators to review their configurations to make sure the authorization to configure Spark hooks is only provided to fully trusted users.\n\nTo view the warning in the docs please visit\u00a0 https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/4.1.3/connections/spark.html \n\n", "datePublished": "2023-08-28T07:50:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T16:19:19", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread/fzy95b1d6zv31j5wrx3znhzcscck2o24", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/fzy95b1d6zv31j5wrx3znhzcscck2o24", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/33233", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40195", "https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/6850b5c777fa515e110ad1daa85242209a8ec6c0", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark/PYSEC-2023-156.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40195", "PYSEC-2023-156"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 2.6, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84d9460c-9530-3c4d-8ca0-96455d3284eb", "product": {"name": "Apache Airflow Spark Provider"}, "product_version": "0 <4.1.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7827ec7d-1625-3529-b240-1a9dc30c5f4f", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
