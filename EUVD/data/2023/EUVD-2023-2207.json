In affected versions an attacker can post malformed webhook data witch lead to an update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of an repo. This is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should secure the CI system by making it inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind a firewall.", "datePublished": "2023-08-16T20:48:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-02T19:57:12", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/security/advisories/GHSA-4gcf-5m39-98mc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40034", "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2221", "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/pull/2222", "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/commit/6e4c2f84cc84661d58cf1c0e5c421a46070bb105", "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker", "https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker/releases/tag/v1.0.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40034", "GHSA-4gcf-5m39-98mc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c3a9a188-0a91-303b-a49e-9e9015681022", "product": {"name": "woodpecker"}, "product_version": "1.0.0, < 1.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "63f561ef-a099-34bd-aec0-9aab47a5f1f7", "vendor": {"name": "woodpecker-ci"}}], "isExploited": false}
