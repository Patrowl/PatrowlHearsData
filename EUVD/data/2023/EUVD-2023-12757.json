This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_save_sort_order function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link leading them to perform actions intended for administrators such as changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T05:33:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-20T23:37:04", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ae8dbf54-ea62-4901-b34f-079b708ca0b5?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wicked-folders/tags/2.18.16/lib/class-wicked-folders-ajax.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=2860994%40wicked-folders%2Ftrunk&old=2805161%40wicked-folders%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0729"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "668fa0d9-ad9c-3ade-9361-6cfef61f3f93", "product": {"name": "Wicked Folders"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.18.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3eb06645-765f-3042-aed1-cc1490456abe", "vendor": {"name": "wickedplugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
