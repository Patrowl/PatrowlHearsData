An off-by-one error can be triggered in the Antelope database management system in the Contiki-NG operating system in versions 4.8 and prior. The problem exists in the Contiki File System (CFS) backend for the storage of data (file os/storage/antelope/storage-cfs.c). In the functions `storage_get_index` and `storage_put_index`, a buffer for merging two strings is allocated with one byte less than the maximum size of the merged strings, causing subsequent function calls to the cfs_open function to read from memory beyond the buffer size. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2425.", "datePublished": "2023-04-26T18:14:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-30T21:31:28", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-257g-w39m-5jj4", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2425"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30546"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a0b82eb2-0307-3733-b5fc-b0719a1d4eef", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5bf9dc6e-effc-32a5-a8e3-d67fc9afdd1b", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
