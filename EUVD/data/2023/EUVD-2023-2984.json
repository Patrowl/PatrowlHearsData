In affected versions successful login attempts are recorded with the raw tokens stored in the log table. If a malicious person somehow views the data in the log table they can obtain a raw token which can then be used to send a request with that user's authority. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable logging for successful login attempts by the configuration files.", "datePublished": "2023-11-24T17:16:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T21:37:54", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/security/advisories/GHSA-j72f-h752-mx4w", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48708", "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/commit/7e84c3fb3411294f70890819bfe51781bb9dc8e4", "https://codeigniter4.github.io/shield/getting_started/authenticators", "https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield", "https://codeigniter4.github.io/shield/getting_started/authenticators/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48708", "GHSA-j72f-h752-mx4w"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "24c063a3-a983-3d82-addf-bfad898a4829", "product": {"name": "shield"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0-beta.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d3df48cd-cf75-38e3-9fe2-8cc4ed4a60f4", "vendor": {"name": "codeigniter4"}}], "isExploited": false}
