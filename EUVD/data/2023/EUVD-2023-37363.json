An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered starting in version 3.2.0 and prior to version 3.3.2 in the `/display/map` API route inside the CMS. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the `bounds` parameter. Users should upgrade to version 3.3.5, which fixes this issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.", "datePublished": "2023-05-30T20:18:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-09T21:15:34", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/xibosignage/xibo-cms/security/advisories/GHSA-7ww5-x9rm-qm89", "https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard", "https://xibosignage.com/blog/security-advisory-2023-05/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-33180"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e24daead-a193-3d0b-8bd3-67c22537fb73", "product": {"name": "xibo-cms"}, "product_version": "3.2.0, < 3.3.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "31585585-ba85-3901-ae00-8c3b7e088c52", "vendor": {"name": "xibosignage"}}], "isExploited": false}
