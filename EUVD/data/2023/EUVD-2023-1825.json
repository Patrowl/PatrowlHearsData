In versions of Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp` field defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the `deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known workaround.", "datePublished": "2023-06-01T16:24:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T21:32:51", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/security/advisories/GHSA-hq4m-4948-64cc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34091", "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno", "https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/tag/v1.10.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34091", "GHSA-hq4m-4948-64cc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a7c30ee4-7feb-380e-81f3-cf73ffab2121", "product": {"name": "kyverno"}, "product_version": "< 1.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d831d6c1-38c3-3575-9c56-54ca9b473139", "vendor": {"name": "kyverno"}}], "isExploited": false}
