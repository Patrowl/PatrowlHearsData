A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server.", "datePublished": "2023-08-24T22:03:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-02T19:11:26", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker/security/advisories/GHSA-826j-8wp2-4x6q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32079", "https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32079", "GHSA-826j-8wp2-4x6q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4de941e6-bd42-3d0b-a09d-fee59a38445b", "product": {"name": "netmaker"}, "product_version": "0.18.0, < 0.18.6"}, {"id": "7412604f-f524-36ca-92d0-b3e875f3a70e", "product": {"name": "netmaker"}, "product_version": "< 0.17.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1d108e62-fc8f-374f-a201-6173df0ed0a3", "vendor": {"name": "gravitl"}}], "isExploited": false}
