It is expected that the UAA would reject a refresh token during a refresh token grant, but it does not (hence the vulnerability). It will continue to issue access tokens to request presenting such refresh tokens, as if the identity provider was still active. As a result, clients with refresh tokens issued through the deactivated identity provider would still have access to Cloud Foundry resources until their refresh token expires (which defaults to 30 days).", "datePublished": "2023-03-28T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-19T18:38:21", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2023-20903-tokens-for-inactivated-idps-are-not-revoked-and-remain-valid-until-expiration/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-20903"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20903"], "assigner": "vmware", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ea96dc56-7011-3b1a-9e08-f28d2c398fd7", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
