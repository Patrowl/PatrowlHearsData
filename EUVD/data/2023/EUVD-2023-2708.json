A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without any authentication, or perform various malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. This issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes as defense in depth measures. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-10-16T20:45:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T14:23:48", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/security/advisories/GHSA-94w9-97p3-p368", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45128", "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/8c3916dbf4ad2ed427d02c6eb63ae8b2fa8f019a", "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/b50d91d58ecdff2a330bf07950244b6c4caf65b1", "https://github.com/gofiber/fiber"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45128", "GHSA-94w9-97p3-p368"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42b4954e-b76e-38cb-a30d-c17e767daeed", "product": {"name": "fiber"}, "product_version": "< 2.50.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6bc1eeda-25de-37ef-91d0-fc3ef31d3a0a", "vendor": {"name": "gofiber"}}], "isExploited": false}
