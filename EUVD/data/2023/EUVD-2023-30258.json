Attackers that were timing DNS cache expiry correctly were able to inject configuration that would bypass existing network deny-lists. Attackers could exploit this weakness to discover the existence of restricted network infrastructure and service availability. Improvements were made to include deny-lists not only during the check of the provided connection data, but also during use. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-08-02T12:22:59", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:46:24", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6230_7.10.6_2023-05-02.pdf", "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0003.json", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Aug/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173943/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-SQL-Injection-Cross-Site-Scripting.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26438"], "assigner": "OX", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d567e23-d404-3a70-ba02-e0fcc46aae79", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22647.10.6-rev42"}, {"id": "65df37e4-cef3-3882-b6b4-5e35b80d750d", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22648.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f63013c4-3806-3a9d-8d4b-9f5c26e5f190", "vendor": {"name": "OX Software GmbH"}}], "isExploited": false}
