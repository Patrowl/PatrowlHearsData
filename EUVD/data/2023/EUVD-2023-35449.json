Prior to commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`, may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability. The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch manually.", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T20:01:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-29T15:03:56", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/security/advisories/GHSA-356r-rwp8-h6m6", "https://github.com/effectindex/tripreporter/commit/bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31123"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6d06eb68-b906-3c8b-87e3-2ba8a9abc552", "product": {"name": "tripreporter"}, "product_version": "< bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2bacc4e5-574e-3d64-ad56-bee072f7d003", "vendor": {"name": "effectindex"}}], "isExploited": false}
