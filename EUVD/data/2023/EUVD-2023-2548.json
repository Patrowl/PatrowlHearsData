The translation value with text including \u201c%s\u201d (from \u201c%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it\u2019s supposed to be output literally to the user. The translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain \u201cmodules\u201d) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box. This issue has been patched in commit `abd77392` which is included in release 1.1.2. Users are advised to update to version 1.1.2 or apply the patch manually.\n", "datePublished": "2023-09-25T18:57:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-24T14:43:34", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/security/advisories/GHSA-m988-7375-7g2c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-42817", "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c", "https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-42817", "GHSA-m988-7375-7g2c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 100.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e2cab80f-d563-3dde-a945-5314bbfcea48", "product": {"name": "admin-ui-classic-bundle"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11b29929-988a-3991-8bd1-1443f4e20b8c", "vendor": {"name": "pimcore"}}], "isExploited": false}
