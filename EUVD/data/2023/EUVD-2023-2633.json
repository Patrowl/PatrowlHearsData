Starting in version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and receiving a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions before 0.37.0 are not affected.", "datePublished": "2023-10-31T15:02:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T17:37:20", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-3q6m-v84f-6p9h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46239", "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b6a4725b60f1fe04e8f1ddcc3114e290fcea1617", "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go", "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.37.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46239", "GHSA-3q6m-v84f-6p9h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b2e42ea5-3a1e-3a9b-bc95-3da806f058ce", "product": {"name": "quic-go"}, "product_version": "0.37.0, < 0.37.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0e92ac12-a843-3c81-b725-ccc44ae46cfd", "vendor": {"name": "quic-go"}}], "isExploited": false}
