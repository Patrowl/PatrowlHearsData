The chosen value was not sufficiently sanitized before processing it at the user interface, allowing for indirect cross-site scripting attacks. Accounts that were temporarily taken over could be configured to trigger persistent code execution, allowing an attacker to build a foothold. Sanitization is in place for product names now. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-11-02T13:01:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-03T14:35:08", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6243_7.10.6_2023-08-01.pdf", "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0004.json"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26456"], "assigner": "OX", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a57ea43e-2bba-3b26-8883-2e6ab36bbac1", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22642.10.7-rev6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e26d822a-f530-314a-9627-14fb03815fa6", "vendor": {"name": "OX Software GmbH"}}], "isExploited": false}
