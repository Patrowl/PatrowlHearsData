Clickjacking is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they intend to click on the top-level page. During the pentest, it has been detected that the config-editor page is vulnerable to clickjacking. This flaw allows an attacker to trick an administrator user into clicking on buttons on the config-editor panel, possibly reconfiguring some parts of the Quay instance.", "datePublished": "2023-11-07T19:12:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-07T00:46:07", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4956", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2238886"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-4956"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "005b7f5e-3af0-387c-9423-59d26b6ebdf3", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
