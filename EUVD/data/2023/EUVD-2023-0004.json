The HTTP parser in AIOHTTP has numerous problems with header parsing, which could lead to request smuggling. This parser is only used when AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS is enabled (or not using a prebuilt wheel). These bugs have been addressed in commit `d5c12ba89` which has been included in release version 3.8.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.", "datePublished": "2023-11-14T20:48:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:36:06", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/d5c12ba890557a575c313bb3017910d7616fce3d", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47627", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/releases/tag/v3.8.6", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/aiohttp/PYSEC-2023-246.yaml", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FUSJVQ7OQ55RWL4XAX2F5EZ73N4ZSH6U", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VDKQ6HM3KNDU4OQI476ZWT4O7DMSIT35", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WQYQL6WV535EEKSNH7KRARLLMOW5WXDM", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VDKQ6HM3KNDU4OQI476ZWT4O7DMSIT35/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WQYQL6WV535EEKSNH7KRARLLMOW5WXDM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FUSJVQ7OQ55RWL4XAX2F5EZ73N4ZSH6U/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/02/msg00002.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-47627", "GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg", "PYSEC-2023-246"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "504942ed-6462-3142-b765-ff58c45396f0", "product": {"name": "aiohttp"}, "product_version": "< 3.8.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "07221095-a09c-3d4d-92d5-bde48fd70cb1", "vendor": {"name": "aio-libs"}}], "isExploited": false}
