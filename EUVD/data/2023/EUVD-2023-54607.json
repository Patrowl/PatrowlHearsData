As soon as this finds a / in the path, everything before it is removed, but potentially \\ (backslashes) coming further back are kept.\n\nFor example, a file name such as /..\\..\\webapps\\shell.war can be used to upload a file to a Tomcat server under Windows, which is then saved as ..\\..\\webapps\\shell.war in its webapps directory and can then be executed.\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-09-21T07:35:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-24T16:26:06", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/vulnerability-reports/-/issues/160", "https://github.com/eclipse-rap/org.eclipse.rap/pull/141"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-4760"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a034fa7-42d5-3386-91ad-c263a0318d08", "product": {"name": "Eclipse RAP"}, "product_version": "3.0.0 \u22643.25.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d243ecf-cf7c-3a58-9bbb-4c663cf2411c", "vendor": {"name": "Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
