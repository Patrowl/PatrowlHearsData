Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.\nThis patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated. \n", "datePublished": "2023-05-26T20:11:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-14T19:30:59", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/highlight/highlight/security/advisories/GHSA-9qpj-qq2r-5mcc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33187", "https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/pull/1184", "https://github.com/highlight/highlight"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-33187", "GHSA-9qpj-qq2r-5mcc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee145728-b6d2-3342-b7f0-ae2edc6ff76c", "product": {"name": "Highlight"}, "product_version": "< 6.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6c812fef-26cd-3987-96c6-5144276796c7", "vendor": {"name": "highlight"}}], "isExploited": false}
