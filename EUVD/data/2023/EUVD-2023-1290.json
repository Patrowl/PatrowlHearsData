Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-04-25T18:22:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-03T19:34:54", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/security/advisories/GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30838", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/46408ae4b02f3b8b1bb6e9dc63af5bcd858abd9c", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/dc682192df0e4b0d656a8e645b29ca1b9dbe3693", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/1.7.8.9", "https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/8.0.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30838", "GHSA-fh7r-996q-gvcp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3f159771-ec91-3f36-9560-a716da10d18e", "product": {"name": "PrestaShop"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, < 8.0.4"}, {"id": "593dd9f6-68a7-3db5-a8d9-1a415b4028b4", "product": {"name": "PrestaShop"}, "product_version": "< 1.7.8.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d8110a8c-e880-3515-9c49-3adce6852d21", "vendor": {"name": "PrestaShop"}}], "isExploited": false}
