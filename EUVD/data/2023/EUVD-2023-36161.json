The software comes prepackaged with a root owned SUID binary dm_secure_writer. The binary has security controls in place preventing creation of a file in a non-owned directory, or as the root user. However, these controls can be carefully bypassed to allow for an arbitrary file write as root.", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-22T14:51:08", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://gist.github.com/picar0jsu/a8e623639da34f36202ce5e436668de7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31871"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "94baabae-593c-31fc-862d-5dd43bc9c18c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3b328b4c-f96c-3d57-b4c9-3c224b81e3a5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
