A polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters. This issue has been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should validate that their input comes from trusted sources.\n\n\n\n\n### Impact\n\nA polynomial time complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```\n$ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = \"_\" * 100000; print(pad + \".\" + pad, end=\"\")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext\n```\n\nIncreasing the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to increase quadratically.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability have been patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10.\n\n### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm\n\nXXX: TBD\n\n[cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over time, but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and `cmark-gfm`. \n\n### Credit\n\nWe would like to thank @gravypod for reporting this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [github/cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm)\n", "datePublished": "2023-03-31T22:01:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-11T17:20:37", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-r8vr-c48j-fcc5", "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/commit/07a66c9bc341f902878e37d7da8647d6ef150987"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26485"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a473638c-2e1c-3232-a9e2-1079510cad7f", "product": {"name": "cmark-gfm"}, "product_version": "< 0.29.0.gfm.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6f467af2-bec1-3296-8d59-08e9fddffcdc", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
