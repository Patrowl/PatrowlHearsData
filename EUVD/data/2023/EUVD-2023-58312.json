Specifically, if a site certificate lacks the \"Server Authentication\" specification in the Extended Key Usage extension, the product does not verify the certificate's compliance with the site, deeming such certificates as valid. This flaw could allow an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting and potentially altering communications between the user and the website.", "datePublished": "2024-10-18T07:17:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T15:28:39", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://bitdefender.com/support/security-advisories/improper-certificate-validation-in-bitdefender-total-security-https-scanning-va-11158/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6055"], "assigner": "Bitdefender", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e22f5b06-0ce5-3cff-a8b3-f5cf49f64b88", "product": {"name": "Total Security"}, "product_version": "0 <27.0.25.115"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd29bb8e-4577-3275-b702-84be7f9c2dc9", "vendor": {"name": "Bitdefender"}}], "isExploited": false}
