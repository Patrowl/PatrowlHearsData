This issue has been addressed in version 1.1.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are several ways to workaround or lower the probability of this bug affecting a given deployment. 1: use a reasonably high `POLL_TIMEOUT` setting, like the default. 2: use separate libmemcached connections for unrelated data. 3: do not re-use libmemcached connections in an unknown state.", "datePublished": "2023-03-07T17:55:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T15:00:43", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-27478.html", "https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/security/advisories/GHSA-wwmh-39wj-fx59", "https://github.com/php-memcached-dev/php-memcached/issues/531", "https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/commit/48dcc61a", "https://github.com/awesomized/libmemcached/releases/tag/1.1.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27478"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "362fd74f-2a08-3413-9fb8-ebcef302b9c7", "product": {"name": "libmemcached"}, "product_version": "> 1.0.18,  < 1.1.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a546f23e-bfce-34a7-800c-f1901c3eed13", "vendor": {"name": "awesomized"}}], "isExploited": false}
