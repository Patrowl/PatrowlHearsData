A p2c parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2 require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function, making password brute-force and dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore, if an attacker sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-12-04T23:42:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-29T13:39:54", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/security/advisories/GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49290", "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/commit/64f2a229b8e18605f47361d292b526bdc4aee01c", "https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49290", "GHSA-7f9x-gw85-8grf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22c6362a-7a0d-393c-a207-e724efc69000", "product": {"name": "jwx"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.27"}, {"id": "d2b0ad09-88e3-3209-b216-c941f3ffd485", "product": {"name": "jwx"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.0.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3b3f4e74-412f-3075-8a0f-832706090703", "vendor": {"name": "lestrrat-go"}}], "isExploited": false}
