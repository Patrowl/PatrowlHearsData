In versions 4.9 and prior, when a packet is received, the Contiki-NG network stack attempts to start the periodic TCP timer if it is a TCP packet with the SYN flag set. But the implementation does not first verify that a full TCP header has been received. Specifically, the implementation attempts to access the flags field from the TCP buffer in the following conditional expression in the `check_for_tcp_syn` function. For this reason, an attacker can inject a truncated TCP packet, which will lead to an out-of-bound read from the packet buffer. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2510 to patch the system.", "datePublished": "2023-09-15T19:19:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T18:04:01", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-6648-m23r-hq8c", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2510"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37459"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d53f58a3-6762-3162-8467-b80847120487", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "616b5b93-287d-339d-91c0-44c2c5042dcf", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
