This is caused by GetSusp not correctly protecting a directory that it creates during execution, allowing an attacker to take over file handles used by GetSusp. As this runs with high privileges, the attacker gains elevated permissions. The file handles are opened as read-only. \n\n", "datePublished": "2023-11-16T09:39:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:21:17", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10412"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6119"], "assigner": "trellix", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "600d97f7-479c-395c-8d19-6db503b55dab", "product": {"name": "GetSusp"}, "product_version": "Prior to 5.0.0.27"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87974172-d583-399a-abdf-dcbbc20e4c49", "vendor": {"name": "Trellix"}}], "isExploited": false}
