In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. This issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-08-14T19:53:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-02T20:36:40", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/security/advisories/GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40024", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/blob/dd7769fbc97c84545579cebf1dc4838214098a11/CHANGELOG.rst#v3252-2023-08-14", "https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/releases/tag/v32.5.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40024", "GHSA-6xcx-gx7r-rccj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8cef4500-3087-31d4-a739-aa61a16089a8", "product": {"name": "scancode.io"}, "product_version": "< 32.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fc4d50c5-d062-3808-85da-8096d1c875a7", "vendor": {"name": "nexB"}}], "isExploited": false}
