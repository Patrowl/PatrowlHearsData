If pd_free_fn() for parent is called\nbefore child, then UAF can be triggered. Hence it's better to guarantee\nthe order of pd_free_fn().\n\nCurrently refcount of parent blkg is dropped in __blkg_release(), which\nis before pd_free_fn() is called in blkg_free_work_fn() while\nblkg_free_work_fn() is called asynchronously.\n\nThis patch make sure pd_free_fn() called from removing cgroup is ordered\nby delaying dropping parent refcount after calling pd_free_fn() for\nchild.\n\nBTW, pd_free_fn() will also be called from blkcg_deactivate_policy()\nfrom deleting device, and following patches will guarantee the order.", "datePublished": "2025-12-24T13:06:31", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-05T10:33:48", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c7241babf0855d8a6180cd1743ff0ec34de40b4e", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-54107"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-54107"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b4e623c-1c0f-3d7a-a3aa-5a5a82d6b80d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "d578c770c85233af592e54537f93f3831bde7e9a <c7241babf0855d8a6180cd1743ff0ec34de40b4e"}, {"id": "5073c29b-b5bc-3bd2-9697-428635d7a80d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "96068a78-4df9-3932-95cd-dffec3eeef33", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.3"}, {"id": "b20051ff-8ba4-3a3b-9580-cfd090144b81", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.18"}, {"id": "b7909216-01ff-3ca0-89a1-26acc7e4a82e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <c7241babf0855d8a6180cd1743ff0ec34de40b4e"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f3a910c2-e4da-301a-af73-f2f7a48d20b2", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
