If the protocol has been compiled using default settings, this will only grant the attacker access to allocated but unused memory. However, if it was configured using non-default settings, there is the possibility that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to system crashes and remote code execution. \n\n", "datePublished": "2023-02-28T23:16:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-16T21:55:38", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-047-13", "https://github.com/Sub-IoT/Sub-IoT-Stack/security/advisories/GHSA-ggxh-88wc-c4fg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-0847"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 2.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10ba9083-0e89-3cc9-8a00-f3067c6cd943", "product": {"name": "DASH 7 Alliance Protocol stack implementation"}, "product_version": "0 <0.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a2b43e24-82a9-32d2-8805-ae45a1a44a18", "vendor": {"name": "Sub-IoT"}}], "isExploited": false}
