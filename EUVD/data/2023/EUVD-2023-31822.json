Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing a large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI causes a segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a large amount of shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB of RAM. On the test system, this issue occurred when shared memory was set to `2362` or higher. This issue is fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The only workaround is to guarantee that the Content-Length value of input messages is never larger than `2147483647`.", "datePublished": "2023-03-15T22:03:41", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:56:16", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://opensips.org/pub/audit-2022/opensips-audit-technical-report-full.pdf", "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/security/advisories/GHSA-c6j5-f4h4-2xrq", "https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/commit/7cab422e2fc648f910abba34f3f0dbb3ae171ff5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28097"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "90b0a55c-2c74-3cf7-9578-282eda9692e5", "product": {"name": "opensips"}, "product_version": "< 3.1.9"}, {"id": "e280cd5f-e313-3ac0-95a7-da69afa27592", "product": {"name": "opensips"}, "product_version": "3.2.0, < 3.2.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5d03dace-eebe-3d87-81cb-7ff69aaa2a1f", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSIPS"}}], "isExploited": false}
