Starting in version 3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1, the mail obfuscation configuration was not fully taken into account. While the mail displayed to the end user was obfuscated, the rest response was also containing the mail unobfuscated and users were able to filter and sort on the unobfuscated, allowing them to infer the mail content. The consequence was the possibility to retrieve the email addresses of all users even when obfuscated. This has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0-rc-1.", "datePublished": "2023-06-23T16:20:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-29T14:35:59", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-7vr7-cghh-ch63", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34467", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/71f889db9962df2d385f4298e29cfbc9050b828a#diff-5a739e5865b1f1ad9d79b724791be51b0095a0170cc078911c940478b13b949a", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20333"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34467", "GHSA-7vr7-cghh-ch63"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "178b5363-0b17-3d12-b587-d5952e2f5dc0", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "3.5-milestone-1, < 14.4.8"}, {"id": "a925c07d-25a0-3ec9-bbb1-e7b2e3924ec5", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "14.5, < 14.10.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c36e7864-2515-38d3-b646-1f68f5210283", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
