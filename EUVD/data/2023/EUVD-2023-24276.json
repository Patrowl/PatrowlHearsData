This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of commands that are issued from a wireless controller to an AP. An attacker with Administrator access to the CLI of the controller could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain full root access on the AP.", "datePublished": "2023-03-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:02:19", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aironetap-cmdinj-6bjT4FL8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20097"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b36df92-8efa-3072-a0ac-e053d55b4559", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dc201cf6-42cf-3835-a89c-04b954090950", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
