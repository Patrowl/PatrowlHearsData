This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "datePublished": "2023-08-31T05:33:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-05T19:33:18", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6a765360-8603-4ba1-a6db-dd0175ff3ddf?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/woo-pdf-invoice-builder/trunk/woocommerce-pdf-invoice-ajax.php?rev=2935371#L654", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=2953379%40woo-pdf-invoice-builder%2Ftrunk&old=2951617%40woo-pdf-invoice-builder%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-4160"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "987220be-3e50-37f8-a5d6-f4f2942de03c", "product": {"name": "WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder, Create invoices, packing slips and more"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.2.90"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e60c526-aba8-3020-b8a9-8995ab648c55", "vendor": {"name": "edgarrojas"}}], "isExploited": false}
