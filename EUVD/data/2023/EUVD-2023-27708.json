Versions prior to and including 4.8 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write that can occur in the BLE-L2CAP module. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up the configured MTU size. When fragments are reassembled, they are stored in a packet buffer of a configurable size, but there is no check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the reassembled packet. In Contiki-NG's default configuration, it is possible that an out-of-bounds write of up to 1152 bytes occurs. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2254 prior to the release of version 4.9.", "datePublished": "2023-01-25T06:15:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:35:33", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-qr4q-6h3m-h3g7", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2254"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-23609"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4047104d-044e-37f9-ad3c-72f0a0606504", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eb5d3e0a-17dd-3297-92a9-c3260ad5645a", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
