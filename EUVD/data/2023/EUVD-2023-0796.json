The\ncaller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a\nPEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()\nwill return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer\nto a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer\nthen a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This\ncould be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM\nfiles for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.\n\nThe functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around\nPEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.\n\nThese functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL\nfunctions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and\nSSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal\nuses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the\nheader argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations\ninclude the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in\nOpenSSL 3.0.\n\nThe OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-02-08T19:04:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:14:13", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4450", "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=63bcf189be73a9cc1264059bed6f57974be74a83", "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=bbcf509bd046b34cca19c766bbddc31683d0858b", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0010.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08", "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5343", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:0946", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-4450.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-4450", "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0003"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-4450", "GHSA-v5w6-wcm8-jm4q"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3ef39e3e-0ce8-3bb2-8e11-021bd322080c", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.0.0 <3.0.8"}, {"id": "af20b699-6db0-36f6-80fa-81158351f620", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "1.1.1 <1.1.1t"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c662b584-541a-3e20-a854-ab37172ba468", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
