Versions of Pimcore prior to 10.5.18 are vulnerable to path traversal. The impact of this path traversal and arbitrary extension is limited to creation of arbitrary files and appending data to existing files. When combined with the SQL Injection, the exported data `RESTRICTED DIFFUSION 9 / 9` can be controlled and a webshell can be uploaded. Attackers can use that to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server with the permissions of the webserver. Users may upgrade to version 10.5.18 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the patch manually.", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T17:59:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-29T15:07:36", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/security/advisories/GHSA-g2mc-fqqc-hxg3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30855", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14498", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/7f788fa44bc18bc1c9182c25e26b770a1d30b62f.patch", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/f1d904094700b513c4756904fa2b1e19d08d890e.patch", "https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30855", "GHSA-g2mc-fqqc-hxg3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 100.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "21d4266b-29f1-30b3-a5e6-b354d0d5ed1c", "product": {"name": "pimcore"}, "product_version": "< 10.5.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c1df32d-94c7-31b7-8306-df7b91bff55a", "vendor": {"name": "pimcore"}}], "isExploited": false}
