A path traversal and arbitrary file write vulnerability exists in versions of Atril prior to 1.26.2. This vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access. The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to overwrite existing files, but that doesn't stop an attacker from achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. Version 1.26.2 of Atril contains a patch for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-01-25T15:30:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:19:58", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril/security/advisories/GHSA-6mf6-mxpc-jc37", "https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril/commit/e70b21c815418a1e6ebedf6d8d31b8477c03ba50", "https://github.com/mate-desktop/atril/releases/tag/v1.26.2", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00003.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-52076"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 8.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3009c6d8-9ad9-35ec-9524-5677d2a9610f", "product": {"name": "atril"}, "product_version": "< 1.26.2"}, {"id": "57810798-abca-3c88-8f8f-caa8aa499aba", "product": {"name": "atril"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "730dc1f4-593a-3dd6-be3b-e65164b0dcd3", "vendor": {"name": "mate-desktop"}}], "isExploited": false}
