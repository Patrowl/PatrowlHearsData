This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to the plugin to change the '_cmsc_public_key' in the plugin config, providing access to the plugin's remote control functionalities, such as creating an admin access URL, which can be used for privilege escalation. This can only be exploited if the plugin has not been configured yet, however, if combined with another arbitrary plugin installation and activation vulnerability, the impact can be severe.", "datePublished": "2023-06-20T04:27:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-03T16:22:24", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ca37d453-9f9a-46b2-a17f-65a16e3e2ed1?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cms-commander-client/tags/2.287/init.php#L88", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2927811/cms-commander-client"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-3325"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f9939181-05a0-35ea-b653-cfee4df7c188", "product": {"name": "CMS Commander \u2013 Manage Multiple Sites"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.287"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7792b0c4-b277-3ce0-9e5e-24f373977b3f", "vendor": {"name": "thoefter"}}], "isExploited": false}
