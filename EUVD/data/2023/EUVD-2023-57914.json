This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "datePublished": "2023-10-18T07:31:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-05T19:15:21", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/547c425d-8b0f-4e65-8b8a-c3a3059301fe?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-responsive-slider-with-lightbox/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=1263536%40wp-responsive-slider-with-lightbox&new=1263536%40wp-responsive-slider-with-lightbox&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-5621"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c44f2ab2-a614-3ae0-81b4-2e324107bc56", "product": {"name": "Thumbnail Slider With Lightbox"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8522df17-1b07-3919-a656-c55742a62a90", "vendor": {"name": "nik00726"}}], "isExploited": false}
