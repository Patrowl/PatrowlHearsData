In Cacti 1.2.24, under certain conditions, an authenticated privileged user, can use a malicious string in the SNMP options of a Device, performing command injection and obtaining remote code execution on the underlying server. The `lib/snmp.php` file has a set of functions, with similar behavior, that accept in input some variables and place them into an `exec` call without a proper escape or validation. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T21:16:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:02:59", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-g6ff-58cj-x3cp", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175029/Cacti-1.2.24-Command-Injection.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00018.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39362"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 86.74, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02a2fb52-348b-3ff5-9f4b-2f9a42747c1e", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9aba8a9-09d4-3705-9622-ef6f83200da8", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
