This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in mystickymenu-contact-leads.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the export of a CSV file containing contact leads via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Because the CSV file is exported to a public location, it can be downloaded during a very short window of time before it is automatically deleted by the export function.", "datePublished": "2024-01-11T08:32:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-03T14:08:52", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/be0ab40f-cff7-48bd-8dae-cc50af047151?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3016780/mystickymenu"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-7048"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "57326084-7dee-3ffb-a2d5-b3feecf66e43", "product": {"name": "Floating Notification Bar, Sticky Menu on Scroll, Announcement Banner, and Sticky Header for Any Theme \u2013 My Sticky Bar (formerly myStickymenu)"}}, {"id": "6678e079-9b23-3877-a58d-d06a96a31950", "product": {"name": "Floating Notification Bar, Sticky Menu on Scroll, Announcement Banner, and Sticky Header for Any Theme \u2013 My Sticky Bar (formerly myStickymenu)"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.6.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "58bd1a22-c544-3498-b3b5-bc3b4d109cfc", "vendor": {"name": "galdub"}}], "isExploited": false}
