Password reset links are sent by email. A link contains a token that is used to reset the password. This token remains valid even after the password reset and can be used a second time to change the password of the corresponding user. The token expires only 3 hours after issuance and is sent as a query parameter when resetting. An attacker with access to the browser history can thus use the token again to change the password in order to take over the account.", "datePublished": "2023-04-27T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:50:05", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-31287", "https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/commit/11b9d267f840513d04b4f4d4876de7823a6e48d2", "https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity", "https://packetstorm.news/files/id/172648", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/172648/Serenity-StartSharp-Software-File-Upload-XSS-User-Enumeration-Reusable-Tokens.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/May/14"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31287", "GHSA-2hp9-3xfr-r9w2"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "74ac36d1-84ed-3612-99df-85a17ab6e324", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16b4f8f7-a6f5-39d0-a40f-c60fc1fa5972", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
