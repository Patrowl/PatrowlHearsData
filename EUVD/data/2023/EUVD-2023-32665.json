This is possible through the use of LLMNR, MBT-NS, or MDNS and will result in NTLMv2 hashes being sent to a malicious entity position on the local network. These hashes can subsequently be attacked through brute force and cracked if a weak password is used. This attack would only apply to domain joined systems.", "datePublished": "2023-11-28T20:34:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:00:15", "baseScore": 3.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.bd.com/en-us/about-bd/cybersecurity/bulletin/bd-facschorus-software"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29062"], "assigner": "BD", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b9dde517-1137-34bb-b353-3eb4b9e36321", "product": {"name": "FACSChorus"}, "product_version": "5.0 \u22645.1"}, {"id": "fd2f2763-6fb7-3728-b755-b31c1a033b05", "product": {"name": "FACSChorus"}, "product_version": "3.0 \u22643.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b8fd5b16-34c2-38d7-882a-200d3cc49caa", "vendor": {"name": "Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD)"}}], "isExploited": false}
