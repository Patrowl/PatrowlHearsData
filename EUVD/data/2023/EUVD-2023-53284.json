NOTE: this issue is not always security related, but can be security related in realistic situations. A possible example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities (coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access control, such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs less often in version 2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4, because of the default configuration in those versions.", "datePublished": "2023-11-24T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T19:28:35", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15571", "https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/15526", "https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=275308", "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38405731", "https://web.archive.org/web/20231124172959/https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-remove-missing%C2%A0newline%C2%A0or%C2%A0line%C2%A0too%C2%A0long-error-etchostsallow%C2%A0and%C2%A0etchostsdeny-files", "https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.2.2", "https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/releases/tag/zfs-2.1.14", "https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/04/two_new_versions_of_openzfs/", "https://bugs.gentoo.org/917224", "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38770168", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00019.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49298", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00009.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49298"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "132752f0-376e-3ca3-884c-7ac985641bc4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "06e854a6-a1cd-3006-a998-681a4d1dca1c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
