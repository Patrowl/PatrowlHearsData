Starting with RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z and prior to RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z, a user with `consoleAdmin` permissions can potentially create a user that matches the root credential `accessKey`. Once this user is created successfully, the root credential ceases to work appropriately. The issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z. There are ways to work around this via adding higher privileges to the disabled root user via `mc admin policy set`.", "datePublished": "2023-03-14T18:22:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:57:36", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-9wfv-wmf7-6753", "https://github.com/minio/minio/pull/16803"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-27589"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1bd3fdc9-2cf0-3ba9-bd5f-59d6398b56dc", "product": {"name": "minio"}, "product_version": "RELEASE.2020-12-23T02-24-12Z, < RELEASE.2023-03-13T19-46-17Z"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f742bdc3-3ccd-35ef-95cc-dbdeca27452e", "vendor": {"name": "minio"}}], "isExploited": false}
