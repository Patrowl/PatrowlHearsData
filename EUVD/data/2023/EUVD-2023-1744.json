The polymorphic field type stores the classes to operate on when updating a record with user input, and does not validate them in the back end. This can lead to unexpected behavior, remote code execution, or application crashes when viewing a manipulated record. This issue has been addressed in commit `ec117882d` which is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to limit access to untrusted users until a new release is made.", "datePublished": "2023-06-05T22:16:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T15:48:32", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/security/advisories/GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34102", "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/commit/ec117882ddb1b519481bdd046dc3cfa4474e6e17", "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo", "https://github.com/avo-hq/avo/releases/tag/v2.33.3", "https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/gems/avo/CVE-2023-34102.yml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34102", "GHSA-86h2-2g4g-29qx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 7.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2686f353-f7f4-3ff6-90f2-0b600de80326", "product": {"name": "avo"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.33.2"}, {"id": "6883fa2a-8b96-3ac5-b733-09155949ab86", "product": {"name": "avo"}, "product_version": "3.0.0.pre1, \u2264 3.0.0.pre12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f281aa75-d7cc-35a9-b136-1e1f8f140715", "vendor": {"name": "avo-hq"}}], "isExploited": false}
