Starting in version 23.6.0 and prior to version 23.6.2, the Sentry API incorrectly returns the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP header if the `Origin` request header ends with the `system.base-hostname` option of Sentry installation. This only affects installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set, as it is empty by default. Impact is limited since recent versions of major browsers have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default. However, this flaw could allow other multi-step attacks. The patch has been released in Sentry 23.6.2.", "datePublished": "2023-07-07T02:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T11:27:52", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/ee44c6be35e5e464bc40637580f39867898acd8b", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/52276", "https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.6.2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36829", "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/19248fb9802c252665b802aeab02fdc65ed47dc9", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/sentry/PYSEC-2023-115.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-36829", "GHSA-4xqm-4p72-87h6", "PYSEC-2023-115"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13c738a1-5239-3c29-875a-5d40d436a0ca", "product": {"name": "sentry"}, "product_version": "23.6.0, < 23.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "569e6c90-afb8-3eb9-9cff-cf3c63175b61", "vendor": {"name": "getsentry"}}], "isExploited": false}
