{"id": "EUVD-2023-1192", "enisaUuid": "59bc40d0-721a-3b7e-af84-cfe09ceef08d", "description": "@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the Fastify ecosystem. Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected versions for user authentication, in combination with `@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport` library for user authentication. The login and user validation are performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId` upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.\n", "datePublished": "2023-04-21T22:28:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-04T19:38:59", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/security/advisories/GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29019", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport/commit/43c82c321db58ea3e375dd475de60befbfcf2a11", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify-passport", "https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29019", "GHSA-4m3m-ppvx-xgw9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1bae7626-eb56-387f-8640-a1824af89470", "product": {"name": "fastify-passport"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.0"}, {"id": "8721065c-c390-30da-a55a-3267d7a42bd4", "product": {"name": "fastify-passport"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "82171eb9-81c5-3528-a868-e782ea40c0b6", "vendor": {"name": "fastify"}}], "isExploited": false}
