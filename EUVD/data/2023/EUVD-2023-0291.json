Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 3.0.0, credentials provided to onboarding task are visible via Job Results from an execution of an Onboarding Task. Version 3.0.0 fixes this issue; no known workarounds are available. Mitigation recommendations include deleting all Job Results for any onboarding task to remove clear text credentials from database entries that were run while on v2.0.X, upgrading to v3.0.0, and rotating any exposed credentials.", "datePublished": "2023-11-22T01:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T04:22:55", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding/security/advisories/GHSA-qf3c-rw9f-jh7v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48700", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/nautobot-device-onboarding/PYSEC-2023-288.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48700", "GHSA-qf3c-rw9f-jh7v", "PYSEC-2023-288"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eeabe410-6226-3871-8874-b8478e88bbae", "product": {"name": "nautobot-plugin-device-onboarding"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 3.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff1ded76-77f1-3af9-b3e9-3b554bff7ed9", "vendor": {"name": "nautobot"}}], "isExploited": false}
