This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an arbitrary file to a user and persuading that user to browse to a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2023-03-03T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:03:19", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-xss-Yn8HHsMJ"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20104"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02282bf3-2909-385f-8c73-c0863b2170cf", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Teams"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "820330c4-4f6c-3461-99a8-237393ff7f86", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
