An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c` module. More specifically, the `read_frame` function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet, which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length, it is not validated to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to update their develop branch or to update to a subsequent release when available. Users unable to upgrade should consider manually applying the changes in PR #2741.", "datePublished": "2024-02-14T18:30:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T21:23:39", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-rcwv-xwc9-5hp2", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2741"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48229"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ac50988-9d15-3dd3-a258-23af340a3c6d", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "664d518e-22aa-3628-925b-cf4d521b59c3", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
