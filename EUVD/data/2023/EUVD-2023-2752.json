Affected versions of OpenFGA are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. When a number of `ListObjects` calls are executed, in some scenarios, those calls are not releasing resources even after a response has been sent, and given a sufficient call volume the service as a whole becomes unresponsive. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4 and the upgrade is considered backwards compatible. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-10-17T22:29:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-13T15:34:47", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-hr4f-6jh8-f2vq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45810", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.3.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45810", "GHSA-hr4f-6jh8-f2vq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "39ef9ac7-33ff-3b38-a41e-44086de2b208", "product": {"name": "openfga"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0df5eee1-d2e4-3b94-a9cf-1c1e635ae2ab", "vendor": {"name": "openfga"}}], "isExploited": false}
