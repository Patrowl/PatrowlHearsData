This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information. A successful exploit could also cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker or consume memory resources to reduce the availability of the web-based management interface. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super Admin or Policy Admin credentials.", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:01:55", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-xxe-inj-GecEHY58"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20030"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5e6acb7f-cd1c-3d5f-814a-df4a7b7cae75", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "45d55b93-e05c-3f40-9bf4-d65538965d7d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
