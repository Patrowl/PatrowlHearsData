The attacker must have valid low-privileged user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) with the integration of PnP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending a query to an internal API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in clear text, which could include configuration files.", "datePublished": "2023-03-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:02:49", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-dnac-infodisc-pe7zAbdR"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20059"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2dca3fb9-feed-3c99-b921-c53a2a178734", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a177fbec-3412-3b88-aa27-2af74537005b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
