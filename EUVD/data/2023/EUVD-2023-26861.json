Prior to Git for Windows version 2.39.2, by carefully crafting DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a specific name living next to the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked into side-loading said DLL. This potentially allows users with local write access to place malicious payloads in a location where automated upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation. Version 2.39.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Never leave untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows installer, or move the installer into a different directory before executing it.", "datePublished": "2023-02-14T20:39:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:20:30", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-p2x9-prp4-8gvq", "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gf48-x3vr-j5c3", "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/", "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.39.2.windows.1", "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/cookbook-overview?redirectedfrom=MSDN#using-comctl32dll-version-6-in-an-application-that-uses-only-standard-extensions", "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/about-side-by-side-assemblies-"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22743"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f4df5643-f026-377a-86ee-a3f8e073c3b6", "product": {"name": "Git"}, "product_version": "< 2.39.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aafca02d-d713-3f47-aade-e98f8baae07e", "vendor": {"name": "git-for-windows"}}], "isExploited": false}
