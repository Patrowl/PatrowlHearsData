The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the Filesystem scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously dotfiles were not implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a regression was introduced when a configuration option for this behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications using wildcard scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been patched on version 1.4.1.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-23T19:09:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T19:04:00", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-6mv3-wm7j-h4w5", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/security/advisories/GHSA-wmff-grcw-jcfm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34460", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/6969#discussion_r1232018347", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/7227", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/066c09a6ea06f42f550d090715e06beb65cd5564", "https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34460", "GHSA-wmff-grcw-jcfm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f658549-4b50-3984-9a85-3f78ec469d99", "product": {"name": "tauri"}, "product_version": "= 1.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "17d49d61-7d01-3a9a-8051-e8d149935142", "vendor": {"name": "tauri-apps"}}], "isExploited": false}
