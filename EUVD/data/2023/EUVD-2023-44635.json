Versions of uthenticode prior to the 2.x series did not check Extended Key Usages in certificates, in violation of the Authenticode X.509 certificate profile. As a result, a malicious user could produce a \"signed\" PE file that uthenticode would verify and consider valid using an X.509 certificate that isn't entitled to produce code signatures (e.g., a SSL certificate). By design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However, the absence of EKU validation was an unintended oversight. The 2.0.0 release series includes EKU checks. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-08-09T15:33:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-03T15:15:51", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/security/advisories/GHSA-gm2f-j4rj-6xqj", "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/pull/78", "https://github.com/trailofbits/uthenticode/commit/caeb1eb62412605f71bd96ce9bb9420644b6db53"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40012"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "324d072d-7ba6-3462-9ec0-02e18395f5bf", "product": {"name": "uthenticode"}, "product_version": "< 2.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4976ce4a-f165-3436-9273-a2a4d3e0cf46", "vendor": {"name": "trailofbits"}}], "isExploited": false}
