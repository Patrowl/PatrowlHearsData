When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`.\n", "datePublished": "2023-02-09T20:54:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:35:33", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-23626", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/commit/5e1d256fe043fc4163343ccca83862c69c52e579", "https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1558"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-23626", "GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "99684fcd-281c-33ae-8976-f753b289f57e", "product": {"name": "go-bitfield"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7820fc0-cf77-3e06-81d7-8695673bfef9", "vendor": {"name": "IPFS"}}], "isExploited": false}
