Passing _callable strings_ (ie `system`) caused the function to be executed. This would result in a limited subset of specific user input being executed as if it were code. This issue has been addressed in commit `f4b1c48820` and included in release version 0.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that user input is not passed to either `EntityRepository::find()` or `query()`.", "datePublished": "2023-07-14T20:00:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-18T17:42:36", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/security/advisories/GHSA-7xr2-8ff7-6fjq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-37473", "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/commit/f4b1c488206e1b1581b06fcd331686846f13f19c", "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection", "https://github.com/zenstruck/collection/releases/tag/v0.2.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37473", "GHSA-7xr2-8ff7-6fjq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a91a7daf-8e3d-3e07-9f09-9a3d0de0f1a2", "product": {"name": "collection"}, "product_version": "< 0.2.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "133801d3-9c5a-3ba2-8129-1ce2f0b847dc", "vendor": {"name": "zenstruck"}}], "isExploited": false}
