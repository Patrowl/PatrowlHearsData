This is due to the insecure use of file_get_contents without appropriate verification of the data being supplied to the function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to retrieve the contents of files like wp-config.php hosted on the system, perform a deserialization attack and possibly achieve remote code execution, and make requests to internal services.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T05:33:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-23T16:19:33", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/800fa098-b29f-4979-b7bd-b1186a4dafcb?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpforo/tags/2.1.7/classes/Actions.php#L444", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpforo/tags/2.1.8/classes/Actions.php#L437"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-2249"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 46.78, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c092bc90-fcec-3fca-80fe-07daa2ece0f3", "product": {"name": "wpForo Forum"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.1.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0aaf94cc-3b69-39b4-b607-2e85efa7c71e", "vendor": {"name": "tomdever"}}], "isExploited": false}
