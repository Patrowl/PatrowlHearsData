The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `sql_api/api_workflow.py` endpoint `ExecuteCheck` which passes unfiltered input to the `explain_check` method in `sql/engines/oracle.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter value in the `api_workflow.py` `ExecuteCheck` endpoint is passed through the `oracle.py` `execute_check` method and to the `explain_check` method for execution. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-103`.", "datePublished": "2023-04-18T22:35:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:28:51", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-3p43-89m6-7x5w"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30554"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "627ce131-db79-3523-9721-9bcbc27deedc", "product": {"name": "Archery"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f030398c-e903-39d7-8486-4b83a753f59a", "vendor": {"name": "hhyo"}}], "isExploited": false}
