Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3.", "datePublished": "2023-07-13T22:33:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-30T18:46:55", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gj-2chr-4ch6", "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4761"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-37273"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9a562767-2683-388f-9b5f-f55346609036", "product": {"name": "Auto-GPT"}, "product_version": "< 0.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "65a7625b-376c-33cc-8c52-d7c66df02104", "vendor": {"name": "Significant-Gravitas"}}], "isExploited": false}
