Versions prior to 3.0.2 are vulnerable to command injection via single sign-on(SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 3.0.2 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T21:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-16T18:28:10", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/commit/1cdbd3b1403c5ef520d7f4d9614fe35165e101ac", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/security/advisories/GHSA-5w5m-pfw9-c8fp", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/1480", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/pull/1480", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34233", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/snowflake-connector-python/PYSEC-2023-88.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34233", "GHSA-5w5m-pfw9-c8fp", "PYSEC-2023-88"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a2835004-8c64-3400-8af9-d9529b8dfa53", "product": {"name": "snowflake-connector-python"}, "product_version": "< 3.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "29792b93-2448-39ed-bfa7-4b67c38ab7de", "vendor": {"name": "snowflakedb"}}], "isExploited": false}
