This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-06T17:13:23", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-2455", "https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2023-2455/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230706-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-2455"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ac9c9210-c700-335e-9587-71a963412793", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
