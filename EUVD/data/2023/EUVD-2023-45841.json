Through a carefully\ncrafted payload, an attacker can achieve JNDI injection or system command execution. In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework, a blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes encountered during the deserialization process. However, the blacklist is not comprehensive, and an actor can exploit certain native JDK classes and common third-party packages to construct gadget chains capable of achieving JNDI injection or system command execution attacks. Version 5.11.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, users can add `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat` to the blacklist.", "datePublished": "2023-09-12T19:57:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T19:52:21", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/security/advisories/GHSA-chv2-7hxj-2j86", "https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/releases/tag/v5.11.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41331"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 3.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "310e8bed-0808-3829-bf0b-3fad69ed08bc", "product": {"name": "sofa-rpc"}, "product_version": "< 5.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80821ca1-2f59-3d4c-b305-b7d72c19e91e", "vendor": {"name": "sofastack"}}], "isExploited": false}
