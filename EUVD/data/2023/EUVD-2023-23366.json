The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this, which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.", "datePublished": "2023-03-27T21:30:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-05T18:32:36", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-1078.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2023-1078.html", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/commit/?id=f753a68980cf4b59a80fe677619da2b1804f526d", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00005.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00006.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230505-0004/", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/05/1", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1078"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1078"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "59987a94-678c-3227-820e-66a7e79196c5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
