Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a connector\nclient override policy that permits them.\n\nSince Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property (\"-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\") to disable the problematic login modules usage\nin SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default \"com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule\" is disabled in Apache Kafka Connect 3.4.0. \n\nWe advise the Kafka Connect users to validate connector configurations and only allow trusted JNDI configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for \nvulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,\nin addition to leveraging the \"org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules\" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector\nclient config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot.\n", "datePublished": "2023-02-07T19:11:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:18:35", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25194", "https://hackerone.com/reports/1529790", "https://kafka.apache.org/cve-list", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/vy1c7fqcdqvq5grcqp6q5jyyb302khyz", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173151/Apache-Druid-JNDI-Injection-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-25194.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25194", "GHSA-26f8-x7cc-wqpc"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 94.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9946f35b-317b-3ad0-8de8-ab6ed8f35fcb", "product": {"name": "Apache Kafka Connect API"}, "product_version": "2.3.0 <3.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b00fb8fb-06ef-3c26-a34a-20f59eae2a20", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
