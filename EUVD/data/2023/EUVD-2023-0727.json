Missing check vulnerability in the static file handler allows any client to access the files in the server's file system. When `staticFiles` is set in the `serve` settings in the configuration file, the following handler doesn't check if `absolutePath` is still under the directory provided as `staticFiles`. Users have two options to fix vulnerability; 1. Update `@graphql-mesh/cli` to a version higher than `0.82.21`, and if you use `@graphql-mesh/http`, update it to a version higher than `0.3.18` 2. Remove `staticFiles` option from the configuration, and use other solutions to serve static files.", "datePublished": "2025-02-20T20:13:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-20T21:04:05", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g", "https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh/commit/95d93e7c140c2995b37e9d822aa3fe4e24ed2e78", "https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh", "https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-mesh/security/advisories/GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27098"], "aliases": ["GHSA-j2wh-wrv3-4x4g", "CVE-2025-27098"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0af24230-4b54-319e-98d9-0ddeab96cf45", "product": {"name": "graphql-mesh"}, "product_version": "@graphql-mesh/cli:  0.78.0, < 0.82.22"}, {"id": "fa95e9b4-a724-3ba9-8b61-72cc019cd850", "product": {"name": "graphql-mesh"}, "product_version": "@graphql-mesh/http: < 0.3.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5f98b191-97ef-32e8-a98a-3bdd45f36352", "vendor": {"name": "ardatan"}}], "isExploited": false}
