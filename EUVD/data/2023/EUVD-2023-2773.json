Prior to version 0.6.2, a security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key authentication when keyboard-interactive SSH authentication is active, through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG. This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public key step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the keyboard-interaction mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting manipulated SSH requests using keyboard-interactive authentication mode. This could potentially result in unauthorized access to the Soft Serve. Users should upgrade to the latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this issue. To workaround this vulnerability without upgrading, users can temporarily disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the `allow-keyless` setting.", "datePublished": "2023-10-04T20:40:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-20T14:51:49", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/security/advisories/GHSA-mc97-99j4-vm2v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43809", "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/issues/389", "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/commit/407c4ec72d1006cee1ff8c1775e5bcc091c2bc89", "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve", "https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases/tag/v0.6.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-43809", "GHSA-mc97-99j4-vm2v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7b93ee2a-bafe-3fc5-9337-fef718c54e56", "product": {"name": "soft-serve"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ed21084c-7ab7-39f1-81b8-e0e12d13c37c", "vendor": {"name": "charmbracelet"}}], "isExploited": false}
