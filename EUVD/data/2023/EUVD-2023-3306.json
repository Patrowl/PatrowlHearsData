An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the slower rate than they are received; leading to storage of path validation data in an unbounded queue. \nQuiche versions greater than 0.19.0 address this problem.", "datePublished": "2023-12-12T13:32:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:21:17", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/security/advisories/GHSA-w3vp-jw9m-f9pm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6193", "https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/commit/ea7ecf39ae28ab24cf1785c1674dc2e8a076f9ca", "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8.2", "https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6193", "GHSA-w3vp-jw9m-f9pm"], "assigner": "cloudflare", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84e1d67c-37ca-319e-953d-b8c2cfb8a74a", "product": {"name": "quiche"}, "product_version": "0.15.0 \u22640.19.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "695bf78a-b79c-3028-887a-f8983f92add0", "vendor": {"name": "Cloudflare"}}], "isExploited": false}
