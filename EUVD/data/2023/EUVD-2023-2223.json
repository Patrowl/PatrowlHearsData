Flarum is affected by a vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose any file on the server, even with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image` package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a URL, which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, disclose local file contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in Flarum version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the SSRF aspect of the vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-08-16T20:34:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-02T16:00:40", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/flarum/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-67c6-q4j4-hccg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40033", "https://github.com/flarum/framework/commit/d1059c1cc79fe61f9538f3da55e8f42abbede570", "https://github.com/flarum/framework"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40033", "GHSA-67c6-q4j4-hccg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4f7abc2e-67de-32de-ab4a-c28c0b53b4ad", "product": {"name": "framework"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ccef2fd3-4769-3a0b-a820-eba3664651eb", "vendor": {"name": "flarum"}}], "isExploited": false}
