The `tj-actions/branch-names` GitHub Actions improperly references the `github.event.pull_request.head.ref` and `github.head_ref` context variables within a GitHub Actions `run` step. The head ref variable is the branch name and can be used to execute arbitrary code using a specially crafted branch name. As a result an attacker can use this vulnerability to steal secrets from or abuse `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 7.0.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-12-04T23:21:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T21:53:44", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/security/advisories/GHSA-8v8w-v8xg-79rf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49291", "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/4923d1ca41f928c24f1c1b3af9daaadfb71e6337", "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/6c999acf206f5561e19f46301bb310e9e70d8815", "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names/commit/726fe9ba5e9da4fcc716223b7994ffd0358af060", "https://github.com/tj-actions/branch-names", "https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49291", "GHSA-8v8w-v8xg-79rf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e4017463-fd0e-33a6-a498-745cd8653808", "product": {"name": "branch-names"}, "product_version": "< 7.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eedd9d00-5184-38af-b11b-d55986c57474", "vendor": {"name": "tj-actions"}}], "isExploited": false}
