In affected versions it was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`.\n", "datePublished": "2023-03-29T18:22:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T16:02:24", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-m8cg-xc2p-r3fc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25809", "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0d62b950e60f6980b54fe3bafd9a9c608dc1df17", "https://github.com/opencontainers/runc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25809", "GHSA-m8cg-xc2p-r3fc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b49c8034-7e8d-340d-a138-180a792d0a0a", "product": {"name": "runc"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "579bb41b-c7f5-341d-a1b3-ae3bde7fb09f", "vendor": {"name": "opencontainers"}}], "isExploited": false}
