{"id": "EUVD-2023-0483", "enisaUuid": "55cd4213-6ad2-33f2-9572-2911f8177568", "description": "The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result, downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known workarounds\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-01-04T14:57:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:13:48", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/security/advisories/GHSA-h857-2g56-468g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-22461", "https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg/commit/b107e453ede7b58adcccae74a3e474c012eec85d", "https://github.com/mattkrick/sanitize-svg"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22461", "GHSA-h857-2g56-468g"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "653df9cc-ab66-3db4-9719-22d2b029117c", "product": {"name": "sanitize-svg"}, "product_version": "< 0.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1b62c3f9-c77d-3f5e-9cb7-df96f68822cc", "vendor": {"name": "mattkrick"}}], "isExploited": false}
