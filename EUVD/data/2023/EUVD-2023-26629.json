When using the greader API, the provided password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt` in the case where the authentication fails. The issues occurs in `authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`. If there is an issue with the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is called. Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()` in the logs.  `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request. By default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const `COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this issue requires having access to logs produced by FreshRSS. Using the information from the logs, a malicious individual could get users' API keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username) or passwords.", "datePublished": "2023-03-06T17:33:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T15:01:23", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8vvv-jxg6-8578", "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/075cf4c800063e3cc65c3d41a9c23222e8ebb554"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22481"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d2b741b1-f191-348a-82a4-b6a0cbe116ce", "product": {"name": "FreshRSS"}, "product_version": "1.9.0, < 1.21.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b8599ea-adae-3515-b59c-3051cff1e190", "vendor": {"name": "FreshRSS"}}], "isExploited": false}
