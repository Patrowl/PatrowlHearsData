Prior to version 0.13.2,`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh functionality, can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the `etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm chart are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to an incorrect mount point specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd` cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that `etcd` cluster.\n\nThis issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a workaround, one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.", "datePublished": "2023-03-22T18:30:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:51:44", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-6f27-3p6c-p5jc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28114", "https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/commit/fb1427025764e1eebc4a7710d902c4f22cae2610", "https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/cilium/cilium", "https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli", "https://github.com/cilium/cilium-cli/releases/tag/v0.13.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28114", "GHSA-6f27-3p6c-p5jc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea31483f-ba44-361a-ba4f-a2fbdaf3df61", "product": {"name": "cilium-cli"}, "product_version": "< 0.13.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "34f9c1e1-9b5c-3c05-9dab-9a6e06bad52d", "vendor": {"name": "cilium"}}], "isExploited": false}
