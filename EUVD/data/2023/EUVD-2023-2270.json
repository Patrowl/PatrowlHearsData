In affected versions OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable without special tools. These messages typically contain a \"Hash: ...\" header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the \"Hash: ...\" texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was signed. A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned `verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and instead _visually trusting_ the contents of the original message. Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable. Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using `getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are considered when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring a CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a \"sanitised\" version, with the extraneous text being removed. This issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current stable version) which will reject messages when calling `openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and in version 4.10.11 (legacy version) which will will reject messages when calling `openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should check the contents of `verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.", "datePublished": "2023-08-29T16:46:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-30T17:43:47", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/security/advisories/GHSA-ch3c-v47x-4pgp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41037", "https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/commit/6b43e02a254853f5ff508ebd1b07541f78b7c566", "https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs", "https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/releases/tag/v4.10.11", "https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/releases/tag/v5.10.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41037", "GHSA-ch3c-v47x-4pgp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7a3eb55d-5f74-3873-81e8-93802a5b5ba5", "product": {"name": "openpgpjs"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.10.1"}, {"id": "9743be0b-1d8a-3991-9470-528755909ac6", "product": {"name": "openpgpjs"}, "product_version": "< 4.10.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "569f9a25-ac60-3e2a-b9fe-f79dfdca4bd1", "vendor": {"name": "openpgpjs"}}], "isExploited": false}
