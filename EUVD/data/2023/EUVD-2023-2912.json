In versions prior to 5.0.1 The exported activity `de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which results in a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim unable to open it. Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable. If you want to fix older versions change the attribute android:exported in plugin.xml to false. Please upgrade to version 5.0.1 as soon as possible.", "datePublished": "2021-12-23T16:20:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T04:10:16", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/security/advisories/GHSA-7vfx-hfvm-rhr8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43849", "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/commit/27434a240f97f69fd930088654590c8ba43569df", "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio", "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/discussions/394", "https://github.com/NiklasMerz/cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio/releases/tag/v5.0.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2021-43849", "GHSA-7vfx-hfvm-rhr8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "887e8211-4b8a-3313-8fbb-bd73d5ef17b4", "product": {"name": "cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio"}, "product_version": "< 5.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "66477921-24f7-3eed-a9c9-b38fc54cb89e", "vendor": {"name": "NiklasMerz"}}], "isExploited": false}
