When parsing relative ex addresses one may unintentionally cause an\noverflow. Ironically this happens in the existing overflow check, because the line number becomes negative and LONG_MAX - lnum will cause the overflow. Impact is low, user interaction is required and a crash may not even happen in all situations. This issue has been addressed in commit `060623e` which has been included in release version 9.0.2110. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-16T22:50:57", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:18:14", "baseScore": 2.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-6g74-hr6q-pr8g", "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/060623e4a3bc72b011e7cd92bedb3bfb64e06200", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/16/1", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M3VQF7CL3V6FGSEW37WNDFBRRILR65AK/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VNRNYLWXZOGTYWE5HMFNQ5FVE3HBUHF6/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4UJAK2W5S7G75ETDAEM3BDUCVSXCEGRD/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231227-0007/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48235"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f5c2f9ff-e295-3303-a4a1-e6151a29ebf6", "product": {"name": "vim"}, "product_version": "< 9.0.2110"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f191a75c-c7ae-30e8-8f17-c826e16693c6", "vendor": {"name": "vim"}}], "isExploited": false}
