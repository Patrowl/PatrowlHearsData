Users of the typed-rest-client library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows: First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`, `BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`. Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to a second host. Third, the next request will use the credentials to authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization` header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-04-26T20:58:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:49:37", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/security/advisories/GHSA-558p-m34m-vpmq", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-30846", "https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/pull/207", "https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client/commit/f9ff755631b982ee1303dfc3e3c823d0d31233e8", "https://github.com/microsoft/typed-rest-client", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230601-0008", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230601-0008/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30846", "GHSA-558p-m34m-vpmq"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0dc4eeae-be11-301f-8f7d-a4d43b7ba3f2", "product": {"name": "typed-rest-client"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fb7bef20-4618-3c02-a35a-2799ab10882e", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
