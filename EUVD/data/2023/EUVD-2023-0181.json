When submitting a Job to run via a Job Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked (i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general). Object-level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all configured JobButton Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and 2.1.0 ", "datePublished": "2023-12-22T07:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T04:22:55", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/issues/4988", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4993", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/4995", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-51649", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/3d964f996f4926126c1d7853ca87b2ff475997a2", "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/d33d0c15a36948c45244e5b5e10bc79b8e62de7f", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/nautobot/PYSEC-2023-287.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-51649", "GHSA-vf5m-xrhm-v999", "PYSEC-2023-287"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "95a4f4cd-dec7-32d1-b159-6a24c31354a5", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}, "product_version": "1.5.14, < 1.6.8"}, {"id": "be6b01c5-7d5b-395e-ae33-228d1cd428c2", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}}, {"id": "decb5035-946b-3905-846c-0ceaf1961f47", "product": {"name": "nautobot"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be6b01c5-7d5b-395e-ae33-228d1cd428c2", "vendor": {"name": "nautobot"}}], "isExploited": false}
