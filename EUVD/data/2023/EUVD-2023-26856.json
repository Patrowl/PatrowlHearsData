Prior to version 2022-12-09, every member of a Conversation can remove a Bot from a Conversation due to a missing permissions check. Only Conversation admins should be able to remove Bots. Regular Conversations are not allowed to do so. The issue is fixed in wire-server 2022-12-09 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-server need to be updated to 2022-12-09/Chart 4.29.0, so that their backends are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2023-01-27T23:14:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:20:30", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/security/advisories/GHSA-xmjc-c6w3-pcp4", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/pull/2870", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/commit/494a6881f5895d4ed9e5d011455242be0d5e6223", "https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2022-12-09"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22737"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "80a24427-c41c-3dd9-a83a-4b78e5f2748f", "product": {"name": "wire-server"}, "product_version": "< 2022-12-09"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1ce1e11b-a60a-39d4-bb53-8628f41bc39c", "vendor": {"name": "wireapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
