A number of pydash methods such as pydash.objects.invoke() and pydash.collections.invoke_map() accept dotted paths (Deep Path Strings) to target a nested Python object, relative to the original source object. These paths can be used to target internal class attributes and dict items, to retrieve, modify or invoke nested Python objects.\\r\\r**Note:**\\r\\rThe pydash.objects.invoke() method is vulnerable to Command Injection when the following prerequisites are satisfied:\\r\\r1) The source object (argument 1) is not a built-in object such as list/dict (otherwise, the __init__.__globals__ path is not accessible)\\r\\r2) The attacker has control over argument 2 (the path string) and argument 3 (the argument to pass to the invoked method)\\r\\r\\rThe pydash.collections.invoke_map() method is also vulnerable, but is harder to exploit as the attacker does not have direct control over the argument to be passed to the invoked function.", "datePublished": "2023-09-28T08:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-09-28T01:29:02", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/dgilland/pydash/commit/6ff0831ad285fff937cafd2a853f20cc9ae92021", "https://gist.github.com/CalumHutton/45d33e9ea55bf4953b3b31c84703dfca", "https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-PYDASH-5916518", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26145", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pydash/PYSEC-2023-179.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26145", "PYSEC-2023-179"], "assigner": "snyk", "epss": 1.77, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "440c9fee-3adc-3142-a6b2-a91be172b561", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
