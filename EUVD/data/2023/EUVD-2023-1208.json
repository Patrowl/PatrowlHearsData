The SvelteKit framework offers developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done by defining a `+server.js` file, containing endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods.\n\nSvelteKit provides out-of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users. While the implementation does a sufficient job in mitigating common CSRF attacks, prior to version 1.15.1, the protection can be bypassed by simply specifying a different `Content-Type` header value.\n\nIf abused, this issue will allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-party domains, which can allow execution of operations within the context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to unauthorized access to users\u2019 accounts.\n\nSvelteKit 1.15.1 updates the `is_form_content_type` function call in the CSRF protection logic to include `text/plain`. As additional hardening of the CSRF protection mechanism against potential method overrides, SvelteKit 1.15.1 is now performing validation on `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods as well. This latter hardening is only needed to protect users who have put in some sort of `?_method= override` feature themselves in their `handle` hook, so that the request that resolve sees could be `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` when the browser issues a `POST` request.", "datePublished": "2023-04-04T21:20:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T21:29:13", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/security/advisories/GHSA-5p75-vc5g-8rv2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29003", "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/commit/bb2253d51d00aba2e4353952d4fb0dcde6c77123", "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit", "https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fkit%401.15.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29003", "GHSA-5p75-vc5g-8rv2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a7cedd95-376a-343f-84bd-d2a6c47754ff", "product": {"name": "kit"}, "product_version": "< 1.15.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ee60658-2e2c-318d-a276-2a5c93d3019e", "vendor": {"name": "sveltejs"}}], "isExploited": false}
