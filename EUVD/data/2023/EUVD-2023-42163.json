The function ``tarExtract`` implements TAR file extraction and thereby also processes files within an archive that have relative or absolute file paths. A developer using the \"tarExtract\" function may expect that the function will strip leading slashes from absolute paths or stop processing when encountering relative paths that are outside of the extraction path, unless otherwise forced. This could lead to unexpected and undocumented behavior, which in general could result in a directory traversal, and associated unexpected behavior.", "datePublished": "2023-09-22T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-25T15:13:20", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=security-notices", "https://www.pentagrid.ch/en/blog/wind-river-vxworks-tarextract-directory-traversal-vulnerability/", "https://support2.windriver.com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2023-38346"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-38346"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee0b3546-338c-3ba2-825e-3f8af9a07f12", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7cf2ded9-1fd2-3fbb-ac04-82d4f30e86e8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
