The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. User input coming from the `db_name` in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_list` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in a given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to `sql/engines/mssql.py`, and `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-105`.", "datePublished": "2023-04-18T22:35:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:28:51", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-jwjj-jgfv-x66q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30558"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.75, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "168e2747-59cf-3af8-b7e7-cde48eb74a1b", "product": {"name": "Archery"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fc481f89-ba57-38d7-a6f5-f8327ebafe14", "vendor": {"name": "hhyo"}}], "isExploited": false}
