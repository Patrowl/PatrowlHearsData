Prior to version 1.0.0-rc.3, notation-go users will find their application using excessive memory when verifying signatures. The application will be killed, and thus availability is impacted. The problem has been patched in the release v1.0.0-rc.3. Some workarounds are available. Users can review their own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`. Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the `authenticity` validation is set to `enforce`.", "datePublished": "2023-02-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-27T16:45:09", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-87x9-7grx-m28v", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-25656", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/pull/275", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-25656", "GHSA-87x9-7grx-m28v"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8df64245-b862-385c-8a77-4f3c3f94f184", "product": {"name": "notation-go"}, "product_version": "1.0.0-rc.3 <1.0.0-rc.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dad58630-f47b-3860-922d-e82109147fac", "vendor": {"name": "notaryproject"}}], "isExploited": false}
