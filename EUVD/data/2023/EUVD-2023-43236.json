Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `graphs.php` displays graph details such as data-source paths, data template information and graph related fields. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure either a data-source template with malicious code appended in the data-source name or a device with a malicious payload injected in the device name, may deploy a stored XSS attack against any user with _General Administration>Graphs_ privileges. A user that possesses the _Template Editor>Data Templates_ permissions can configure the data-source name in _cacti_. Please note that this may be a _low privileged_ user. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_templates.php` by editing an existing or adding a new data template. If a template is linked to a graph then the formatted template name will be rendered in the graph's management page. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device name in _cacti_. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should add manual HTML escaping.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T20:02:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:03:11", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-6hrc-2cfc-8hm7", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39514"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8e44b5ae-de4b-3b76-8d2a-7e0a08636d12", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ce65957a-b5fb-36b0-a870-f4d97ca99eec", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
