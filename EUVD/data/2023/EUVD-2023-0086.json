When resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working directory, and after that the PATH environment. GitPython defaults to use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a `git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the one in the user's `PATH`. This is more of a problem on how Python interacts with Windows systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected by this. But probably people using GitPython usually run it from the CWD of a repo. An attacker can trick a user to download a repository with a malicious `git` executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython from that directory, it allows the attacker to run any arbitrary commands. There is no fix currently available for windows users, however there are a few mitigations. 1: Default to an absolute path for the git program on Windows, like `C:\\\\\\\\Program Files\\\\\\\\Git\\\\\\\\cmd\\\\\\\\git.EXE` (default git path installation). 2: Require users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable on Windows systems. 3: Make this problem prominent in the documentation and advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path. 4: Resolve the executable manually by only looking into the `PATH` environment variable.", "datePublished": "2023-08-28T09:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2023-09-06T01:26:14", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor", "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4", "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/security/advisories/GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40590", "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1635", "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1636", "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/commit/8b75434e2c8a082cdeb4971cc6f0ee2bafec45bc", "https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/releases/tag/3.1.33", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/gitpython/PYSEC-2023-161.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40590", "GHSA-wfm5-v35h-vwf4", "PYSEC-2023-161"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6f0f8df0-2b29-39ee-87b7-dc276862b291", "product": {"name": "GitPython"}, "product_version": "\u2264 3.1.32"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c90229a-2e6a-3367-9ce1-b0bd5869f78d", "vendor": {"name": "gitpython-developers"}}], "isExploited": false}
