In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 1.6.21 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T20:17:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-06T20:19:54", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs/security/advisories/GHSA-h53w-7qw7-vh5c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34232", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs/pull/465", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs/commit/0c9622ae12cd7d627df404b73a783b4a5f60728a", "https://community.snowflake.com/s/article/Node-js-Driver-Release-Notes", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-nodejs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34232", "GHSA-h53w-7qw7-vh5c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "52b3d897-8867-3994-8d54-29298a232523", "product": {"name": "snowflake-connector-nodejs"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.21"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bdf79d6c-03ac-366f-877c-4bef083c9918", "vendor": {"name": "snowflakedb"}}], "isExploited": false}
