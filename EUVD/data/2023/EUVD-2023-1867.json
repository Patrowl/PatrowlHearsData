Due to use of an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1.\n\nThe code in the function hasNextChunk in the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it wasn\u2019t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false. Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the length of the next chunk.\n\nIn the case that the `compressed` variable is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input data. Since the code doesn\u2019t test the legality of the `chunkSize` variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-06-15T17:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T16:55:35", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34455", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/3bf67857fcf70d9eea56eed4af7c925671e8eaea", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java#L388", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/SnappyInputStream.java", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0009", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230818-0009/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34455", "GHSA-qcwq-55hx-v3vh"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "047efb3f-a313-3a55-9bb3-dce719359c32", "product": {"name": "snappy-java"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4e82b2c5-13a8-368b-ac8d-17f6b5077d9b", "vendor": {"name": "xerial"}}], "isExploited": false}
