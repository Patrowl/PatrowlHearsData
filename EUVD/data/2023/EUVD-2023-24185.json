An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of SSL/TLS traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected error in the hardware-based cryptography engine, which could cause the device to reload.", "datePublished": "2023-06-28T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:57:35", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ssl-dos-uu7mV5p6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20006"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4433b6cd-f994-3a09-beb2-2d1bf1e1fa16", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.16.4"}, {"id": "4c0c42a1-a17c-3337-be52-0a91800af9b9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.18.2.5"}, {"id": "9c9b1c18-4fec-3e6a-9432-21459f673d34", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "9.18.2"}, {"id": "bec40416-55cc-3934-b85c-c4ec9ae5b706", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.2"}, {"id": "d99e828b-d563-3b2f-9cca-e483eb012216", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.1"}, {"id": "dbb5a086-d3ba-322f-891a-1765338dbb60", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "7.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53171f65-5195-31f3-9e78-f7342656da1a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
