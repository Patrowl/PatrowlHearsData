The location of these stored responses is constructed from the URL of the request. Due to insufficient sanitation of the URL, it is possible for an attacker to craft a URL that results in the response being stored outside of the directory specified for it.", "datePublished": "2023-09-13T14:24:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-03T09:51:46", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/routinator/CVE-2023-39916.txt", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39916", "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/pull/892", "https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator/releases/tag/v0.12.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39916"], "assigner": "NLnet Labs", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "24f65fa2-b1aa-3a11-8c0b-d5338fc0d9f3", "product": {"name": "Routinator"}, "product_version": "0.14.*"}, {"id": "5485ed03-35d3-3b62-810b-bb8f1fde5b52", "product": {"name": "Routinator"}, "product_version": "0.9.0 <0.12.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "15825617-9068-3162-8c78-f74141c1415e", "vendor": {"name": "NLnet Labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
