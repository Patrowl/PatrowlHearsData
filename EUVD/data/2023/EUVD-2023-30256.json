Access to this API endpoint is restricted to local networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being executed when processing the request. A check has been introduced to restrict processing of legal and expected classes for this API. We now log a warning in case there are attempts to inject illegal classes. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-20T07:52:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T11:46:24", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6219_7.10.6_2023-03-20.pdf", "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0002.json", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jun/8", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173083/OX-App-Suite-SSRF-Resource-Consumption-Command-Injection.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-26436"], "assigner": "OX", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03532724-88ca-3b16-baa8-e95ebc517230", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22647.10.6-rev7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "59024779-d858-3bb8-a9f8-4fd521936a08", "vendor": {"name": "OX Software GmbH"}}], "isExploited": false}
