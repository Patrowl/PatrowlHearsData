This vulnerability is due to improper reassembly of large packets that occurs when VFR is enabled on either a tunnel interface or on a physical interface that is configured with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) greater than 4,615 bytes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets through a VFR-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2023-03-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:33:06", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv4-vfr-dos-CXxtFacb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20027"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.76, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4e6c7b4f-cc80-3a2f-9abb-e65b590e879e", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f1cdda66-2446-35f4-a670-0bc1961c6ea5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
