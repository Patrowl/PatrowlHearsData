This of course drastically reduces the search space to a linear amount of guesses based on the token length times the possible characters.", "datePublished": "2023-10-31T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-06T18:28:17", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-20110", "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2095", "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/commit/79fe5626cb1bb80f9ac86cf46980748e65d2bdbc", "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/commit/7c49ab3d45dc4921b831a2ca55fb1e2a2db1ee25", "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster", "https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/compare/v2.22.0...v2.23.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2015-20110", "GHSA-4gpm-r23h-gprw"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a1979614-d423-38c2-ae43-b2f5aeec3ff7", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9ea168f-2fe8-3be5-86ca-9a8df6aa3800", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
