These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device and then persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T15:58:34", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-stored-xss-vqz7gC8W"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20150"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9ba1b57c-72d5-30cc-a4b6-0111e8c2755e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a797839b-bf42-3ea5-8bbc-483f389b0c02", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
