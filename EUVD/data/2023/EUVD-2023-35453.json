Contiki-NG contains an implementation of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module `os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c`. The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation (RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the STALE state.\n\nThe message handler does not check for RS messages with an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting pointer is used without a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`.\n\nThe problem has been patched in the `develop` branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in the upcoming 4.9 release. As a workaround, users can apply Contiki-NG pull request #2271 to patch the problem directly.", "datePublished": "2023-05-08T20:51:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-29T14:30:14", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-x29r-5qjg-75mq", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2271"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31129"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "166b1f89-b239-3ded-81dc-7bb954529527", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6dea3d9c-3c9a-3524-9f90-edfe5885f5f4", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
