More specifically, when the client is configured to connect to an IP address (instead of a hostname) it does not validate the server certificate's IP SAN values against that IP address and certificate validation fails, and therefore the connection is not blocked as expected.", "datePublished": "2023-10-26T03:10:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:53:30", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://discuss.elastic.co/t/beats-elastic-agent-apm-server-and-fleet-server-8-10-1-security-update-improper-certificate-validation-issue-esa-2023-16/343385", "https://www.elastic.co/community/security"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-31421"], "assigner": "elastic", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "26cef35a-3f83-3ea3-b300-fe94c93add68", "product": {"name": "Beats"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, 8.9.2"}, {"id": "61953c47-9d86-3a83-97c6-3a3aad05b8d7", "product": {"name": "Fleet Server"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, 8.9.2"}, {"id": "62a7da9b-8f48-3fef-b552-0e485113b876", "product": {"name": "APM Server"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, 8.9.2"}, {"id": "b3aaaa83-ae0a-3b68-a6ed-f6b566333226", "product": {"name": "Elastic Agent"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, 8.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "12b2af15-753b-3b08-a0ba-e520611f11d4", "vendor": {"name": "Elastic"}}], "isExploited": false}
