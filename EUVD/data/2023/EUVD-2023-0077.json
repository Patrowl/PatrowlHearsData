An out-of-bounds write was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-06T17:30:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-26T21:15:17", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-hrw9-ggg3-3r4r", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/commit/e884a0955359107f4031c74a07406df7e99929a5", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-06"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-44398", "GHSA-hrw9-ggg3-3r4r", "PYSEC-2023-233"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "43b27622-13bb-3c45-a439-c6074b720b63", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "= 0.28.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8171fd64-ad48-3b8f-8585-5edfb0c9f0a5", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
