This vulnerability exists because session credentials do not properly expire. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by replaying previously used multifactor authentication (MFA) codes to bypass MFA protection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:30:26", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-duo-replay-knuNKd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20123"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fd575cd7-08c0-37c8-87dd-8bc7ce2f61f5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Duo "}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83e7e794-bb70-3dcc-8347-35c4281b2040", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
