The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are subject to SQL injection in the `data_dictionary.py` `table_info`. User input coming from the `db_name` in and the `tb_name` parameter values in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_info` endpoint is passed to the following methods in the given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution.The methods are `get_table_meta_data ` in `sql/engines/mssql.py` which passes unsafe user input to the `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query` method, `get_table_desc_data` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to the `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query`, `get_table_index_data` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to the `sql/engines/mssql.py` `query` method, `get_table_meta_data` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method, `get_table_desc_data` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method, and `get_table_index_data` in `sql/engines/oracle.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-106`.", "datePublished": "2023-04-18T22:35:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:28:51", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-9pvw-f8jv-xxjr", "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/data_dictionary.py#L47-L86"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-30557"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3ac2099-2a89-3c04-aef4-00196acb5b6e", "product": {"name": "Archery"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f933f3e-3577-3907-a78c-d74b0b712ae4", "vendor": {"name": "hhyo"}}], "isExploited": false}
