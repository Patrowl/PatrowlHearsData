Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The `data_sources.php` script displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. \nCENSUS found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter HTML output.", "datePublished": "2023-09-05T20:42:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:03:01", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-rwhh-xxm6-vcrv", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WZGB2UXJEUYWWA6IWVFQ3ZTP22FIHMGN/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CFH3J2WVBKY4ZJNMARVOWJQK6PSLPHFH/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WOQFYGLZBAWT4AWNMO7DU73QXWPXTCKH/", "https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5550"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39366"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fc364beb-ad22-3d81-b87f-5453c8455680", "product": {"name": "cacti"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.25"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2eedef90-f9e5-3e06-9fc2-84da5e407fdb", "vendor": {"name": "Cacti"}}], "isExploited": false}
