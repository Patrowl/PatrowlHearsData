This vulnerability can only be exploited over the network and the attacker must already have admin/root privileges to carry out the exploit. An authentication bypass is required for this exploit, thereby making it more complex. The attack may not require user interaction. Since an attacker must already be authenticated, the confidentiality impact is low while the integrity and availability impact is high.\u00a0\n\nThis issue affects My Cloud OS 5 devices: before 5.26.300.", "datePublished": "2023-06-30T21:07:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-06T19:48:30", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.westerndigital.com/support/product-security/wdc-23010-my-cloud-firmware-version-5-26-300"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22815"], "assigner": "WDC PSIRT", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69b584b9-dff1-3747-a9f4-e08777287a8c", "product": {"name": "My Cloud OS 5"}, "product_version": "0 <5.26.300"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f62469c-f1ed-315e-8844-b04c57ff157a", "vendor": {"name": "Western Digital"}}], "isExploited": false}
