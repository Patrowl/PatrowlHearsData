KEPServerEX uses OPC UA, a protocol which defines various object types that can be nested to create complex arrays. It does not implement a check to see if such an object is recursively defined, so an attack could send a maliciously created message that the decoder would try to decode until the stack overflowed and the device crashed.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-31T22:53:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-21T18:15:51", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-208-02"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-3825"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "383e649f-b2b0-3f73-821a-c4e7fc7a491c", "product": {"name": "KEPServerEX"}, "product_version": "6.0 \u22646.14.263"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2b63b5ba-b5f6-3c8b-bc8e-0196f8b5e6a1", "vendor": {"name": "PTC"}}], "isExploited": false}
