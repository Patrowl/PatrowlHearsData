Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a\nbuffer overrun in the driver.", "datePublished": "2023-09-22T13:34:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:16:32", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-432.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175963/Kernel-Live-Patch-Security-Notice-LSN-0099-1.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0001/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34319"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bd6cc05a-39ef-3183-ba27-2c7321ca9b3d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd6cc05a-39ef-3183-ba27-2c7321ca9b3d", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
