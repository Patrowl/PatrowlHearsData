A sandbox escape vulnerability exists in vm2 for versions up to and including 3.9.17. It abuses an unexpected creation of a host object based on the specification of `Proxy`. As a result a threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-05-15T19:46:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-22T21:42:31", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32314", "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/commit/d88105f99752305c5b8a77b63ddee3ec86912daf", "https://gist.github.com/arkark/e9f5cf5782dec8321095be3e52acf5ac", "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2", "https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/releases/tag/3.9.18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32314", "GHSA-whpj-8f3w-67p5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 69.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2522a7d9-3079-321d-bf58-a18d02aacb86", "product": {"name": "vm2"}, "product_version": "< 3.9.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9355c1d3-029c-3a51-b332-8634c171359b", "vendor": {"name": "patriksimek"}}], "isExploited": false}
