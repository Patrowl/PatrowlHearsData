An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete policies created by users associated with a different security domain. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.", "datePublished": "2023-08-23T18:21:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-01T15:53:16", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apic-uapa-F4TAShk"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20230"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2434467d-13f3-3e68-921c-2c49cda8b470", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "5.2(6g)"}, {"id": "3e3a3e7d-1bc1-3ecf-8b8c-c0d846721819", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "6.0(1j)"}, {"id": "5b6bf7f4-5221-3327-aca1-2384f4f2d3e0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "5.2(6e)"}, {"id": "72c54219-14b1-3298-aec4-d0113dd4e5d4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "6.0(2h)"}, {"id": "a0b1f3b7-057b-3f57-b539-9630a3a7884c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "6.0(2j)"}, {"id": "a96201cc-db18-3b0e-87d4-383f7e17cf50", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "5.2(7g)"}, {"id": "d4fa3c46-052a-3b1c-879c-18d71c28e434", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "6.0(1g)"}, {"id": "e91118c0-d8af-331c-8b8c-f05d1a2f4025", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "5.2(7f)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25a2f0e1-06bc-3569-b144-f8260fa61ef2", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
