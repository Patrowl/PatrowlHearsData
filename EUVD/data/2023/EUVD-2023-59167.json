This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include remote files on the server, resulting in code execution. NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the target server's php.ini is configured with 'allow_url_include' set to 'on'. This feature is deprecated as of PHP 7.4 and is disabled by default, but can still be explicitly enabled in later versions of PHP.", "datePublished": "2023-12-23T01:59:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:50:06", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b380283c-0dbb-4d67-9f66-cb7c400c0427?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/backup-backup/tags/1.3.9/includes/backup-heart.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3012745/backup-backup"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6971"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 9.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "53e765b5-fe67-3f1d-9830-a72c84cc8daa", "product": {"name": "Backup Migration"}}, {"id": "9161ff24-d1da-3d1c-a590-30fbb6d7db68", "product": {"name": "Backup Migration"}, "product_version": "1.0.8 \u22641.3.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e44909d4-4ee3-3032-90d7-8952387c69fd", "vendor": {"name": "migrate"}}], "isExploited": false}
