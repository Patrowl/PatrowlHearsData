Header\n\n2. Data\n\nWhen a connection is made, the server is waiting for 4 bytes of data, which will be the header,\nand these 4 bytes would be parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to come.\n\nThen, in the function \u201chandleRequest\u201d this size is then used in order to allocate a payload on\nthe stack for the incoming data.\n\nAs this payload is allocated on the stack, this will allow overflowing the stack size allocated for\nthe relevant process with freely controlled data.\n\n* An attacker can crash the system. \n* An attacker can gain control over the system, specifically on the \u201cvtpm_server\u201d process\nwhich has very high privileges.\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-09-21T13:13:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-24T17:09:26", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://asrg.io/security-advisories/cve-2023-43632/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-43632"], "assigner": "ASRG", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a1e62b69-5863-3eea-ab1c-5154d410dba1", "product": {"name": "EVE OS"}, "product_version": "3.0.0 <9.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5360481d-760f-316c-b1e5-878b69aa320d", "vendor": {"name": " LF-Edge, Zededa"}}], "isExploited": false}
