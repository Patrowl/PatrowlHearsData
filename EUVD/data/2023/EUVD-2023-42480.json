SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This vulnerability\u2019s impact may range from unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.", "datePublished": "2023-10-06T13:46:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:02:32", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/security/advisories/GHSA-f76w-fh7c-pc66", "https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/6dc9b8c181aff39845f02b4626e0812820d4ef0d", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00019.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-38703"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8c95abe3-bff2-319a-b9ff-e758a36eb35f", "product": {"name": "pjproject"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.13.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "33919bdb-b528-3fd8-92d1-b69d5250f5ac", "vendor": {"name": "pjsip"}}], "isExploited": false}
