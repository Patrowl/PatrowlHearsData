If it is built to use the synchronous resolver, it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using `alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`. When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or otherwise misbehave.", "datePublished": "2023-05-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-15T15:59:07", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/1929597", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28320"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0315f9d5-f476-385d-ad7b-6613f24fe282", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
