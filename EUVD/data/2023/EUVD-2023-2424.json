The SnappyInputStream was found to be vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks when decompressing data with a too large chunk size. Due to missing upper bound check on chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur. All versions of snappy-java including the latest released version 1.1.10.3 are vulnerable to this issue. A fix has been introduced in commit `9f8c3cf74` which will be included in the 1.1.10.4 release. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only accept compressed data from trusted sources.", "datePublished": "2023-09-25T19:03:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-24T15:26:53", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43642", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/9f8c3cf74223ed0a8a834134be9c917b9f10ceb5", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java", "https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/releases/tag/v1.1.10.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-43642", "GHSA-55g7-9cwv-5qfv"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ce081976-9c16-31be-aa9f-5f0de0537aa7", "product": {"name": "snappy-java"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.10.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0dd566c5-f940-39e2-acbb-9022e77ff9eb", "vendor": {"name": "xerial"}}], "isExploited": false}
