XWiki is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (RXSS) via the `rev` parameter that is used in the content of the content menu without escaping. If an attacker can convince a user to visit a link with a crafted parameter, this allows the attacker to execute arbitrary actions in the name of the user, including remote code (Groovy) execution in the case of a user with programming right, compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 15.6 RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.14. The patch in commit `04e325d57` can be manually applied without upgrading (or restarting) the instance. Users are advised to upgrade or to manually apply the patch. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-11-06T18:45:03", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-05T13:31:18", "baseScore": 9.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-j9rc-w3wv-fv62", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46732", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/04e325d57d4bcb6ab79bddcafbb19032474c2a55", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21095"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46732", "GHSA-j9rc-w3wv-fv62"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 43.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "751e471a-2fe4-3437-94ce-70a4dfd8e235", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "15.0-rc-1, < 15.5.1"}, {"id": "f18e8365-fcf2-3dc1-b80a-c616859a8448", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "9.7-rc-1, < 14.10.14"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "64abeb67-1438-3cbd-96d1-66ce4a14a5b4", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
