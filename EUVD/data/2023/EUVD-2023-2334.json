In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-08-10T17:39:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-04T18:57:45", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/security/advisories/GHSA-pv7q-v9mv-9mh5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39964", "https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel", "https://github.com/1Panel-dev/1Panel/releases/tag/v1.5.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-39964", "GHSA-pv7q-v9mv-9mh5"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "439ab63d-5a5a-368b-b449-e11a7c326a2f", "product": {"name": "1Panel"}, "product_version": "= 1.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "399e054b-9e90-3f5c-ad3e-d48d4fdffb14", "vendor": {"name": "1Panel-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
