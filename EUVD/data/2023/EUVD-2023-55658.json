An attacker can trigger out-of-bounds reads in the RPL-Lite implementation of the RPL protocol in the Contiki-NG operating system. This vulnerability is caused by insufficient control of the lengths for DIO and DAO messages, in particular when they contain RPL sub-option headers. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG 4.9. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually apply the code changes in PR #2484.", "datePublished": "2024-02-14T19:22:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-24T15:15:35", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-9423-rgj4-wjfw", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2484"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-50927"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "63bb7562-d87f-3f80-a9e3-561081090e00", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}, {"id": "c14b0263-6e6c-3211-83e7-4d0d6bf6a94a", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "< 4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "63bb7562-d87f-3f80-a9e3-561081090e00", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
