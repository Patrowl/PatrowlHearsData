To exploit this vulnerability, a malicious user would have to convince a user to click on an untrusted link through a social engineering attack or successfully perform a Cross Site Scripting Attack (XSS). Exploitation of a CSRF could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure and full remote access to the affected products.\n\n\n\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-07-11T13:15:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-07T17:27:54", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1139760"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-2746"], "assigner": "Rockwell", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82953a94-3f49-339c-889a-8264100f23b3", "product": {"name": "Enhanced HIM"}, "product_version": "v1.001"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8a0bc69d-0e5d-3a2b-b3ff-9fb64636b854", "vendor": {"name": "Rockwell Automation"}}], "isExploited": false}
