Versions prior to 0.29.0.gfm.7 are subject to several polynomial time complexity issues in cmark-gfm that may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. Various commands, when piped to cmark-gfm with large values, cause the running time to increase quadratically. These vulnerabilities have been patched in version 0.29.0.gfm.7.\n", "datePublished": "2023-01-23T22:36:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T10:13:48", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-22483.html", "https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm/security/advisories/GHSA-29g3-96g3-jg6c"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-22483"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "820b8705-cb16-3411-b891-6a29da05c35b", "product": {"name": "cmark-gfm"}, "product_version": "<  0.29.0.gfm.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da34822c-bfb7-3ed6-bcad-0039b3166f30", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
