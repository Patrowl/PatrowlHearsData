As this action will cause console\nmessages to be issued on the other side quite often, the chance of\ntriggering the deadlock is not neglectable.\n\nNote that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the 32-bit Linux kernel\non Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are required to trigger the\nissue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block further readers to get\nthe lock).", "datePublished": "2024-01-05T16:30:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T19:16:37", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-441.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00004.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00005.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34324"], "assigner": "XEN", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f5c1b03-f966-32e9-9ed2-f77b50957c9a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1f5c1b03-f966-32e9-9ed2-f77b50957c9a", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
