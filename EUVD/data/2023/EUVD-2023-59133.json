The vulnerability is specific to static RSA cipher suites, and expected to be padding-independent.\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forge signatures after probing with a large number of test observations. However the server\u2019s private key is not exposed.\n", "datePublished": "2024-02-09T22:25:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T08:42:08", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/", "https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/security-vulnerabilities/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6935"], "assigner": "wolfSSL", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2f92d306-85b2-3b2d-ba3c-8dc6cd749954", "product": {"name": "wolfSSL"}, "product_version": "3.12.2 \u22645.6.4"}, {"id": "dcd979ed-d898-317b-9548-c21b3fc84002", "product": {"name": "wolfSSL"}}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dcd979ed-d898-317b-9548-c21b3fc84002", "vendor": {"name": "wolfSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
