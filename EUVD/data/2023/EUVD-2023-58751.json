This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the send_backup_codes_email function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with arbitrary content to registered users via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator or other registered user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. While a nonce check is present, it is only executed if a nonce is set. By omitting a nonce from the request, the check can be bypassed.", "datePublished": "2024-01-11T06:49:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-09T18:40:03", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0af451be-2477-453c-a230-7f3fb804398b?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-2fa/trunk/includes/classes/Admin/class-setup-wizard.php?rev=2940688#L606", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3009922%40wp-2fa&new=3009922%40wp-2fa&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-6520"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e89cd254-fd5b-3382-893e-f10b8ea61af0", "product": {"name": "WP 2FA \u2013 Two-factor authentication for WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c654e9fc-6df6-322f-83ec-63c9491c6f38", "vendor": {"name": "Melapress"}}], "isExploited": false}
