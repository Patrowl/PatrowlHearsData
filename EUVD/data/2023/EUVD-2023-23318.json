This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to get post listings by category as long as those posts are published. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce being accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role.", "datePublished": "2023-02-28T12:55:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-13T17:03:38", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2870465/wp-meta-seo/trunk?contextall=1&old=2869205&old_path=%2Fwp-meta-seo%2Ftrunk#file2", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2870465%40wp-meta-seo&new=2870465%40wp-meta-seo&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/978d5715-7993-4f89-8d69-895467633bfb"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-1026"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8ed2c54e-3023-38c6-b40c-a4f339639264", "product": {"name": "WP Meta SEO"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.5.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9d41e559-dc60-3c79-bb51-c62f8a60c728", "vendor": {"name": "JoomUnited"}}], "isExploited": false}
