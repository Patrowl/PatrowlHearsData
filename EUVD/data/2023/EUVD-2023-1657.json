In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T20:29:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-06T19:28:28", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/security/advisories/GHSA-223g-8w3x-98wr", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34230", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34230", "GHSA-223g-8w3x-98wr"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.79, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a172d04d-f840-3316-92f2-c818830b9389", "product": {"name": "snowflake-connector-net"}, "product_version": "< 2.0.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6470bc87-d9d1-3a8a-8ef7-57880f69218f", "vendor": {"name": "snowflakedb"}}], "isExploited": false}
