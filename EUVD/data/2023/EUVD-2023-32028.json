This private wildcard matching function would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and could as a result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch. IDN hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate checks. Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even resembling an `x`.", "datePublished": "2023-05-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-15T15:54:33", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/1950627", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230609-0009/", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213843", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213844", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213845", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/52", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/48", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jul/47", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-12", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00016.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/F4I75RDGX5ULSSCBE5BF3P5I5SFO7ULQ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z2LIWHWKOVH24COGGBCVOWDXXIUPKOMK/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-28321"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d3c008de-e68e-3d51-aa51-c9c50b9b18e1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
