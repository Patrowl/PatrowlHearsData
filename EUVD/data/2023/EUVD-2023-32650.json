Some connections use user-controlled endpoints, which could be malicious and attempt to keep the connection open for an extended period of time. As a result users were able to trigger large amount of egress network connections, possibly exhausting network pool resources and lock up legitimate requests. A new mechanism has been introduced to cancel external connections that might access user-controlled endpoints. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-11-02T13:01:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T14:00:14", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://software.open-xchange.com/products/appsuite/doc/Release_Notes_for_Patch_Release_6243_7.10.6_2023-08-01.pdf", "https://documentation.open-xchange.com/appsuite/security/advisories/csaf/2023/oxas-adv-2023-0004.json"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-29046"], "assigner": "OX", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3af61dfa-e2f3-32c0-b3e6-59a7fb542e49", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22647.10.6-rev48"}, {"id": "ac9d5153-0212-3840-b254-c38a44e65e32", "product": {"name": "OX App Suite"}, "product_version": "0 \u22648.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "72f5b7cd-934b-35f8-89e0-08d52682b18e", "vendor": {"name": "OX Software GmbH"}}], "isExploited": false}
