This vulnerability can be exploited in two ways. If an attacker sends a malicious link to a computer that is on the same domain as the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server and a user clicks the link, the attacker could impersonate the legitimate user and send requests to the affected product.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, if an attacker sends an untrusted link to a computer that is not on the same domain as the server and a user opens the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint website, enters credentials for the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server, and clicks on the malicious link a cross site request forgery attack would be successful as well.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-05-11T18:12:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-24T21:16:59", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1139443"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-2444"], "assigner": "Rockwell", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "477967d9-f620-3a24-bdaa-82f3d12d5fb2", "product": {"name": "FactoryTalk Vantagepoint"}, "product_version": "<v8.40"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1cca6c16-ed69-3a0a-b499-61e480e76072", "vendor": {"name": "Rockwell Automation"}}], "isExploited": false}
