A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in affected versions allows clicking on a link in a PDF in an untrusted note to execute arbitrary shell commands. Clicking links in PDFs allows for arbitrary code execution because Joplin desktop: 1. has not disabled top redirection for note viewer iframes, and 2. and has node integration enabled. This is a remote code execution vulnerability that impacts anyone who attaches untrusted PDFs to notes and has the icon enabled. This issue has been addressed in version 2.13.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2024-06-21T19:38:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T20:21:16", "baseScore": 8.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-g8qx-5vcm-3x59", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-45673"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 2.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ded64590-5253-32de-ba70-a38d7b36ac2e", "product": {"name": "joplin"}, "product_version": "< 2.13.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5dfff292-d60d-3721-90a8-ea709f7b52f4", "vendor": {"name": "laurent22"}}], "isExploited": false}
