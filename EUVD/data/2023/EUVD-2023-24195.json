This vulnerability is due to a weakness in the encryption method used for the backup function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a static key used for the backup configuration feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive information that is stored in full state and configuration backup files, such as local user credentials, authentication server passwords, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community names, and other credentials.", "datePublished": "2023-02-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-25T16:04:01", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ucsm-bkpsky-H8FCQgsA"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20016"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1b49199e-18cb-383b-b641-66eed7deb04c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9157f3f1-40d1-3ba8-a3e9-6a9e0788a4d1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
