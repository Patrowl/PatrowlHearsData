A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`. 2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to `TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected, arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR #7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller >= 5.13.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2023-12-09T00:42:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:18:55", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/security/advisories/GHSA-9w2p-rh8c-v9g5", "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pull/7827", "https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/pull/7827", "https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0fb18b02c8ad56299d6a2910be0bab8ad601ef24/Lib/shutil.py#L623", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ISRWT34FAF23PUOLVZ7RVWBZMWPDR5U7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2K2XIQLEMZIKUQUOWNDYWTEWYQTKMAN7/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-49797", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/pyinstaller/PYSEC-2023-292.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-49797", "GHSA-9w2p-rh8c-v9g5", "PYSEC-2023-292"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f08e2863-691f-3198-80df-52a1a836d11c", "product": {"name": "PyInstaller"}, "product_version": "< 5.13.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e8aaec0-4052-39a5-915f-c79db15540f5", "vendor": {"name": "PyInstaller"}}], "isExploited": false}
