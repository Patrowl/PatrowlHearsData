An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically, the prefix information of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated, which means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum prefix length. Subsequently, a memcmp function call that compares different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix, causing an out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release. Users are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2721.", "datePublished": "2024-02-14T19:28:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T22:23:44", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/security/advisories/GHSA-jp4p-fq85-jch2", "https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/2721"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-50926"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2e07e760-d255-306f-8983-9d0e300040eb", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}, {"id": "8f961798-ac2d-31d6-9002-3d0a708c7912", "product": {"name": "contiki-ng"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2e07e760-d255-306f-8983-9d0e300040eb", "vendor": {"name": "contiki-ng"}}], "isExploited": false}
