Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles could lead to a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when a site has content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-encrypt installed will result in a warning in the Discourse admin dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9` which is included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP headers are enabled and properly configured.", "datePublished": "2023-09-28T18:04:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-23T18:21:57", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/security/advisories/GHSA-5fh6-wp7p-xx7v", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-encrypt/commit/9c75810af9a474d7edaec67dea66f852c0ba1f4e", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-43657"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ed0883f7-9958-37d9-baa3-8bc5c48f1d2b", "product": {"name": "discourse-encrypt"}, "product_version": "\u2264 c492904c"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2924c205-031a-3c2a-9c97-cabf026ed8be", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
