Custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is disabled globally (_Admin CP \u2192 Configuration \u2192 Settings \u2192 Clickable Smilies and BB Code: [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_ is set to _Off_), or 2. the visual editor is disabled for individual user accounts (_User CP \u2192 Your Profile \u2192 Edit Options_: _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_ checkbox is not checked). MyBB 1.8.37 resolves this issue with the commit `6dcaf0b4d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the impact without upgrading MyBB by changing the following setting (_Admin CP \u2192 Configuration \u2192 Settings_):\n- _Clickable Smilies and BB Code \u2192 [Clickable MyCode Editor](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1836/install/resources/settings.xml#L2087-L2094)_: _Off_. Similarly, individual MyBB forum users are able to disable the visual editor by diabling the account option (_User CP \u2192 Your Profile \u2192 Edit Options_) _Show the MyCode formatting options on the posting pages_.", "datePublished": "2023-11-06T17:41:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-04T19:32:41", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-wj33-q7vj-9fr8", "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6dcaf0b4db6254f1833fe8dae295d9ddc2219276", "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.37/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-46251"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "579ff7dd-522f-31db-a562-c82d2b9d0394", "product": {"name": "MyBB"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.37"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7834e22d-e406-3d9d-a2c4-5e04a7c92cf3", "vendor": {"name": "MyBB"}}], "isExploited": false}
