Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. \u200bThe `checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length.", "datePublished": "2023-05-30T18:59:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-10T16:51:37", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/security/advisories/GHSA-qffq-8gf8-mhq7", "https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/commit/c59e381d368990214813085a1a4877c5ef865411"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32699"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f2aeaf76-b821-3356-bb38-275c08c9cb31", "product": {"name": "metersphere"}, "product_version": "< 2.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b1499f86-2fac-3a39-803c-d0d2da5317b1", "vendor": {"name": "metersphere"}}], "isExploited": false}
