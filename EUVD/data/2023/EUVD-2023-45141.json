Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls. In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.\n\n", "datePublished": "2023-08-25T20:27:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-02T17:37:31", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-hjwj-4f3q-44h3", "https://github.com/dream0x01/weblogic-framework/releases/tag/v0.2.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-40571"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "53b40c08-e986-3d49-91a9-995094214cb4", "product": {"name": "weblogic-framework"}, "product_version": "< 0.2.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "038c6922-bb01-3105-a1f7-71657b152979", "vendor": {"name": "dream0x01"}}], "isExploited": false}
