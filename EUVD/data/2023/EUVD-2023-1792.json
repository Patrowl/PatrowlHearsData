Prior to version 1.6.19, a command injection vulnerability exists in the Snowflake Golang driver via single sign-on (SSO) browser URL authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. A patch is available in version 1.6.19.", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:42:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-06T19:45:43", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/security/advisories/GHSA-fwv2-65wh-2w8c", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34231", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/pull/757", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake/commit/e11a2a555f1b9f7adc1f01fb7b5e7f38fbbb2a1c", "https://github.com/snowflakedb/gosnowflake"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34231", "GHSA-fwv2-65wh-2w8c"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "710cf44a-eee3-3acb-afb5-39ebaf8cb3bc", "product": {"name": "gosnowflake"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d3e46529-6755-3a64-a632-edbc62d1bbc7", "vendor": {"name": "snowflakedb"}}], "isExploited": false}
