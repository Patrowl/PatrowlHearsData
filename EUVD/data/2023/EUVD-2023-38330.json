In affected versions if a Windows user was registered in tgstation-server (TGS), an attacker could discover their username by brute-forcing the login endpoint with an invalid password. When a valid Windows logon was found, a distinct response would be generated. This issue has been addressed in version 5.12.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may be mitigated by rate-limiting API calls with software that sits in front of TGS in the HTTP pipeline such as fail2ban.", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T21:09:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-06T19:27:20", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/security/advisories/GHSA-w3jx-4x93-76ph", "https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server/pull/1526"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-34243"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2b3b8c8-62b4-3a88-b29d-4c371d2b603b", "product": {"name": "tgstation-server"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 5.12.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e8981862-10dc-3f45-8716-ee289553d845", "vendor": {"name": "tgstation"}}], "isExploited": false}
