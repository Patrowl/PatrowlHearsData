The vm-memory rust crate provides a set of traits to decouple VM memory consumers from VM memory providers. An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function\u2019s `count` argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory` are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s documentation. The issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the `VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.", "datePublished": "2023-09-01T18:22:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T17:08:47", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/security/advisories/GHSA-49hh-fprx-m68g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-41051", "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/issues/250", "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/commit/aff1dd4a5259f7deba56692840f7a2d9ca34c9c8", "https://crates.io/crates/vm-memory/0.12.2", "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IPXRXD5VXBZHBGMUM77B52CJJMG7EJGI", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYM6CYW2DWRHRAVL2HYTQPXC3J2V77J4", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XZGJL6BQLU4XCPQLLTW4GSSBTNQXB3TI", "https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0056.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XZGJL6BQLU4XCPQLLTW4GSSBTNQXB3TI/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IPXRXD5VXBZHBGMUM77B52CJJMG7EJGI/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SYM6CYW2DWRHRAVL2HYTQPXC3J2V77J4/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-41051", "GHSA-49hh-fprx-m68g"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8e200245-a618-30e3-a60c-bdc92a23317c", "product": {"name": "vm-memory"}, "product_version": "0.1.0, < 0.12.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f0fecd9c-8257-366d-9cb4-a906074d23e3", "vendor": {"name": "rust-vmm"}}], "isExploited": false}
