This vulnerability is due to the VPP improperly handling a malformed packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packet over an IPsec connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to stop ICMP traffic over an IPsec connection and cause a denial of service (DoS).", "datePublished": "2023-04-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-10-28T16:31:14", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cisco-pdng-dos-KmzwEy2Q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-20051"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ad3e8eb7-aeab-3e1f-8e9a-52b49d43a702", "product": {"name": "Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f08d6ac3-6240-3ece-99eb-4d7951e299ed", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
