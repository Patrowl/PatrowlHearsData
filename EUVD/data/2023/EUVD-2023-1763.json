An attacker who has compromised a registry and added a high number of signatures to an artifact can cause denial of service of services on the machine, if a user runs notation inspect command on the same machine. The problem has been fixed in the release v1.0.0-rc.6. Users should upgrade their notation packages to v1.0.0-rc.6 or above. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may restrict container registries to a set of secure and trusted container registries.", "datePublished": "2023-06-06T18:10:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T15:54:14", "baseScore": 2.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/security/advisories/GHSA-9m3v-v4r5-ppx7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-33957", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/commit/ed22fde52f6d70ae0b53521bd28c9ccafa868c24", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-33957", "GHSA-9m3v-v4r5-ppx7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1852fc3e-cca7-39fb-ba76-fb62e41653c2", "product": {"name": "notation"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.0-rc.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "40aa1a03-4221-3124-8218-7ec277c68947", "vendor": {"name": "notaryproject"}}], "isExploited": false}
