Fix it up.\n\nThe context based search manages the spinlocking around the search\ninternally. So it needs to grab the reference count internally as\nwell. The execlist only request based search relies on external\nlocking, so it needs an external reference count but within the\nspinlock not outside it.\n\nThe only other caller of the context based search is the code for\ndumping engine state to debugfs. That code wasn't previously getting\nan explicit reference at all as it does everything while holding the\nexeclist specific spinlock. So, that needs updaing as well as that\nspinlock doesn't help when using GuC submission. Rather than trying to\nconditionally get/put depending on submission model, just change it to\nalways do the get/put.\n\nv2: Explicitly document adding an extra blank line in some dense code\n(Andy Shevchenko). Fix multiple potential null pointer derefs in case\nof no request found (some spotted by Tvrtko, but there was more!).\nAlso fix a leaked request in case of !started and another in\n__guc_reset_context now that intel_context_find_active_request is\nactually reference counting the returned request.\nv3: Add a _get suffix to intel_context_find_active_request now that it\ngrabs a reference (Daniele).\nv4: Split the intel_guc_find_hung_context change to a separate patch\nand rename intel_context_find_active_request_get to\nintel_context_get_active_request (Tvrtko).\nv5: s/locking/reference counting/ in commit message (Tvrtko)\n\n(cherry picked from commit 3700e353781e27f1bc7222f51f2cc36cbeb9b4ec)", "datePublished": "2025-03-27T18:31:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-28T18:30:24", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9467397f417dd7b5d0db91452f0474e79716a527", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86d8ddc74124c3fdfc139f246ba6da15e45e86e3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52981"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-52981"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d488897-085b-3a21-baff-aca63641df66", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.15"}, {"id": "52810b96-d0d4-36a3-a82a-446a5bb90d5d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "573ba126aef37c8315e5bb68d2dad515efa96994 <9467397f417dd7b5d0db91452f0474e79716a527"}, {"id": "5b51c4c4-f428-33df-8ae5-44262a9316be", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "573ba126aef37c8315e5bb68d2dad515efa96994 <86d8ddc74124c3fdfc139f246ba6da15e45e86e3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "807a424b-9bca-3ea3-9c68-5d4bdf9c7ab6", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
