Users of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable docker image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended. This issue has been addressed in commit `3ba4b665b` which has been included in dockerspawner release version 13. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should explicitly set `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior.", "datePublished": "2023-12-08T20:08:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-02T21:23:39", "baseScore": 8.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/security/advisories/GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48311", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner/commit/3ba4b665b6ca6027ea7a032d7ca3eab977574626", "https://github.com/jupyterhub/dockerspawner"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-48311", "GHSA-hfgr-h3vc-p6c2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82e16d5f-d3a2-3162-813e-b4dd1f091dc8", "product": {"name": "dockerspawner"}, "product_version": "0.11.0, < 13.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fc6b9c10-d537-3d51-ae53-a5069c0b25fe", "vendor": {"name": "jupyterhub"}}], "isExploited": false}
