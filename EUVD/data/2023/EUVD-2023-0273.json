In contracts with more than one regular nonpayable function, it is possible to send funds to the default function, even if the default function is marked `nonpayable`. This applies to contracts compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T19:46:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T16:36:34", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-vxmm-cwh2-q762", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-vxmm-cwh2-q762", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-vxmm-cwh2-q762", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/02339dfda0f3caabad142060d511d10bfe93c520.", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32675", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/903727006c1e5ebef99fa9fd5d51d62bd33d72a9", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/vyper/PYSEC-2023-80.yaml"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-32675", "GHSA-vxmm-cwh2-q762", "PYSEC-2023-80"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2071d517-9d42-345d-957d-ebe1ac6d1e7c", "product": {"name": "vyper"}, "product_version": "< 0.3.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f04bce63-aadf-3379-9644-af6d5623dba6", "vendor": {"name": "vyperlang"}}], "isExploited": false}
