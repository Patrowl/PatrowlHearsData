NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.  It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.", "datePublished": "2007-03-26T23:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T13:06:25", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934864", "http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=2517", "http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/isn/2007-q1/0418.html", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/1115", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/33244", "http://news.com.com/Windows+weakness+can+lead+to+network+traffic+hijacks/2100-1002_3-6170229.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2007-1692"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 28.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "88c4dfea-9be3-3362-a0f5-dc7e4328f38a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1f9a006d-16cd-3d1c-9958-6ae2f02b8c1b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
