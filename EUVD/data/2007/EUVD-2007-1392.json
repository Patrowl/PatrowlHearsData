NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design limitation of PHP and that only the misuse of this feature, i.e. implementation bugs in applications, should be included in CVE. However, it has been fixed by the vendor.", "datePublished": "2007-03-10T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T12:50:35", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-1396.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/462263/100/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/462800/100/0/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/26048", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/22886", "http://us2.php.net/releases/4_4_7.php", "http://securityreason.com/securityalert/2406", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/462457/100/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/462658/100/0/threaded", "http://us2.php.net/releases/5_2_2.php", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2007-07/msg00006.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2007-1396"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "39723078-d320-36b3-b458-cefcab8e1a36", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "56b257f6-9669-3934-962d-fedd0f8d1a9b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
