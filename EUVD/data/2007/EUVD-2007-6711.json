NOTE: this is a preliminary CVE for Dual_EC_DRBG; future research may provide additional details about point Q and associated attacks, and could potentially lead to a RECAST or REJECT of this CVE.", "datePublished": "2013-10-11T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T16:18:20", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6755.html", "http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html", "http://stream.wsj.com/story/latest-headlines/SS-2-63399/SS-2-332655/", "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/11/the_strange_sto.html", "http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html", "http://threatpost.com/in-wake-of-latest-crypto-revelations-everything-is-suspect", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/63657", "http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/stop-using-nsa-influence-code-in-our-product-rsa-tells-customers/", "http://rump2007.cr.yp.to/15-shumow.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2007-6755"], "assigner": "oracle", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c0054023-87fd-3e0c-a5d5-26e3a2424453", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "569311f2-a49a-354d-b4cc-93f332827a83", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
