This could be achieved by adding an action to the launcher and updating it with new callbacks until the libunity-webapps rate limit was hit. Fixed in 3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1 of unity-firefox-extension and in all versions of libunity-webapps by shipping an empty unity-firefox-extension package, thus disabling the extension entirely and invalidating the attack against the libunity-webapps package.", "datePublished": "2021-04-07T19:20:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T21:08:08", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://ubuntu.com/USN-2743-3", "https://launchpad.net/bugs/1175691"], "aliases": ["CVE-2013-1055"], "assigner": "canonical", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9b386d2b-a923-3893-9e08-77b633da8235", "product": {"name": "unity-firefox-extension"}, "product_version": "3.0.0 <3.0.0+14.04.20140416-0ubuntu1.14.04.1"}, {"id": "b7efdb66-77f9-3983-bc5f-4acc775ad34f", "product": {"name": "libunity-webapps"}, "product_version": "2.5.0 <2.5.0~+14.04.20140409-0ubuntu1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa893724-71ec-3d71-a11e-c30128f3e0eb", "vendor": {"name": "Canonical"}}], "isExploited": false}
