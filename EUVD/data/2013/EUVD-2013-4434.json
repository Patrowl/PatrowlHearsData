{"id": "EUVD-2013-4434", "enisaUuid": "4e2738fa-5eec-39c4-bba6-9d349df672bb", "description": "GnuPG 1.x before 1.4.16 generates RSA keys using sequences of introductions with certain patterns that introduce a side channel, which allows physically proximate attackers to extract RSA keys via a chosen-ciphertext attack and acoustic cryptanalysis during decryption. NOTE: applications are not typically expected to protect themselves from acoustic side-channel attacks, since this is arguably the responsibility of the physical device. Accordingly, issues of this type would not normally receive a CVE identifier. However, for this issue, the developer has specified a security policy in which GnuPG should offer side-channel resistance, and developer-specified security-policy violations are within the scope of CVE.", "datePublished": "2013-12-20T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-06T16:45:14", "baseScore": 2.1, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4576.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2013/dsa-2821", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014:0016", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2013-4576.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2013-4576.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2013-4576.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/64424", "http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-2059-1", "http://osvdb.org/101170", "http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-devel/2013-December/028102.html", "http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0016.html", "http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1029513", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/89846", "http://www.debian.org/security/2013/dsa-2821", "http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/acoustic-20131218.pdf", "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/523", "http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/", "http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/520"], "aliases": ["CVE-2013-4576"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5f683c5d-d469-3b64-9ad4-8bb0b78c3901", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75360e1c-f5a1-32c0-8945-cc3cc187c5a7", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
