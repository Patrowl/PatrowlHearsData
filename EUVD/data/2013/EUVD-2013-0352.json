NOTE: it could be argued that because expat already provides the ability to disable external entity expansion, the responsibility for resolving this issue lies with application developers; according to this argument, this entry should be REJECTed, and each affected application would need its own CVE.", "datePublished": "2022-05-05T02:48:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-25T18:32:00", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0340.html", "http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/22/3", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/12/6", "http://www.osvdb.org/90634", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1028213", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-21", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/58233", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212805", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212804", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212807", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212819", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212814", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT212815", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/33", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/34", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/40", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/35", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/38", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Sep/39", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r41eca5f4f09e74436cbb05dec450fc2bef37b5d3e966aa7cc5fada6d%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfb2c193360436e230b85547e85a41bea0916916f96c501f5b6fc4702%40%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/4", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/62", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/63", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2021/Oct/61", "https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_4_1/expat/Changes", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-0340", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r41eca5f4f09e74436cbb05dec450fc2bef37b5d3e966aa7cc5fada6d@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rfb2c193360436e230b85547e85a41bea0916916f96c501f5b6fc4702@%3Cusers.openoffice.apache.org%3E"], "aliases": ["CVE-2013-0340"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cd3c8365-5f60-3e71-9ddc-d77f8b32f300", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0c70b391-bb5b-3ba3-947c-7ace3284a132", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
