This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "datePublished": "2025-08-09T13:45:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-11T15:52:22", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5da295f3-ac54-4330-ac39-65225adeb93a?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/the7-responsive-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/5556590", "https://themeforest.net/item/the7-responsive-multipurpose-wordpress-theme/5556590#item-description__recent-updates", "https://the7.io/changelog/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7726"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "74f83174-a173-3bab-9575-f43ef5ee3c5c", "product": {"name": "The7 \u2014 Website and eCommerce Builder for WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u226412.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ab5c2da0-67d3-3249-b467-770ff8fc88a1", "vendor": {"name": "Dream-Theme"}}], "isExploited": false}
