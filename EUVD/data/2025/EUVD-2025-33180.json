In versions prior to 2.5.3 and 2.2.15, `Deno.FsFile.prototype.stat` and `Deno.FsFile.prototype.statSync` are not limited by the permission model check `--deny-read=./`. It's possible to retrieve stats from files that the user do not have explicit read access to (the script is executed with `--deny-read=./`). Similar APIs like `Deno.stat` and `Deno.statSync` require\u00a0`allow-read`\u00a0permission, however, when a file is opened, even with file-write only flags and deny-read permission, it's still possible to retrieve file stats, and thus bypass the permission model. Versions 2.5.3 and 2.2.15 fix the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-10-08T00:49:42", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-08T18:54:33", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/denoland/deno/security/advisories/GHSA-qq26-84mh-26j9", "https://github.com/denoland/deno/pull/30876", "https://github.com/denoland/deno/commit/1ab2268c0bcbf9b0468e0e36963f77f8c31c73ec", "https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.2.15", "https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.5.3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61786"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61786"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "25140f4b-f054-32cf-8f07-77639f32928d", "product": {"name": "deno"}, "product_version": "2.3.0, < 2.5.3"}, {"id": "52ae827f-9a80-3fbf-892e-d419de5e6d97", "product": {"name": "deno"}, "product_version": "< 2.2.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "055e2bf6-4692-319c-9c1e-92311e1708ce", "vendor": {"name": "denoland"}}], "isExploited": false}
