In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043.", "datePublished": "2025-01-20T22:53:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-14T10:03:09", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-j3g9-wg22-v955", "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9d1bed5eccdbb46a26b8a484f5e9163c40e63919"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24014"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ae77fe1f-53d3-37db-aa0e-f6114e5589e6", "product": {"name": "vim"}, "product_version": "< 9.1.1043"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "188c83a6-fcb0-30e1-8013-e1b185dd1a57", "vendor": {"name": "vim"}}], "isExploited": false}
