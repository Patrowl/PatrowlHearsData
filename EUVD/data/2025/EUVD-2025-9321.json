When combined with the send permission and automatic queue creation a user could successfully send a message with a routing-type not supported by the address when that message should actually be rejected on the basis that the user doesn't have permission to change the routing-type of the address.\n\nThis issue affects Apache ActiveMQ Artemis from 2.0.0 through 2.39.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.40.0 which fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-04-01T07:26:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-01T14:12:13", "baseScore": 2.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27427", "https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/2216a75a57f098295abb283d556c8b8bda91324d", "https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis/commit/6ab458015689303db8878941abe1bc973299fc2e", "https://github.com/apache/activemq-artemis", "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-5346", "https://lists.apache.org/thread/8dzlm2vkqphyrnkrby8r8kzndsm5o6x8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27427", "GHSA-3w85-5p9g-h334"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "188ebcf5-1db2-38ca-9eee-c9191c86e981", "product": {"name": "Apache ActiveMQ Artemis"}, "product_version": "2.0.0 \u22642.39.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6beb6879-7425-3c46-b72a-7c0b8dc226d1", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
