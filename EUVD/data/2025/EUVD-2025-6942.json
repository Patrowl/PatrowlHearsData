Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager.", "datePublished": "2025-03-20T10:08:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-20T19:02:21", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7771", "https://github.com/mintplex-labs/anything-llm/commit/dd017c6cbbf42abdef7861a66558c53b66424d07", "https://huntr.com/bounties/a31a9834-e9c4-4b50-a1ec-ecb69f2a6142"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-7771", "GHSA-q8pp-mmm3-9j9w"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6fafc2d5-7441-3f30-9e3f-cedc809fa3b1", "product": {"name": "mintplex-labs/anything-llm"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1183cbeb-2d49-3391-8135-001dd2c72824", "vendor": {"name": "mintplex-labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
