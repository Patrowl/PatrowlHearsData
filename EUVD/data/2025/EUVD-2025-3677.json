{"id": "EUVD-2025-3677", "enisaUuid": "8e0c4cae-177b-3689-8798-66841609c117", "description": "fastd is a VPN daemon which tunnels IP packets and Ethernet frames over UDP. When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/port combination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved to a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This \"fast reconnect\" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13. By sending data packets with a spoofed source address to fastd instances reachable on the internet, this amplification of UDP traffic might be used to facilitate a Distributed Denial of Service attack. This vulnerability is fixed in v23.", "datePublished": "2025-01-27T17:31:38", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-28T15:39:06", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/security/advisories/GHSA-pggg-vpfv-4rcv", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/1f233bee76b722c0b3f9024f2c39c72e9f7e5843", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/3940150e801d0c91460491bec32cbcc5bbc89d5f", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/5f63fcfc18ae9cad023fa463b152d5e14192b5a8", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/9df7e516378441d2d17b89f9db5c27c8312d8f12", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/c1a07b3f2b9066c3713c68547da700b85d60f4f7", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/ce1b79b12dbfa796743b5f3a50789ade965b7023", "https://github.com/neocturne/fastd/commit/d03a0a17347efb5293e42fde7d982781e90f14ef"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24356"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c1c518d3-e477-39fc-8dec-1500beb325d8", "product": {"name": "fastd"}, "product_version": "< 23"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d0ef11d8-f2f7-349a-97f8-6b213794c32d", "vendor": {"name": "neocturne"}}], "isExploited": false}
