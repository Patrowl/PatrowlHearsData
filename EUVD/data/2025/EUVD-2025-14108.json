By the time we\nare handling the event, a new TD may be queued at this ring position.\n\nI can trigger this race by rising interrupt moderation to increase IRQ\nhandling delay. Similar delay may occur naturally due to system load.\n\nIf this ever happens after a Missed Service Error, missed TDs will be\nskipped and the new TD processed as if it matched the event. It could\nbe given back prematurely, risking data loss or buffer UAF by the xHC.\n\nDon't complete TDs on xrun events and don't warn if queued TDs don't\nmatch the event's TRB pointer, which can be NULL or a link/no-op TRB.\nDon't warn if there are no queued TDs at all.\n\nNow that it's safe, also handle xrun events if the skip flag is clear.\nThis ensures completion of any TD stuck in 'error mid TD' state right\nbefore the xrun event, which could happen if a driver submits a finite\nnumber of URBs to a buggy HC and then an error occurs on the last TD.", "datePublished": "2025-05-09T09:33:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-12T21:31:03", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16a7a8e6c47fea5c847beb696c8c21a7a44c1915", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/39a080a2925c81b0f1da0add44722ef2b78e5454", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/906dec15b9b321b546fd31a3c99ffc13724c7af4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37882"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-37882"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "077e4af7-3228-3a29-9717-03194f1b01b7", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.26"}, {"id": "4d4f0900-af7c-3f14-b088-aa14effe32c9", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <16a7a8e6c47fea5c847beb696c8c21a7a44c1915"}, {"id": "6227a832-9276-37bc-8b40-d80d50d2b76f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.15-rc1"}, {"id": "7582d89c-a501-36f6-8999-0cf07d4b7237", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.14.5"}, {"id": "9dde671d-3c78-39bd-835e-bf88da8964ca", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <906dec15b9b321b546fd31a3c99ffc13724c7af4"}, {"id": "f8c12b0c-4b35-3bc4-9e52-cff4c2d6782e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <39a080a2925c81b0f1da0add44722ef2b78e5454"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e490115-681a-370f-92a4-b857d3ef69d7", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
