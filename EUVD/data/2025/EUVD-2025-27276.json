This endpoint uses the sites query parameter, which accepts a comma-separated list of site identifiers or keys.\n\nThe vulnerability was triggered via the sites parameter, which was directly concatenated into a SQL query without proper sanitization. \n\nExploitation allowed an authenticated attacker with low privileges to extract data from database, perform privilege escalation, or trigger denial-of-service conditions. \n\nThe vulnerability was verified using tools such as SQLMap and confirmed to allow full database exfiltration and potential denial-of-service conditions via crafted payloads.\n\nThe vulnerability is fixed in the following versions of dotCMS stack:\u00a025.08.14 / 25.07.10-1v2 LTS / 24.12.27v10 LTS / 24.04.24v21 LTS", "datePublished": "2025-09-04T15:30:28", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-11T15:31:17", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://dev.dotcms.com/docs/known-security-issues?issueNumber=SI-73", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8311"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-8311"], "assigner": "dotCMS", "epss": 1.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "28bb4483-830b-3fe5-9c44-28f2dcc0eabd", "product": {"name": "dotCMS Cloud Services (dCS)"}, "product_version": "24.03.22+"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd9c0b45-3a7a-3d03-8ca8-69e1b2ca2e8a", "vendor": {"name": "dotCMS"}}], "isExploited": false}
