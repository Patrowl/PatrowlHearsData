Then, it could manipulate the victim's congestion control state by sending ACK frames exercising an opportunistic ACK attack; see RFC 9000 Section 21.4. The victim could grow the congestion window beyond typical expectations and allow more bytes in flight than the path might really support.\n\n\n\nPatches\n\n\nquiche 0.24.4 is the earliest version containing the fix for this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-06-18T15:45:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-18T15:45:49", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/security/advisories/GHSA-2v9p-3p3h-w56j"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-4820"], "assigner": "cloudflare", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c62c964e-0a8d-3c9b-913a-430c2ce326e2", "product": {"name": "quiche"}, "product_version": "<0.24.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3330f562-22de-3d88-91c0-0f9c384e37f7", "vendor": {"name": "Cloudflare"}}], "isExploited": false}
