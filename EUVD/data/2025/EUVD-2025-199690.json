Prior to version 1.7.1, an extension execution path in Faction\u2019s extension framework permits untrusted extension code to execute arbitrary system commands on the server when a lifecycle hook is invoked, resulting in remote code execution (RCE) on the host running Faction. Due to a missing authentication check on the /portal/AppStoreDashboard endpoint, an attacker can access the extension management UI and upload a malicious extension without any authentication, making this vulnerability exploitable by unauthenticated users.
