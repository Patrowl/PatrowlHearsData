The imager's 'public-key authentication' setting unintentionally re-adds a user's id_rsa.pub key from their local Windows machine to the authorized_keys file on the Raspberry Pi, even after the user explicitly deletes the key from the user interface. This creates an unintended attack surface, as it could allow an attacker to use a different key than the intended one to login to the device.", "datePublished": "2025-11-03T15:30:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T21:34:42", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-imager/issues/1185", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-60892"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-60892"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a9c26a0-ac4c-3427-8d9b-f5aacd234f1e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "92f83855-99a2-33b8-992c-e32bdbfeb447", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
