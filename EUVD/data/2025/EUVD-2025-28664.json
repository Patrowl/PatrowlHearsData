Prior to version 3.4.11, a remote code execution vulnerability was identified, caused by improper validation of uploaded files. The application allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary filenames, including those with a .php extension. Because the uploaded file is written directly to disk without adequate sanitization or extension restrictions, a spreadsheet file followed by PHP code can be uploaded and executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to insufficient mitigation of CVE-2025-22133. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.11.", "datePublished": "2025-08-29T22:15:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-02T19:24:25", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-wj2c-237g-cgqp"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58159"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d908b900-83f8-30b5-9312-dd270ff2965d", "product": {"name": "WeGIA"}, "product_version": "< 3.4.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "917d3d95-4057-32f2-8219-8c06df40c7bb", "vendor": {"name": "LabRedesCefetRJ"}}], "isExploited": false}
