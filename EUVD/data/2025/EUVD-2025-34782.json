Since valid indices are $0$ to $\\text{len}-1$, starting the read at index $\\text{len}$ is one element past the end of the array.\n\n\nThis allows an attacker to cause an Out-of-Bounds Read of one element immediately following the buffer. While the scope of this read is small (one element), it can potentially lead to Information Disclosure of adjacent memory contents, depending on the execution environment.", "datePublished": "2025-10-16T18:30:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-30T18:31:07", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:L/VA:L/SC:H/SI:L/SA:L", "references": ["https://bellard.org/quickjs/Changelog", "https://issuetracker.google.com/434194797", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62492"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62492"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee5082dc-9efb-30b6-963d-41c34a3c8ebb", "product": {"name": "QuickJS"}, "product_version": "2025-04-26 <2025-09-13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3e78ea7b-009c-3d41-83f9-844a260e08df", "vendor": {"name": "QuickJS"}}], "isExploited": false}
