Insufficient validation checks on the log destination directory during log rotation could allow a non-administrator user to create a symlink from a client log file to a privileged location. On log rotation, this could lead to code execution with root privileges if the user made crafted API calls which injected arbitrary code into the log file. We recommend users upgrade to AWS VPN Client for macOS 5.2.1 or the latest version.", "datePublished": "2025-10-07T21:31:06", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-14T18:30:27", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11462", "https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-020", "https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download", "https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/", "https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/AWS-2025-020/", "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-user/client-vpn-connect-macos-release-notes.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11462", "GHSA-v9x5-mfpj-jr3h"], "assigner": "AMZN", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a3008c83-a5c1-324a-9bf0-d4a762f8244b", "product": {"name": "Client VPN"}, "product_version": "1.3.2 <5.2.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "475c3a68-1233-398e-85ca-239276863d77", "vendor": {"name": "aws"}}], "isExploited": false}
