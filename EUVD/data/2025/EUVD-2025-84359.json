This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting SVG files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid SVG file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T11:03:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T15:29:19", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f8615422-5db7-495d-9956-7d6f658f42bf?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3391933/blocksy-companion/trunk/framework/features/svg.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12846"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12846"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9f1b593e-feaa-3069-b4ac-41d0e06fb434", "product": {"name": "Blocksy Companion"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.1.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67fea822-2198-3dbe-862f-c480bba41843", "vendor": {"name": "creativethemeshq"}}], "isExploited": false}
