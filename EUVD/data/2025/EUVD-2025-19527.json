This does not imply a flaw in the target applications, but in how the VPN client internally handles outgoing headers and requests.", "datePublished": "2025-06-30T10:37:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-30T10:37:05", "baseScore": 2.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/host-header-injection-hhi-hotspot-shield-vpn-client"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-40710"], "assigner": "INCIBE", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c044e053-7c1b-36fb-bd62-139eb61495f7", "product": {"name": "Hotspot Shield VPN client"}, "product_version": "12.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2cc7d89-3137-30f3-8717-7f85fd222511", "vendor": {"name": "Hotspot Shield"}}], "isExploited": false}
