When the Prometheus Remote Write input plugin is running and listening on an IP address and port, one can send a packet with Content-Length: 0 and it crashes the server. Improper handling of the case when Content-Length is 0 allows a user (with access to the endpoint) to perform a remote Denial of service attack. The crash happens because of a NULL pointer dereference when 0 (from the Content-Length) is passed to the function cfl_sds_len, which in turn tries to cast a NULL pointer into struct cfl_sds. This is related to process_payload_metrics_ng() at prom_rw_prot.c.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-19T15:00:24", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50608", "https://fluentbit.io/announcements", "https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit/releases", "https://www.ebryx.com/blogs/exploring-cve-2024-50608-and-cve-2024-50609", "https://fluentbit.io/announcements/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-50608", "GHSA-x9j4-33qm-hgjp"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fc4d995f-1cf1-3dd1-b478-5a54e4207870", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a0cbff7f-529b-3070-a45d-dbff1ca66ad2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
