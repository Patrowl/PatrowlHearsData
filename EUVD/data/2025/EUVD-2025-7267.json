Files can be uploaded to OpenSlides meetings and organized in folders. The interface allows users to download a ZIP archive that contains all files in a folder and its subfolders. If an attacker specifies the title of a file or folder as a relative or absolute path (e.g., ../../../etc/passwd), the ZIP archive generated for download converts that title into a path. Depending on the extraction tool used by the user, this might overwrite files locally outside of the chosen directory.", "datePublished": "2025-03-21T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-21T14:01:52", "baseScore": 3.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30343", "https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2025-001-OpenSlides"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-30343", "GHSA-mwpv-367w-4cpc"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e1c5ddb3-1947-3cba-8e91-b3575268edce", "product": {"name": "OpenSlides"}, "product_version": "0 <4.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d7546096-860f-3763-80a7-9773cc37e3b3", "vendor": {"name": "Intevation"}}], "isExploited": false}
