When a printer is registered, the software stores the printer\u2019s host name in the variable\u202f$printer_vo->str_host_address. The code later builds a URL like 'http://<host\u2011address>:80/DevMgmt/DiscoveryTree.xml' and sends the request with curl. No validation, whitelist, or private\u2011network filtering is performed before the request is made.\u00a0Because the request is blind, an attacker cannot see the data directly, but can still: probe internal services, trigger internal actions, or gather other intelligence. This vulnerability has been confirmed to be remediated, but it is unclear as to when the patch was introduced.", "datePublished": "2025-09-29T20:41:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T23:56:37", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2025-04-08-vasion-printerlogic-83-vulnerabilities.html#va-ssrf-05", "https://help.printerlogic.com/va/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://help.printerlogic.com/saas/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/vasion-print-printerlogic-ssrf-via-hp-update-php-script", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34229"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34229"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1e040a22-dc80-3cbe-8409-855cb1e66966", "product": {"name": "Print Application"}, "product_version": "* <25.1.1413"}, {"id": "5f9a7d02-2dcb-3394-9826-fb478cfa828e", "product": {"name": "Print Virtual Appliance Host"}, "product_version": "* <25.1.102"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9a9d26c-ed6f-35ad-9865-f5faa38f2f7a", "vendor": {"name": "Vasion"}}], "isExploited": false}
