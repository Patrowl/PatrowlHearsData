The Zed IDE loads Language Server Protocol (LSP) configurations from the `settings.json` file located within a project\u2019s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious LSP configuration can contain arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running the IDE. This can be triggered when a user opens project file for which there is an LSP entry.  A concerted effort by an attacker to seed a project settings file (`./zed/settings.json`) with malicious language server configurations could result in arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges if the user opens the project in Zed without reviewing the contents. Version 0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust mechanism. As a workaround, users should carefully review the contents of project settings files (`./zed/settings.json`) before opening new projects in Zed.", "datePublished": "2025-12-17T22:45:42", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-18T15:34:07", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/security/advisories/GHSA-29cp-2hmh-hcxj", "https://zed.dev/blog/secure-by-default"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-68432"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "60988b6d-1ddf-3548-9ea6-52afa67e62da", "product": {"name": "zed"}, "product_version": "< 0.218.2-pre"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3ac9e44e-7d60-33dc-9fdd-2ddb4cfcb8d2", "vendor": {"name": "zed-industries"}}], "isExploited": false}
