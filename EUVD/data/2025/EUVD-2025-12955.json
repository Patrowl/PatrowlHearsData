In\nthis process, tag_ops->disconnect(ds) was made to be called only from\nswitch.c (cross-chip notifiers emitted as a result of dynamic tag proto\nchanges), but the normal driver teardown code path wasn't replaced with\nanything.\n\nSolve this problem by adding a function that does the opposite of\ndsa_switch_setup_tag_protocol(), which is called from the equivalent\nspot in dsa_switch_teardown(). The positioning here also ensures that we\nwon't have any use-after-free in tagging protocol (*rcv) ops, since the\nteardown sequence is as follows:\n\ndsa_tree_teardown\n-> dsa_tree_teardown_master\n   -> dsa_master_teardown\n      -> unsets master->dsa_ptr, making no further packets match the\n         ETH_P_XDSA packet type handler\n-> dsa_tree_teardown_ports\n   -> dsa_port_teardown\n      -> dsa_slave_destroy\n         -> unregisters DSA net devices, there is even a synchronize_net()\n            in unregister_netdevice_many()\n-> dsa_tree_teardown_switches\n   -> dsa_switch_teardown\n      -> dsa_switch_teardown_tag_protocol\n         -> finally frees the tagger-owned storage", "datePublished": "2025-05-01T15:31:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-07T21:31:19", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49808", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e0c19fcb8b5323716140fa82b79aa9f60e60407", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5809fb03942dbac25144db5bebea84fa003ecaca"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-49808", "GHSA-m9hv-2rww-w638"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "036bb540-94c9-3729-bcad-5bd1db178263", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.0.10"}, {"id": "27e6677c-ec94-371d-b66f-8e831dc95414", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "7f2973149c22e7a6fee4c0c9fa6b8e4108e9c208 <4e0c19fcb8b5323716140fa82b79aa9f60e60407"}, {"id": "2d6cc74d-bd40-32d3-8464-8f32d07ad899", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "83f9bd33-d1f5-3e13-9c59-bef4a5446cc1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "7f2973149c22e7a6fee4c0c9fa6b8e4108e9c208 <5809fb03942dbac25144db5bebea84fa003ecaca"}, {"id": "b235533a-85c0-3d1b-aec6-10ff15a6659f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.17"}, {"id": "ba60ef9f-ae48-3258-a4d7-877dfe9dd153", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0734a313-b487-340d-a314-c13628aa6c7a", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
