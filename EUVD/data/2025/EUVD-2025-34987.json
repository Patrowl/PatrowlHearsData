This leads to use-after-free\nscenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while\ntunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel\nin tb_dp_dprx_work().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0                            | CPU 1\ntb_dp_tunnel_active()            |\n  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()\n    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()\n      tb_dp_activate()           |\n        tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker\n          cancel_delayed_work()  |\n    tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |\n                                 |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF\n                                 |   tunnel-> //UAF\n\nReplacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is\nnot feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()\nand the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()\nwould wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.\n\nInstead, implement proper reference counting:\n- If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release\n  the reference in the stop function.\n- If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the\n  reference is released in delayed work function itself.\n\nThis ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution\nwhile preventing memory leaks.\n\nThis bug was found by static analysis.", "datePublished": "2025-10-18T08:03:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-01T06:16:15", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c07923f6a8729fc27ee652221a51702ff6654097", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67600ccfc4f38ebd331b9332ac94717bfbc87ea7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40002"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-40002"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2351447e-60f1-3efa-ad85-253c13ea98cf", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "d6d458d42e1e1544a18f37f1d5c840e00d5261b9 <67600ccfc4f38ebd331b9332ac94717bfbc87ea7"}, {"id": "3a723f5c-0e08-35c4-abe6-8a3ef4342f8b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18"}, {"id": "3ca65dcc-8cb0-3b71-aad4-f220372dce51", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.14"}, {"id": "4e086c17-d1c4-3a3e-b82a-583edb6e8553", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18-rc1"}, {"id": "59ff1860-8d2a-300c-8c89-d0f4b06338fd", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "8dd29f04-0766-32b6-84dc-daf08e6f4852", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17.3"}, {"id": "a392c0d3-53ef-3517-9e52-2b3b0cb0666b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "d6d458d42e1e1544a18f37f1d5c840e00d5261b9 <c07923f6a8729fc27ee652221a51702ff6654097"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a1cec6f-4436-37d6-b8a4-2a2fa54a2d11", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
