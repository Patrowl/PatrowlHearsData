When pages in a PDF are deleted via JavaScript, the application may fail to properly update internal states. Subsequent annotation management operations assume these states are valid, causing dereference of invalid or released memory. This can lead to memory corruption, application crashes, and potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.", "datePublished": "2025-12-11T18:30:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-11T18:30:44", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55314"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-55314"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89b21846-4635-3990-9969-9c0102cb075e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "613d3cc0-dbf2-374c-b9de-73b8f52a8b4a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
