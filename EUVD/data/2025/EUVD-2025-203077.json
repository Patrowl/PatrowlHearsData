This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'ays_sccp_results_export_file' AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to export sensitive plugin data including email addresses, IP addresses, physical addresses, user IDs, and other user information via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The exported data is stored in a publicly accessible file, allowing attackers to receive the sensitive information even though they are not authenticated.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T11:15:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T14:41:32", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14159", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/secure-copy-content-protection/tags/4.8.7/admin/class-secure-copy-content-protection-admin.php#L645", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/secure-copy-content-protection/tags/4.9.3/admin/class-secure-copy-content-protection-admin.php#L696", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/secure-copy-content-protection/#developers", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7cffe04e-a2e5-4752-a5c1-7c95f0007e0b?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14159", "GHSA-4x4p-8hj2-h92h"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f7cf3f8e-8f27-3183-9d08-81f1f8532199", "product": {"name": "Secure Copy Content Protection and Content Locking"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eb0168c3-c4e7-347e-92a1-6573e52d5131", "vendor": {"name": "ays-pro"}}], "isExploited": false}
