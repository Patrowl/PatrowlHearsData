This grants access to internal services (HTTP APIs, Redis, MySQL, etc.) that are intended to be isolated inside the container network. Many of those services are accessible without authentication or are vulnerable to known exploitation chains. As a result, compromise of a single reachable endpoint or basic network access can enable lateral movement, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and full system compromise.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2025-003 \u2014 Insecure Access to Docker Instance from WAN.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T18:50:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T23:56:33", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34202", "https://help.printerlogic.com/saas/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://help.printerlogic.com/va/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2025-04-08-vasion-printerlogic-83-vulnerabilities.html#va-insecure-access-docker-instances-from-wan", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/vasion-print-printerlogic-insecure-access-to-docker-instances-wan"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34202", "GHSA-47v2-7qf3-926r"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.73, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "168f6e2f-4166-398d-abde-c4f84a49736f", "product": {"name": "Print Virtual Appliance Host"}, "product_version": "* <25.2.169"}, {"id": "39e0c8e9-fb14-3a7e-9e16-1f51301b7ee2", "product": {"name": "Print Application"}, "product_version": "* <20.0.278625.2.1518"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c14acc55-be39-3180-8db5-34b2930f23d2", "vendor": {"name": "Vasion"}}], "isExploited": false}
