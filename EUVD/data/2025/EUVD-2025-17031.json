Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API\u2014even by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `\"Allow-Linux-Login\"`), add themselves to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official, centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed, and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API.", "datePublished": "2025-06-05T22:29:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-09T14:47:19", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/security/advisories/GHSA-gcxr-m95v-qcf7", "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/issues/554", "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/commit/918577f6a8392a71d9d3d67f20962c372a0c01c6", "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1035045/azure-ad-b2c-creates-groups-with-the-same-name-usi?utm_source=chatgpt.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-49012"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1c0a70fc-38d7-3968-b33f-ebeda694af98", "product": {"name": "himmelblau"}, "product_version": "= 1.0.0-alpha"}, {"id": "2b7d6d46-3d5f-30fc-8c01-704807f60ad5", "product": {"name": "himmelblau"}, "product_version": "0.9.0, < 0.9.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f7acc0fd-aa64-320c-92a7-b3e8f2f9d7d8", "vendor": {"name": "himmelblau-idm"}}], "isExploited": false}
