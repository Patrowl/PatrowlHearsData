Prior to 15.86.0 and 14.99.2, certain requests were vulnerable to path traversal attacks, wherein some files from the server could be retrieved if the full path was known. Sites hosted on Frappe Cloud, and even other setups that are behind a reverse proxy like NGINX are unaffected. This would mainly affect someone directly using werkzeug/gunicorn. In those cases, either an upgrade or changing the setup to use a reverse proxy is recommended.
