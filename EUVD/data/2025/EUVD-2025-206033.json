The flaw is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in the license management logic. The regService process, which runs with SYSTEM privileges, creates a fixed directory and writes files without verifying whether the path is an NTFS reparse point. By exploiting this race condition, an attacker can replace the target directory with a junction pointing to a user-controlled path. This causes the SYSTEM-level process to drop binaries in a location fully controlled by the attacker, allowing arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited by any standard user with only a single UAC confirmation, making it highly practical and dangerous in real-world environments.", "datePublished": "2025-12-31T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-02T18:05:57", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61037", "https://gist.github.com/jc0818/233462416579661e4e2795f96457a6bf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61037", "GHSA-rw3j-4v23-wxg4"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb7de9cf-7f53-3ff4-822b-165046594253", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3ad2559-db34-33c5-a4be-45c4e1cbfa09", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
