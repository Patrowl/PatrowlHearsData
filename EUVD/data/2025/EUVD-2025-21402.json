Prior to version 0.24.3, an unauthenticated preview deployment vulnerability in Dokploy allows any user to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive environment variables by simply opening a pull request on a public repository. This exposes secrets and potentially enables remote code execution, putting all public Dokploy users using these preview deployments at risk. Version 0.24.3 contains a fix for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-07-14T22:44:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-15T19:49:44", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/security/advisories/GHSA-h67g-mpq5-6ph5", "https://github.com/Dokploy/dokploy/commit/1977235d313824b9764f1a06785fb7f73ab7eba2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53825"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12bec4d5-b5b1-3614-908b-61ff3bce8a03", "product": {"name": "dokploy"}, "product_version": "< 0.24.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e1f3b37-8baa-38e8-be8b-9f586ac01391", "vendor": {"name": "Dokploy"}}], "isExploited": false}
