A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "datePublished": "2025-03-17T22:04:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-17T22:04:34", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-29910"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "70a9fdbd-eaab-3c43-869b-f8fca41db9fa", "product": {"name": "CryptoLib"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a7dbab76-c491-3b9f-bb1b-0f02a89d3faf", "vendor": {"name": "NASA"}}], "isExploited": false}
