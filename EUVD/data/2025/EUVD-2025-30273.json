As a result, an on-path attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and substitute malicious update payloads for legitimate ones. The eScan AV client accepted these substituted packages and executed or loaded their components (including sideloaded DLLs and Java/installer payloads), enabling remote code execution on affected systems. MicroWorld eScan confirmed remediation of the update mechanism on 2023-07-31 but versioning details are unavailable. NOTE: MicroWorld eScan disputes the characterization in third-party reports, stating the issue relates to 2018\u20132019 and that controls were implemented then.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T18:54:08", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-19T15:58:41", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13990", "https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/hackers-infect-users-of-antivirus-service-that-delivered-updates-over-http", "https://blog.avast.com/leading-the-charge-against-guptiminer", "https://securityaffairs.com/162228/breaking-news/escan-antivirus-mitm-attack.html", "https://thehackernews.com/2024/04/escan-antivirus-update-mechanism.html", "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-hijack-antivirus-updates-to-drop-guptiminer-malware", "https://www.escanav.com/en/about-us/eScan-update-advisory.asp", "https://www.gendigital.com/blog/insights/research/guptiminer-hijacking-antivirus-updates-for-distributing-backdoors-and-casual-mining", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/microworld-escan-av-insecure-update-mechanism-allows-mitm-replacement-of-updates", "https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/hackers-infect-users-of-antivirus-service-that-delivered-updates-over-http/", "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-hijack-antivirus-updates-to-drop-guptiminer-malware/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13990", "GHSA-5327-q2rh-5x5w"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "84155dd9-ccca-3657-bda3-9caa0b52a80d", "product": {"name": "eScan AV"}, "product_version": "*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd52dee3-438d-32c8-851b-75a3322ad6c3", "vendor": {"name": "MicroWorld Technologies"}}], "isExploited": false}
