This grants excessive privileges by permitting unrestricted access to powerful Docker commands.\n\nThe vulnerability affects only Docker Desktop 4.46.0 users that have ECI enabled and are using the Docker socket command restrictions feature. In addition, since ECI restricts mounting the Docker socket into containers by default, it only affects containers which are explicitly allowed by the administrator to mount the Docker socket.", "datePublished": "2025-09-26T21:05:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-30T03:55:08", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10657", "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10657", "GHSA-g3fh-rgmp-4frg"], "assigner": "Docker", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d37b42e1-7246-3de5-af73-ef884d425e77", "product": {"name": "Docker Desktop"}, "product_version": "4.46.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b11d9837-c485-3b7f-9154-640f912ebb7d", "vendor": {"name": "Docker"}}], "isExploited": false}
