When they are powered on, an X11 display server is started. The display server listens on all network interfaces and is accessible over port 6000. The X11 access control list, by default, allows connections from 127.0.0.1 and 192.168.2.15. If a device is powered on and later connected to a network with DHCP, the device may not be assigned the 192.168.2.15 IP address, leaving the display server accessible by other devices on the network. The exposed X11 display server can then be used to gain root privileges and the ability to execute code remotely by interacting with matchbox-desktop and spawning a terminal. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.", "datePublished": "2025-12-04T15:30:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-05T21:30:22", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0014388_IonOneTouch2Sys_UG.pdf", "https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4474779", "https://documents.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/CORP/Product-Guides/Ion_OneTouch_2_and_Torrent_Suite_Software.pdf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54304"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54304"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2251d304-4e3e-396d-a44f-3832ad56da55", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "338309fa-6b59-3beb-ae6e-b75d428712d5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
