Prior to version 1.1.1, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.1. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.", "datePublished": "2025-04-22T17:46:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T15:59:02", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cuba-platform/jpawebapi/security/advisories/GHSA-hg25-w3vg-7279", "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32961", "https://github.com/cuba-platform/jpawebapi/commit/78b837d7e2b12d0df69cef1bc6042ebf3bdaf22c", "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html", "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-cuba-application", "https://github.com/cuba-platform/jpawebapi"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32961", "GHSA-hg25-w3vg-7279"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5e9d071f-2d55-3f76-9546-ff0714f0974a", "product": {"name": "jpawebapi"}, "product_version": "< 1.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "03618f6a-728c-3729-b115-2fd809ed9284", "vendor": {"name": "cuba-platform"}}], "isExploited": false}
