This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, when an administrator deletes the submission, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-07-22T06:38:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-22T15:08:36", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/894b43ed-143d-4c0b-afd1-05fcd6fa5018?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/extensions-for-cf7/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3330857%40extensions-for-cf7&new=3330857%40extensions-for-cf7&sfp_email=&sfph_mail="], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7645"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d8e5c040-997f-3603-a092-181dd2b85bc4", "product": {"name": "Extensions For CF7 (Contact form 7 Database, Conditional Fields and Redirection)"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dac94a29-7d24-38ab-9af6-eb5c1c8c6a55", "vendor": {"name": "htplugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
