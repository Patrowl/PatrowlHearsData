Our threat hunting and intelligence team are actively monitoring for exploitation and we maintain visibility into any such attempts. \n\n\nThe Falcon sensor for Mac, the Falcon sensor for Linux and the Falcon sensor for Legacy Systems are not impacted by this.\n\nCrowdStrike was made aware of this issue through our HackerOne bug bounty program.
