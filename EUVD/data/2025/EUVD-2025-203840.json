Versions prior to 10.16.1 have a ReDOS bug found within the figure caption extension (`pymdownx.blocks.caption`). In systems that take unchecked user content, this could cause long hanges when processing the data if a malicious payload was crafted. This issue is patched in Release 10.16.1. As a workaround, those who process unknown user content without timeouts or other safeguards in place to prevent really large, malicious content being aimed at systems may avoid the use of `pymdownx.blocks.caption` until they're able to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2025-12-16T18:06:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-17T18:51:08", "baseScore": 2.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/security/advisories/GHSA-r6h4-mm7h-8pmq", "https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions/commit/b50d15a56850ed1408a284bba81cc019c6bd72e8", "https://pypi.org/project/pymdown-extensions/10.16.1", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-68142"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-68142"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e1725384-9528-34d9-9611-56934aa660c9", "product": {"name": "pymdown-extensions"}, "product_version": "< 10.16.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "05c23a76-6fb0-3101-92a6-61317a342648", "vendor": {"name": "facelessuser"}}], "isExploited": false}
