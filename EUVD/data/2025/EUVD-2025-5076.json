Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka \"Alert\"), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself, and highly discouraged.", "datePublished": "2025-02-24T20:59:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-25T14:34:56", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-9582-88hr-54w3", "https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-p75g-cxfj-7wrx", "https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/680", "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4684", "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4685", "https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/include"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27137"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d6e959b1-0ba8-3337-816d-95e15c53e843", "product": {"name": "Dependency-Track"}, "product_version": "< 4.12.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5529aa9d-66c1-3698-bf48-f3490594e9be", "vendor": {"name": "DependencyTrack"}}], "isExploited": false}
