{"id": "EUVD-2025-198197", "enisaUuid": "58980aa3-a772-3d54-ab37-f0f2c555f9a8", "description": "eGovFramework/egovframe-common-components versions up to and including 4.3.1 contain an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability via the /utl/wed/insertImage.do and /utl/wed/insertImageCk.do image upload endpoints. These controllers accept multipart requests without authentication, pass the uploaded content to a shared upload helper, and store the file on the server under a framework-controlled path. The framework then returns a download URL that can be used to retrieve the uploaded content, including an attacker-controlled Content-Type within the limits of the image upload functionality. While a filename extension whitelist is enforced, the attacker fully controls the file contents. The response MIME type used is also attacker-controlled when the file is served up to version < 4.1.2. Since version 4.1.2, it is possible to download any image uploaded with any whitelisted content type. But any file uploaded other than an image will be served with the `application/octet-stream` content type (the content type is no longer controlled by the attacker since version 4.1.2). This enables an unauthenticated attacker to use any affected application as a persistent file hosting service for arbitrary content under the application's origin. KISA/KrCERT has identified this unpatched vulnerability as \"KVE-2023-5280.\"", "datePublished": "2025-11-19T16:20:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-19T16:48:16", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34336", "https://github.com/eGovFramework/egovframe-common-components", "https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2025-egovframe.txt", "https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2025-11-20-egovframe-2-vulnerabilities.html", "https://www.egovframe.go.kr/eng/sub.do?menuNo=2", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/egovframework-unauthenticated-file-upload-via-web-editor-image-upload-endpoints"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34336", "GHSA-7x97-5m4c-4jvm"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1f4c316e-425e-39f5-9a76-ab89af93d35b", "product": {"name": "eGovFramework/egovframe-common-components"}, "product_version": "0 \u22644.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4903731e-1d30-3a75-b088-e1b4e63d4b27", "vendor": {"name": "eGovFramework/egovframe-common-components"}}], "isExploited": false}
