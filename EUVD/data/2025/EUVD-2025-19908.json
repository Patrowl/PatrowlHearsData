Prior to version 3.5.29, the MMRDecoder::scanruns method is affected by an OOB-write vulnerability, because it does not check that the xr pointer stays within the bounds of the allocated buffer. This can lead to writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a heap corruption condition. An out-of-bounds read with pr is also possible for the same reason. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.29.", "datePublished": "2025-07-03T21:07:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:11:47", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2025-055_DjVuLibre/", "https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/cve-2025-53367-an-exploitable-out-of-bounds-write-in-djvulibre", "https://sourceforge.net/p/djvu/djvulibre-git/ci/33f645196593d70bd5e37f55b63886c31c82c3da", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/03/1", "https://github.com/github/securitylab/tree/main/SecurityExploits/DjVuLibre/MMRDecoder_scanruns_CVE-2025-53367"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53367"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a87fb402-6737-395a-9fae-d24d9f1ec5e9", "product": {"name": "DjVuLibre"}, "product_version": "< 3.5.29"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a1cb577-5351-3438-a028-bcfae7da90ef", "vendor": {"name": "DjvuNet"}}], "isExploited": false}
