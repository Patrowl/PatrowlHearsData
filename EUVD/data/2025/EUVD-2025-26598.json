In versions 0.72.0 through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0.", "datePublished": "2025-09-03T03:20:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-03T15:44:28", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/outline/outline/security/advisories/GHSA-gcj7-c9jv-fhgf", "https://github.com/outline/outline/commit/18bc93c9c207329244c6909606a2393e863892a3", "https://github.com/outline/outline/releases/tag/v0.84.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58351"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9b15a801-3ec6-3538-a805-d31bf9b6ad38", "product": {"name": "outline"}, "product_version": "0.72.0, < 0.84.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "140c9645-82b8-3aa9-ada9-f7e4c0cdeefb", "vendor": {"name": "outline"}}], "isExploited": false}
