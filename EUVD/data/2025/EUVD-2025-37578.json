This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Additionally, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on cai_name_color parameter, this issue allows to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages, that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.", "datePublished": "2025-11-04T04:27:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T04:27:17", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12456", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/centangle-team/trunk/Centangle-Team-Showcase.php#L132", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/centangle-team/trunk/inc_/cai_setting.php#L172", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/centangle-team/trunk/inc_/cai_setting.php#L196", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/centangle-team/trunk/inc_/cai_setting.php#L88", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ff637c7-677f-4d70-b3cb-770d0a47e691?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12456", "GHSA-6h2j-h2vw-282c"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d7c7890-de03-312d-b70a-1f1a3d7a7ebd", "product": {"name": "Centangle-Team"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f787389-4566-3bb3-a9e9-261bc765711b", "vendor": {"name": "centangle"}}], "isExploited": false}
