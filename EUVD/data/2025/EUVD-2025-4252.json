This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with  access to upload files and manage filenames through a third-party plugin like a File Manager, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. The risk of this vulnerability is very minimal as it requires a user to be able to manipulate filenames in order to successfully exploit.", "datePublished": "2025-02-21T09:21:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-21T15:13:51", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12276", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3242743/ultimate-member/tags/2.10.0/includes/core/class-uploader.php", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/846f9828-2f1f-4d08-abfb-909b8d634d8a?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12276", "GHSA-mrg6-gr4g-r85w"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f0304d19-5ac0-320e-9b91-7bb1f3ae46a4", "product": {"name": "Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d1659d2f-74c4-35f6-bd96-54db240bbb04", "vendor": {"name": "ultimatemember"}}], "isExploited": false}
