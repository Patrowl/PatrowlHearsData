Specifically, an attacker could exploit a flaw that causes the BLE target (i.e., the device under attack) to attempt to disconnect a fixed channel, which is not allowed per the Bluetooth specification. This leads to undefined behavior, including potential assertion failures, crashes, or memory corruption, depending on the BLE stack implementation.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T05:21:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-19T11:57:01", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/security/advisories/GHSA-hcc8-3qr7-c9m8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10456"], "assigner": "zephyr", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a32472a5-b44b-30d8-86b5-c7d66214bd0c", "product": {"name": "Zephyr"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c154bae9-59b7-3848-82e2-ea073db4d07c", "vendor": {"name": "zephyrproject-rtos"}}], "isExploited": false}
