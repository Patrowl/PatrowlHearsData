NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2024-29415. NOTE: in current versions of several applications, connection attempts to the IP address 0 (interpreted as 0.0.0.0) are blocked with error messages such as net::ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID. However, in some situations that depend on both application version and operating system, connection attempts to 0 and 0.0.0.0 are considered connection attempts to 127.0.0.1 (and, for this reason, a false value of isPublic would be preferable).", "datePublished": "2025-09-16T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-16T19:14:07", "baseScore": 3.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://cosmosofcyberspace.github.io/CVE-Application-Document.html", "https://github.com/indutny/node-ip/tags", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59437"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59437"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "65147867-30a7-33ea-a697-8cdc95fb9cab", "product": {"name": "ip"}, "product_version": "0 \u22642.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4676d555-7d1c-381e-9fff-fdb5c2cd039d", "vendor": {"name": "fedorindutny"}}], "isExploited": false}
