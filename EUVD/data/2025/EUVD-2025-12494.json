This makes it possible for attackers to inject a PHP Object through a PHAR file. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software, which means this vulnerability has no impact unless another plugin or theme containing a POP chain is installed on the site. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it may allow the attacker to perform actions like delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code depending on the POP chain present. This vulnerability may be exploited by unauthenticated attackers when a form is present on the site with the file download action, and the ability to upload files is also present. Otherwise, this would be considered exploitable by Contributor-level users and above, because they could create the form needed to successfully exploit this.", "datePublished": "2025-04-26T05:34:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-26T05:34:22", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2105", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3279676/jupiterx-core/trunk/includes/extensions/raven/includes/utils.php", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/jupiterx-core", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/3427387e-30d2-40a5-9bfd-d458039d8e2e?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/jupiterx-core/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-2105", "GHSA-4gp3-vjp8-9r2q"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dd22bdf6-b581-3f78-8c23-c639c50e1d0a", "product": {"name": "Jupiter X Core"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.8.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "55ce004d-32cf-34ec-9040-f371e9913ca9", "vendor": {"name": "artbees"}}], "isExploited": false}
