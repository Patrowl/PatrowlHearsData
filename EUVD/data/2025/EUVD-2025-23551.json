This allows a malicious actor to craft a fake installer with a forged SHA-1 certificate that may still be accepted by Windows signature verification mechanisms, particularly on systems without strict SmartScreen or trust policy enforcement. Additionally, the installer lacks High Entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), as confirmed by BinSkim (BA2015 rule) and repeated WinDbg analysis. The binary consistently loads into predictable memory ranges, increasing the success rate of memory corruption exploits. These two misconfigurations, when combined, significantly lower the bar for successful supply-chain style attacks or privilege escalation through fake installers.", "datePublished": "2025-08-04T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-05T13:42:40", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/meisterlos/CVE", "https://github.com/meisterlos/CVE-2025-51726"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-51726"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7bd381db-109a-3f47-a1bc-690ef2afb687", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "271de659-9167-38ec-b9f5-0c49ecb81d63", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
