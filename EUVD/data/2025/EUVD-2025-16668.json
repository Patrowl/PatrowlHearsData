Prior to version 1.8.39, the upgrade component does not validate user input properly, which allows attackers to perform local file inclusion (LFI) via a specially crafted parameter value. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the installer must be unlocked (no `install/lock` file present) and the upgrade script must be accessible (by re-installing the forum via access to `install/index.php`; when the forum has not yet been installed; or the attacker is authenticated as a forum administrator). MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-06-02T15:52:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-02T16:06:00", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-q4jv-xwjx-37cp", "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6e6cfbd524d9101b51e1278ecf520479b64b0f00", "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.39"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48940"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "affc59c4-c24a-34b2-8db9-b856b39d9506", "product": {"name": "MyBB"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.39"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af79b442-4f09-3339-a40d-8dc2f2cfff8b", "vendor": {"name": "MyBB"}}], "isExploited": false}
