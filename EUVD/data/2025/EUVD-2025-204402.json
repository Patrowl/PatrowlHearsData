In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users.", "datePublished": "2025-12-18T20:25:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-19T22:04:36", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/avahi/avahi/security/advisories/GHSA-73wf-3xmj-x82q", "https://github.com/avahi/avahi/pull/808", "https://zeropath.com/blog/avahi-simple-protocol-server-dos-cve-2025-59529"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59529"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7fd9692b-d795-3f40-98e7-72547780e772", "product": {"name": "avahi"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.9-rc2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b97991c-e294-3843-85b0-ef6021d6d7c8", "vendor": {"name": "avahi"}}], "isExploited": false}
