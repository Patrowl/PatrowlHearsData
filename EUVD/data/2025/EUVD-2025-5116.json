This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). The add_car() function may also make it possible to read arbitrary files.", "datePublished": "2025-02-27T08:22:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-27T14:35:51", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1282", "https://themeforest.net/item/car-dealer-automotive-wordpress-theme-responsive/8574708?s_rank=7", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/edf4b588-8b67-425a-b0e1-d4382cb88dd1?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-1282", "GHSA-rch8-9g8m-vjvx"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e0a42a97-bced-3534-91d6-faa7d76949c2", "product": {"name": "Car Dealer Automotive WordPress Theme \u2013 Responsive"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a9b76ca-2c88-32c3-8af7-1bfe87a358a9", "vendor": {"name": "ThemeMakers"}}], "isExploited": false}
