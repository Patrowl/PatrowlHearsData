The endpoint is accessible without authentication by default, and server-side validation of uploaded files is insufficient. This can be abused to upload arbitrary content (including non-image files) which could impersonate user/admin login panels (exfiltrating credentials) and to perform a denial-of-service attack by exhausting disk space.", "datePublished": "2025-12-02T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-06T03:51:57", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/evershopcommerce/evershop/issues/819", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65844"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65844"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e666cc72-1975-3a66-beab-303b1f0478f3", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ae2ca47-7a91-3228-9c84-7aa244032389", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
