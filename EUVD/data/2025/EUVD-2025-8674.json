This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This may be exploitable by unauthenticated attackers when the \"Allow guest users without accounts to create topics and replies\" setting is enabled.", "datePublished": "2025-03-29T07:03:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-29T07:03:31", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/df09af41-399a-4878-8420-721f1198d895?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/image-upload-for-bbpress/tags/1.1.19/bbp-image-upload.php#L136"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-2006"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2e816286-80c3-3377-a39b-2dd911aabf85", "product": {"name": "Inline Image Upload for BBPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "05c85a64-ffb0-37a6-88a9-19aff9192fee", "vendor": {"name": "aspengrovestudios"}}], "isExploited": false}
