Prior to version 1.4.0, a business logic flaw in FileRise\u2019s file/folder handling allows low-privilege users to perform unauthorized operations (view/delete/modify) on files created by other users. The root cause was inferring ownership/visibility from folder names (e.g., a folder named after a username) and missing server-side authorization/ownership checks across file operation endpoints. This amounted to an IDOR pattern: an attacker could operate on resources identified only by predictable names. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0 and further hardened in version 1.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves restricting non-admin users to read-only or disable delete/rename APIs server-side, avoid creating top-level folders named after other usernames, and adding server-side checks that verify ownership before delete/rename/move.", "datePublished": "2025-10-20T17:38:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-20T18:05:53", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-6p87-q9rh-95wh", "https://github.com/error311/FileRise/issues/53", "https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/25ce6a76beb60950359c0304765ad91a8aff8ad8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62509"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c9085de-a184-38a6-ac29-7f986e2a2602", "product": {"name": "FileRise"}, "product_version": "< 1.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83049f48-9099-3e07-95ca-485f65dca650", "vendor": {"name": "error311"}}], "isExploited": false}
