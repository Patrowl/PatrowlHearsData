There is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the email viewer in versions 7.14.0 through 7.14.6. An external attacker could send a prepared message to the inbox of the SuiteCRM-instance. By simply viewing emails as the logged-in user, the payload can be triggered. With that, an attacker is able to run arbitrary actions as the logged-in user - like extracting data, or if it is an admin executing the payload, takeover the instance. This is fixed in versions 7.14.7.", "datePublished": "2025-08-07T00:07:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-07T13:59:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-vg8q-xcq5-mh3p", "https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/releases/7.14.x/#_7_14_7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54784"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "484b67bb-8aa5-3d03-9d98-b85314f7726d", "product": {"name": "SuiteCRM"}, "product_version": "7.14.0, < 7.14.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "08e725f0-073c-33fe-af5e-75e57e81c1be", "vendor": {"name": "SuiteCRM"}}], "isExploited": false}
