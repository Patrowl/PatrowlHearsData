The MailEnable administrative executable attempts to load MEAIDP.DLL from its installation directory without sufficient integrity validation or a secure search order. A local attacker with write access to that directory can plant a malicious MEAIDP.DLL, which is then loaded on execution, resulting in attacker-controlled code running with the privileges of the process.", "datePublished": "2025-12-10T18:30:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-17T21:30:40", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://mailenable.com/Standard-ReleaseNotes.txt", "https://www.mailenable.com/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/mailenable-dll-hijacking-via-unsafe-loading-of-meaidp-dll", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34424"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34424"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3fce1f02-0ba0-3aba-b1dd-af9b04303129", "product": {"name": "MailEnable"}, "product_version": "0 <10.54"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "31d6fd3d-38d0-3e56-be3b-598b188624ac", "vendor": {"name": "MailEnable"}}], "isExploited": false}
