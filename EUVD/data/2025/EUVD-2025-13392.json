This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of WinZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, WinZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. NOTE: a third party has reported that this is a false positive, and has observed that the original CVE-2025-33028.md file has been deleted on GitHub. Also, this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file's content.", "datePublished": "2025-04-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-24T19:26:49", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-33028", "https://github.com/EnisAksu/Argonis/commit/5e1ff4e5f4fdb3f32aab465f7b429e0b91299d1d", "https://github.com/EnisAksu/Argonis/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2025-33028%20%28WinZip%29/CVE-2025-33028.md", "https://kb.winzip.com/help/help_whatsnew.htm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-33028", "GHSA-p43c-fp87-rj5p"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8217ea45-22bb-390a-81be-effd2ea6d4c8", "product": {"name": "WinZip"}, "product_version": "0 \u226429.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "34c04507-5526-3a71-8d32-ccc5b2263887", "vendor": {"name": "WinZip"}}], "isExploited": false}
