On many platforms, a third party can create a Git repository under a name that includes a shell command substitution string in the syntax $(<command>). These directory names are allowed in macOS and a majority of Linux distributions. If a user starts jupyter-lab in a parent directory of this inappropriately-named Git repository, opens it, and clicks \"Git > Open Git Repository in Terminal\" from the menu bar, then the injected command <command> is run in the user's shell without the user's permission. This issue is occurring because when that menu entry is clicked, jupyterlab-git opens the terminal and runs cd <git-repo-path> through the shell to set the current directory. Doing so runs any command substitution strings present in the directory name, which leads to the command injection issue described here. A previous patch provided an incomplete fix. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.51.1.", "datePublished": "2025-04-03T22:00:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-04T18:54:20", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/security/advisories/GHSA-cj5w-8mjf-r5f8", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30370", "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/pull/1196", "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/commit/b46482993f76d3a546015c6a94ebed8b77fc2376", "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git", "https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/blob/7eb3b06f0092223bd5494688ec264527bbeb2195/src/commandsAndMenu.tsx#L175-L184"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-30370", "GHSA-cj5w-8mjf-r5f8"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a309d0a3-4eba-30bd-a648-e7c4d26dfab9", "product": {"name": "jupyterlab-git"}, "product_version": "< 0.51.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bbc16673-8855-37c2-82c3-3ec1734c1cd9", "vendor": {"name": "jupyterlab"}}], "isExploited": false}
