The manifest contains package URLs and SHA-256 hashes but is not digitally signed, so its authenticity relies solely on the underlying TLS channel. In affected versions, TLS certificate validation can be disabled when a proxy is configured, allowing an attacker who can intercept network traffic to supply a malicious update manifest and corresponding package with a matching hash. This can cause the client to download and install a tampered update, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the GoSign Desktop user on Windows and macOS, or with elevated privileges on some Linux deployments. A local attacker who can modify proxy settings may also abuse this behavior to escalate privileges by forcing installation of a crafted update.", "datePublished": "2025-11-18T16:33:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-18T18:24:11", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.ush.it/2025/11/14/multiple-vulnerabilities-gosign-desktop-remote-code-execution/", "https://infocert.digital/consumer/gosign-suite/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/gosign-desktop-insecure-update-mechanism-rce", "https://www.ush.it/2025/11/14/vulnerabilita-multiple-gosign-desktop-esecuzione-remota-codice-arbitrario/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34324"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34324"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2744d41b-62d2-3422-878f-1b98c7858976", "product": {"name": "GoSign Desktop"}, "product_version": "0 <2.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "46102c20-2bbe-3087-a768-6e86133fdb7c", "vendor": {"name": "Tinexta InfoCert S.p.A."}}], "isExploited": false}
