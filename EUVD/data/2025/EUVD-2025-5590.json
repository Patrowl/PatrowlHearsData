However, it fails to properly verify the allocation against possible integer overflows. It's possible to cause the allocation length to overflow with a crafted tar file, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write. This flaw eventually allows an attacker to circumvent secure boot protections.", "datePublished": "2025-03-03T14:18:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T01:33:27", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45780", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45780", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345856", "https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-02/msg00024.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45780", "GHSA-xxc4-h4cm-j5r2"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de993ca8-d50b-3e83-b3d4-08bd0ccb0826", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
