In versions 0.65.1 and below and 1.0a0 through 1.0a19, deployed instances of Datasette include an open redirect vulnerability. Hits to the path //example.com/foo/bar/ (the trailing slash is required) will redirect the user to https://example.com/foo/bar. This problem has been patched in both Datasette 0.65.2 and 1.0a21. To workaround this issue, if Datasette is running behind a proxy, that proxy could be configured to replace // with / in incoming request URLs.", "datePublished": "2025-11-07T20:35:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-13T14:23:19", "baseScore": 0.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/simonw/datasette/security/advisories/GHSA-w832-gg5g-x44m", "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2429", "https://github.com/simonw/datasette/commit/f257ca6edb64848c3b04b54d41e347c54fe57c05", "https://github.com/simonw/datasette", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64481"], "aliases": ["GHSA-w832-gg5g-x44m", "CVE-2025-64481"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0eba3c6d-1515-3eca-a146-10905e21a3d3", "product": {"name": "datasette"}, "product_version": "< 0.65.2"}, {"id": "343003b9-e243-3d9f-b16f-26733880df5b", "product": {"name": "datasette"}, "product_version": "1.0a0, < 1.0a20"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8900a793-1aaf-3493-8762-e14279e7ad8e", "vendor": {"name": "simonw"}}], "isExploited": false}
