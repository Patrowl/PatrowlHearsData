The plugin\u2019s deletion handler reads the client-supplied $_POST['delete'] array and passes each ID directly to wp_delete_user() without verifying that the caller has the delete_users capability or limiting which user IDs may be removed. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Employee-level access and above, to delete arbitrary accounts, including administrators.", "datePublished": "2025-07-04T01:44:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-08T14:27:12", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/28cf0f3f-0048-4da9-aa86-243479f7b974?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/hrm/#developers", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hrm/tags/2.2.17/class/employee.php#L48"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5956"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f892573f-131e-3452-9477-fb5d12b3b8c4", "product": {"name": "WP Human Resource Management"}, "product_version": "2.0.0 \u22642.2.17"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "03ef3e26-f45e-3a85-94ce-1cc691862971", "vendor": {"name": "asaquzzaman"}}], "isExploited": false}
