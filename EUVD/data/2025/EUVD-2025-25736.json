This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-08-23T04:25:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-25T17:31:11", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/466568c5-33a9-4891-b4ad-9bc6052603cb?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wptobe-memberships/trunk/bwlms-fields/bwlms-fields.php#L156", "https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/wptobe-memberships/trunk/bwlms-fields/bwlms-fields.php"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-9048"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "edec95d4-fd20-34fa-91b3-5b1908fc5e4c", "product": {"name": "Wptobe-memberships"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "04f721d7-50f6-39f6-86b5-2b928209f7a6", "vendor": {"name": "wptobe"}}], "isExploited": false}
