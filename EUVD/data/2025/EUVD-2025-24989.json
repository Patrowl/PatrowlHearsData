This vulnerability affects the function mask_cidr6 of the file cidr.c of the component tcpprep. The manipulation leads to heap-based buffer overflow. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The researcher is able to reproduce this with the latest official release 4.5.1 and the current master branch. The code maintainer cannot reproduce this for 4.5.2-beta1. In his reply the maintainer explains that \"[i]n that case, this is a duplicate that was fixed in 4.5.2.\"", "datePublished": "2025-08-15T07:02:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-15T12:01:29", "baseScore": 2.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://vuldb.com/?id.320080", "https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.320080", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.623635", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.623636", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.623637", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.623638", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.623639", "https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues/958", "https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues/958#issuecomment-3124876035", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/13SQYVIb_YQoRfaJaaLf6iLtMiCRCHlBc/view?usp=sharing", "https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues/959"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-9019"], "assigner": "VulDB", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "652bb769-a960-3786-9f7f-b03fbb6be1df", "product": {"name": "tcpreplay"}, "product_version": "4.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c637a7a7-d1f2-3b70-93d6-9781437ba296", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
