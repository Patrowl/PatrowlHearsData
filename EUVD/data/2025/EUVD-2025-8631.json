Prior to version 10.0.1 of Publify, corresponding to versions prior to 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem, publisher on a `publify` application is able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an administrator using the redirect functionality. The exploitation of this XSS vulnerability requires the administrator to click a malicious link. An attack could attempt to hide their payload by using HTML, or other encodings, as to not make it obvious to an administrator that this is a malicious link. A publisher may attempt to use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges and become an administrator. Version 10.0.1 of Publify and version 10.0.2 of the `publify_core` rubygem fix the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-03-28T14:38:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-28T15:37:35", "baseScore": 1.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/publify/publify/security/advisories/GHSA-8fm5-gg2f-f66q", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-39311", "https://github.com/publify/publify"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-39311", "GHSA-8fm5-gg2f-f66q"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3b36f065-cb54-37ed-81f1-b0d13af66155", "product": {"name": "publify"}, "product_version": "< 10.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ae23c63-989e-3b28-bd5d-cdfbe762beac", "vendor": {"name": "publify"}}], "isExploited": false}
