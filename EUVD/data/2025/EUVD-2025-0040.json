Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.\nAfter retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-01-13T21:42:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-14T00:19:12", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-51491", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196", "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go", "https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3382"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-51491", "GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "12514c36-96ab-32f6-8269-b84e560f3a62", "product": {"name": "notation-go"}, "product_version": "= 1.3.0-rc.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25d73ea8-1f33-34ab-9442-7caf0296ccf7", "vendor": {"name": "notaryproject"}}], "isExploited": false}
