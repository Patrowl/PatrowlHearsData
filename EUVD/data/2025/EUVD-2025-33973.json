Starting in version 1.2.0 and prior to version 1.12.4, the CoreDNS etcd plugin contains a TTL confusion vulnerability where lease IDs are incorrectly used as TTL values, enabling DNS cache pinning attacks. This effectively creates a DoS condition for DNS resolution of affected services. The `TTL()` function in `plugin/etcd/etcd.go` incorrectly casts etcd lease IDs (64-bit integers) to uint32 and uses them as TTL values. Large lease IDs become very large TTLs when cast to uint32. This enables cache pinning attacks. Version 1.12.4 contains a fix for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-09-09T19:27:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-10T14:26:13", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/coredns/coredns/security/advisories/GHSA-93mf-426m-g6x9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58063", "https://github.com/coredns/coredns/commit/e1768a5d272e9da649dfb8588595e5c6e4e640bf", "https://github.com/coredns/coredns"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58063", "GHSA-93mf-426m-g6x9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d37249d8-d0a7-33a4-8c10-eb5a19b291a5", "product": {"name": "coredns"}, "product_version": "1.2.0, < 1.12.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "38072756-7f64-33e1-a3ea-3f971a4ca9d2", "vendor": {"name": "coredns"}}], "isExploited": false}
