Prior to version 3.20.3, there was an issue where the Roo Code agent's `search_files` tool did not respect the setting to disable reads outside of the VS Code workspace. This means that an attacker who was able to inject a prompt into the agent could potentially read a sensitive file and then write the information to a JSON schema. Users have the option to disable schema fetching in VS Code, but the feature is enabled by default. For users with this feature enabled, writing to the schema would trigger a network request without the user having a chance to deny. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent. Version 3.20.3 fixed the issue where `search_files` did not respect the setting to limit it to the workspace. This reduces the scope of the damage if an attacker is able to take control of the agent through prompt injection or another vector.", "datePublished": "2025-06-27T21:43:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-27T21:43:31", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-wr2q-46pg-f228", "https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/commit/10b2fb32ed047bbd7b8d10ef185c1ed345efcc92", "https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/commit/7d0b22f9e659dc6c26aab0bacbea27874986e772"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53097"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cf470c4d-02d9-329d-9c17-b4d0c09ba195", "product": {"name": "Roo-Code"}, "product_version": "< 3.20.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e98b8343-722e-374e-8ffd-b37790eb44c1", "vendor": {"name": "RooCodeInc"}}], "isExploited": false}
