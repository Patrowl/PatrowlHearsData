Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized `.mdl` payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. Note that the payload file is a hidden file, making it difficult for the victim to detect tampering. More importantly, during the model training process, after the `.mdl` file is loaded and executes arbitrary code, the normal training process remains unaffected'meaning the user remains unaware of the arbitrary code execution.", "datePublished": "2025-08-01T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-01T17:17:49", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/blob/ab38bff0387a86fd9f068246c326ee7b0d5ed139/swift/hub/utils/caching.py#L141", "https://github.com/xhjy2020/CVE-2025-50472"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-50472"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6364b92d-4b2e-30ac-85c6-484f1b071224", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f7dd092-600b-32e4-a5bf-2ae578c1506b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
