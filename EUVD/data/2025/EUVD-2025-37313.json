This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled forwarded headers (such as CF-Connecting-IP, X-Forwarded-For, and others) without verifying that those headers originate from legitimate, trusted proxies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address and bypass IP-based security controls, including blocked IP lists and rate limiting protections, by sending arbitrary HTTP headers with their requests.", "datePublished": "2025-10-31T08:25:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-31T14:18:40", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b5137bc2-912b-4e25-966e-515e8d9fc21c?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/oopspam-anti-spam/tags/1.2.49/include/helpers.php#L268", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3386104/oopspam-anti-spam/trunk/include/helpers.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12094"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12094"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a410bce7-6479-36a7-9236-4205193ac489", "product": {"name": "OOPSpam Anti-Spam: Spam Protection for WordPress Forms & Comments (No CAPTCHA)"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.2.53"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f00d2924-4913-3c94-8a41-5abc477264e4", "vendor": {"name": "OOPSpam"}}], "isExploited": false}
