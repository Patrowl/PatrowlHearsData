An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of multiple crafted RADIUS access request messages to Cisco ISE. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when Cisco ISE restarts.", "datePublished": "2025-11-05T16:31:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-05T20:07:12", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-radsupress-dos-8YF3JThh", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-20343"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20343"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b384638-a45a-3693-96af-8707f4152a55", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "3.4.0"}, {"id": "905c7dec-2598-353f-b1a4-1e408122a9da", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "3.4 Patch 2"}, {"id": "d77d3bd9-c17f-3714-9056-45d2ae8357a2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "3.4 Patch 3"}, {"id": "de0967a7-e5c0-3924-b617-583e7469fb72", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "3.4 Patch 1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "98fe56c7-eb19-31e7-b770-c01ead61c7d5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
