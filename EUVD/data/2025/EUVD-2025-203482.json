Prior to versions 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 of the FreePBX framework, an authenticated local privilege escalation exists in the deprecated FreePBX startup script `amportal`. In the deprecated `amportal` utility, the lookup for the `freepbx_engine` file occurs in `/etc/asterisk/` directories. Typically, these are configured by FreePBX as writable by the **asterisk** user and any members of the **asterisk** group. This means that a member of the **asterisk** group can add their own `freepbx_engine` file in `/etc/asterisk/` and upon `amportal` executing, it would exec that file with root permissions (even though the file was created and placed by a non-root user). Version 16.0.45 and 17.0.24 contain a fix for the issue. Other mitigation strategies are also available. Confirm only trusted local OS system users are members of the `asterisk` group. Look for suspicious files in the `/etc/asterisk/` directory (via Admin -> Config Edit in the GUI, or via CLI). Double-check that `live_dangerously = no` is set (or unconfigured, as the default is **no**) in `/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf` file. Eliminate any unsafe custom use of Asterisk dial plan applications and functions that potentially can manipulate the file system, e.g., System(), FILE(), etc.", "datePublished": "2025-12-16T00:14:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-17T04:56:05", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/FreePBX/security-reporting/security/advisories/GHSA-p42w-v77m-hfp8", "https://www.freepbx.org/watch-what-we-do-with-security-fixes-%f0%9f%91%80"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-67722"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bd248d0e-3d76-32d3-bd34-d7b899d6ab56", "product": {"name": "security-reporting"}, "product_version": "17.0.0, < 17.0.24"}, {"id": "bd4eb42b-3e42-311c-a819-0a95f7daa433", "product": {"name": "security-reporting"}, "product_version": "< 16.0.45"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "193702ce-2fb2-3bda-b227-956ebab49c35", "vendor": {"name": "FreePBX"}}], "isExploited": false}
