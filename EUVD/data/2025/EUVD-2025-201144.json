This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to add, edit, or delete custom post types in limited situations.", "datePublished": "2025-12-04T06:48:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-05T17:22:05", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/90d203b1-9426-4eff-b566-02c8a1c6adfa?source=cve", "https://github.com/WebDevStudios/custom-post-type-ui/commit/215779a5ac0c624f0dcf875e87305b4898d5bcf9", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12826"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12826"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1e7ab4c2-1a9e-327f-a6ec-4c60c21ef58e", "product": {"name": "Custom Post Type UI"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.18.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "50c956c3-8ff1-36c6-8a3d-f024c3f51582", "vendor": {"name": "WebDevStudios"}}], "isExploited": false}
