Prior to version 0.1.1, if there was a policy posted to a public topic that was tied to a private group then the group members could be shown to non-group members. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.1. A workaround involves moving any policy topics with private groups to restricted categories.", "datePublished": "2025-05-29T19:25:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-30T12:35:34", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/security/advisories/GHSA-jc5r-rm2j-mh4x", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/commit/6b4390fe486408cc86ccea6b091406cfac6c5b8f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-47288"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f8470904-6e1d-3d12-9571-915de8863b19", "product": {"name": "discourse-policy"}, "product_version": "< 0.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d24477db-0385-33b4-9e24-8025367d2b88", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
