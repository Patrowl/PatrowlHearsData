This is due to the plugin not properly validating that an OTP was generated before comparing it to user input in the \"user_verification_form_wrap_process_otpLogin\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user with a verified email address, such as an administrator, by submitting an empty OTP value.", "datePublished": "2025-12-05T06:07:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-05T13:42:15", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8ccb1304-326e-43af-b75d-23874f92ba8b?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/user-verification/trunk/templates/email-otp-login-form/hook.php#L141", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12374"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12374"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aa9854fa-296f-3a78-a790-781a5cb63b7e", "product": {"name": "User Verification by PickPlugins"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.0.39"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3940dae7-5698-36a9-8544-ea4b8ce70f34", "vendor": {"name": "PickPlugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
