This may result in leaving temporary files behind on cleanup. Given automated and repeated execution of dpkg-deb commands on\nadversarial .deb packages or with well compressible files, placed\ninside a directory with permissions not allowing removal by a non-root\nuser, this can end up in a DoS scenario due to causing disk quota\nexhaustion or disk full conditions.", "datePublished": "2025-07-01T16:16:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-01T17:30:37", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://git.dpkg.org/cgit/dpkg/dpkg.git/commit/?id=ed6bbd445dd8800308c67236ba35d08004c98e82"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6297"], "assigner": "debian", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "525a295f-de49-3e1c-a19d-99909f322f25", "product": {"name": "dpkg"}, "product_version": "0 <ed6bbd445dd8800308c67236ba35d08004c98e82"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "721ff414-a7da-3780-bc18-b06e4f6098cd", "vendor": {"name": "Debian"}}], "isExploited": false}
