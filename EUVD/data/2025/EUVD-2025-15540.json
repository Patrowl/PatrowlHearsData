This flaw can be triggered when a libsoup client receives a 401 (Unauthorized) HTTP response containing a specifically crafted domain parameter within the WWW-Authenticate header. Processing this malformed header can lead to a crash of the client application using libsoup. An attacker could exploit this by setting up a malicious HTTP server. If a user's application using the vulnerable libsoup library connects to this malicious server, it could result in a denial-of-service. Successful exploitation requires tricking a user's client application into connecting to the attacker's malicious server.", "datePublished": "2025-05-16T17:56:58", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T07:25:08", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4476", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4476", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2366513"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-4476", "GHSA-qgq4-89p9-qfrh"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "95d2eca5-d9f5-3548-b690-5ccde3d5c3ca", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
