This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The vulnerability is difficult to exploit due to timing requirements and environmental factors.", "datePublished": "2025-07-18T06:45:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-18T13:03:14", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1ab970f5-35d1-43e9-891c-87a2a3e464c6?source=cve", "https://docs.stylemixthemes.com/masterstudy-lms/changelog-pro-version"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7438"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c5580e9b-dc6a-3f81-91cf-820abe3d5fa7", "product": {"name": "MasterStudy LMS Pro"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.7.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "241e30de-0739-35b2-a0cb-b1fdb5f06e60", "vendor": {"name": "StylemixThemes"}}], "isExploited": false}
