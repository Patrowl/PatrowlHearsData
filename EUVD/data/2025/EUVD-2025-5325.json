Prior to version 1.17.0, due to the missing sanitization of the path in the `POST /api/localsend/v2/prepare-upload` and the `POST /api/localsend/v2/upload` endpoint, a malicious file transfer request can write files to the arbitrary location on the system, resulting in the remote command execution. A malicious file transfer request sent by nearby devices can write files into an arbitrary directory. This usually allows command execution via the startup folder on Windows or Bash-related files on Linux. If the user enables the `Quick Save` feature, it will silently write files without explicit user interaction. Version 1.17.0 fixes this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-02-25T20:03:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-26T16:28:07", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/localsend/localsend/security/advisories/GHSA-f7jp-p6j4-3522", "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/e8635204ec782ded45bc7d698deb60f3c4105687"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27142"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.48, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bcb1c456-47e4-3ed0-a4b0-fbfdfb1a06e6", "product": {"name": "localsend"}, "product_version": "< 1.17.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ded11d2b-b4d6-3f7d-9014-a2742878dc13", "vendor": {"name": "localsend"}}], "isExploited": false}
