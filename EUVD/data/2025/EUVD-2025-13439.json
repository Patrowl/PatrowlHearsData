In version 1.0.0, OpenVM is vulnerable to overflow through byte decomposition of pc in AUIPC chip. A typo results in the highest limb of pc being range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This results in the if statement never being triggered because the enumeration gives i=0,1,2, when instead the enumeration should give i=1,2,3, leaving pc_limbs[3] range checked to 8-bits instead of 6-bits. This leads to a vulnerability where the pc_limbs decomposition differs from the true pc, which means a malicious prover can make the destination register take a different value than the AUIPC instruction dictates, by making the decomposition overflow the BabyBear field. This issue has been patched in version 1.1.0.", "datePublished": "2025-05-02T22:18:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T14:37:52", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/security/advisories/GHSA-jf2r-x3j4-23m7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46723", "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/commit/68da4b50c033da5603517064aa0a08e1bbf70a01", "https://cantina.xyz/code/c486d600-bed0-4fc6-aed1-de759fd29fa2/findings/21", "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm", "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/blob/0f94c8a3dfa7536c1231465d1bdee5fc607a5993/extensions/rv32im/circuit/src/auipc/core.rs#L135", "https://github.com/openvm-org/openvm/releases/tag/v1.1.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46723", "GHSA-jf2r-x3j4-23m7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db7d74cc-9998-3bb8-a900-1c99e843fb6e", "product": {"name": "openvm"}, "product_version": "= 1.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "40c66ba8-fe9d-38b5-8cba-ea81f8729f58", "vendor": {"name": "openvm-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
