An attacker who intercepts or captures a valid OTP response can bypass the OTP verification step by replaying the same response. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because, by design, the product successfully authenticates a client that possesses a cookie whose validity time interval includes the current time, and thus authentication after any type of \"interception\" is not a violation of the security model. (The cookie has the HttpOnly attribute.)", "datePublished": "2025-09-03T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-16T15:30:56", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://medium.com/@vigneshrajan54_88115/how-i-found-cve-2025-56689-in-safeguard-for-privileged-passwords-6d58fd4bf453"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-56689"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6a619188-b19c-3508-b8f7-5e46642e00c0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd04bd4b-24ab-309a-abcc-2a848b3f88d7", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
