Starting in version 0.0.125 and prior to version 0.1.24, when an account is deployed via a proxy, using regular Solidity to call its initialization function may result in a silent failure, if the initialization function does not return a `bool` or some other return data.  This is because regular Solidity uses `extcodesize(proxy)` to decide if call succeeds. This is insufficient in the case when the proxy points to an empty implementation. Users should upgrade to Solady v0.1.24 or later to receive a patch. Deploy any affected implementations and their factories on new EVM chains as soon as possible.", "datePublished": "2025-07-17T17:54:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-17T20:22:29", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/security/advisories/GHSA-8xvx-4mvg-m9v8", "https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/releases/tag/v0.1.24"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53638"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6dc25fed-e8e0-3391-97dd-86c7ef470f1b", "product": {"name": "solady"}, "product_version": "0.0.125, < 0.1.24"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "972470e4-bffa-3141-8b19-1db4050fa9e2", "vendor": {"name": "Vectorized"}}], "isExploited": false}
