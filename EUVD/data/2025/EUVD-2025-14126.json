Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass\noperations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().\n\nAlthough in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh,\nwe made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address\nfilters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast,\nand setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the\nfact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as\nkernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick\nhack.\n\nIt seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim\n.ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP\nin order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from\nrunning, although we could do that.\n\nAccepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option.\nEspecially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different\nangle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even\nfor VLANs:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/\n\nWhat happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails,\nthen the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.\n\nThis is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an\ninformational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see\nthat bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years'\nexperience, to justify the logic.", "datePublished": "2025-05-09T09:33:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-12T21:31:02", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86c6613a69bca815f1865ed8cedfd4b9142621ab", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8fcc1e6f808912977caf17366c625b95dc29ba4f", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/99c50c98803425378e08a7394dc885506dc85f06", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7afb5fb42d4950f33af2732b8147c552659f79b7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37864"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-37864"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "08856175-3b54-3327-8277-e6afde1040c2", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.14.4"}, {"id": "100084de-93d3-3b42-ac62-1ec57b3264ba", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "0832cd9f1f023226527e95002d537123061ddac4 <99c50c98803425378e08a7394dc885506dc85f06"}, {"id": "1be27649-4de1-3701-bac8-542a4e2d4f39", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.25"}, {"id": "384f012c-1395-31ec-86dc-077c59261e98", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.6.88"}, {"id": "4ac5adcb-c93b-3eb3-bf1e-63eb6e43c516", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "a1c2a060-8155-3103-89c9-8f0caca5fcb1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "0832cd9f1f023226527e95002d537123061ddac4 <86c6613a69bca815f1865ed8cedfd4b9142621ab"}, {"id": "a5dc4921-b520-3a93-88a3-6be81fe4716e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "0832cd9f1f023226527e95002d537123061ddac4 <8fcc1e6f808912977caf17366c625b95dc29ba4f"}, {"id": "ccde7909-13aa-32b2-8053-ac3ba4f0fe2c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "0832cd9f1f023226527e95002d537123061ddac4 <7afb5fb42d4950f33af2732b8147c552659f79b7"}, {"id": "e44a8aa3-f91c-3ac9-965e-33d7fb1f8c92", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.15-rc3"}, {"id": "e6683e20-6f4c-3906-8d50-32aa323ca06d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b96bb04-bd8d-3ffb-ae3a-6a18cad20403", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
