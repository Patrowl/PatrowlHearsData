This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the '/custom-font-code/custom-fonts-uploads.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2025-11-21T20:29:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T20:56:34", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11087", "https://themeforest.net/item/zegen-church-wordpress-theme/25116823", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/145deebd-1e15-4f8a-878c-9424c2cd9601?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11087", "GHSA-j59r-3c5p-26wm"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3362cb62-d5fc-3990-9578-26889001fdbc", "product": {"name": "Zegen Core"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c48e7951-8fba-3145-ad0c-ce5ddc878d52", "vendor": {"name": "zozothemes"}}], "isExploited": false}
