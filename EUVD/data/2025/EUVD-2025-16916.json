In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. This issue has been patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality.", "datePublished": "2025-05-30T05:21:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-04T20:49:45", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48881", "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/6ab04b30d3dab816bfea32d40ba50e5dd4517272", "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48881", "GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c290b4e-cb1c-38a2-ad40-74f2b147f1ff", "product": {"name": "valtimo-backend-libraries"}, "product_version": "12.0.0.RELEASE, < 12.13.0.RELEASE"}, {"id": "877c6038-279b-3251-a8e2-62b9eedaa9b8", "product": {"name": "valtimo-backend-libraries"}, "product_version": "11.0.0.RELEASE, \u2264 11.3.3.RELEASE"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7708093b-c9a3-3d99-a9c1-dc3eb9e97de0", "vendor": {"name": "valtimo-platform"}}], "isExploited": false}
