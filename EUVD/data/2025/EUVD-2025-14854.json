In versions starting from 6.4.8 to before 6.4.10, the allow/deny lists can be bypassed, allowing a user to change attributes that are intended to be unmodifiable by the user. It is possible to toggle the `external` flag on/off and change the own token value for a user. It is also possible to edit attributes that are not in the allow list, such as `otp_qr` and `otp_activated`. If external users exist in the OpenCTI setup and the information about these users identities is sensitive, the above vulnerabilities can be used to enumerate existing user accounts as a standard low privileged user. This issue has been patched in version 6.4.10.", "datePublished": "2025-04-30T18:27:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-30T19:06:07", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/GHSA-8262-pw2q-5qc3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24887"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19770894-a8c1-38f2-a8ed-139e0e74f050", "product": {"name": "opencti"}, "product_version": "6.4.8, < 6.4.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ad7dcaee-725c-34d0-8f7f-c651c510c8eb", "vendor": {"name": "OpenCTI-Platform"}}], "isExploited": false}
