From versions 0.13 to 0.19.1, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in AIDE. An attacker can crash the program during report printing or database listing after setting extended file attributes with an empty attribute value or with a key containing a comma. A local user might exploit this to cause a local denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 0.19.2. A workaround involves removing xattrs group from rules matching files on affected file systems.", "datePublished": "2025-08-14T15:52:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:12:46", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/aide/aide/security/advisories/GHSA-79g7-f8rv-jcxh", "https://github.com/aide/aide/commit/54a6d0d9d5f14b81961d66373c0291bf4af4135a", "https://github.com/aide/aide/releases/tag/v0.19.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54409"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bc0b1b91-1f54-3b2a-bb49-05cd8ea51c61", "product": {"name": "aide"}, "product_version": "0.13, < 0.19.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a1032aa-8c4d-3ec8-aecc-a5eae0719011", "vendor": {"name": "aide"}}], "isExploited": false}
