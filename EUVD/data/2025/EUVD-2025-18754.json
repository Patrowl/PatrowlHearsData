It implements a function to connect the watch to a WLAN. This function is mainly for downloading firmware files. Before downloading firmware files, the watch requests some information about the firmware via HTTPS from the back-end API. However, the X.509 server certificate within the TLS handshake is not validated by the device. This allows an attacker within an active machine-in-the-middle position, using a TLS proxy and a self-signed certificate, to eavesdrop and manipulate the HTTPS communication. This could be abused, for example, for stealing the API access token of the assigned user account.", "datePublished": "2025-06-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-20T14:49:41", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://syss.de", "https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/20087694119828-COROS-PACE-3-Release-Notes", "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2025-030.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32878"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a3a4a8b8-8d1e-369d-a476-80ca6b211831", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f58c1fc-7bdb-3267-856f-92e83ceb6737", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
