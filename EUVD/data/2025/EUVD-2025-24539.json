This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin, which is likely to be used alongside, allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, leading to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.", "datePublished": "2025-08-13T04:22:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-13T13:50:48", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/129f810d-ff83-4428-9f98-6a6aa8817783?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/contact-form-entries/tags/1.4.1/includes/data.php#L525", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3338764/#file9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7384"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bd5c1817-9e39-332c-a16f-3c164de798ea", "product": {"name": "Database for Contact Form 7, WPforms, Elementor forms"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.4.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b0ad8ae7-2d12-3c7c-974d-b853e6d4cd95", "vendor": {"name": "crmperks"}}], "isExploited": false}
