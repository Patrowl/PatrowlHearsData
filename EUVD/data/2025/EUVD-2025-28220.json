Prior to version 1.8.178, FreeScout is vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient validation of user input in the php_path parameter. The backticks characters are not removed, as well as tabulation is not removed. When checking user input, the file_exists function is also called to check for the presence of such a file (folder) in the file system. A user with the administrator role can create a translation for the language, which will create a folder in the file system. Further in tools.php, the user can specify the path to this folder as php_path, which will lead to the execution of code in backticks. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.178.", "datePublished": "2025-05-29T15:15:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-30T22:03:12", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-5324-cw55-gwj5", "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/fb33d672a2d67f5a2b3cf69c80945267f17908b2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48390"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1319b993-9f08-3841-b9f9-6eefc69e17c3", "product": {"name": "freescout"}, "product_version": "< 1.8.178"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67536c56-4525-3775-ad0a-38c8353e8e2e", "vendor": {"name": "freescout-help-desk"}}], "isExploited": false}
