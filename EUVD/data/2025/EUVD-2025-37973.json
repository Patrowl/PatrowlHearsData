The verification is unconditionally skipped when the POST body includes verification_override=1. Because this value is attacker-supplied, an unauthenticated actor can submit a forged IPN and have it treated as verified, even on production sites and with verification otherwise enabled. A valid PayPal transaction id is needed, restricting order manipulation to orders placed by the attacker.  This, in turn, requires them to have a customer account.", "datePublished": "2025-11-06T04:36:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-06T15:50:35", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4c63154e-9413-47ea-a740-441618266adf?source=cve", "https://github.com/awesomemotive/easy-digital-downloads/blob/main/includes/gateways/paypal/ipn.php", "https://github.com/awesomemotive/easy-digital-downloads/blob/main/src/Gateways/PayPal/IPN.php", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3382964%40easy-digital-downloads%2Ftrunk&old=3364285%40easy-digital-downloads%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11271"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11271"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c2f16a91-f7f5-35d2-9f83-6c8578bfa48e", "product": {"name": "Easy Digital Downloads \u2013 eCommerce Payments and Subscriptions made easy"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b260fa73-a33f-34de-9a9f-8df8eec69652", "vendor": {"name": "smub"}}], "isExploited": false}
