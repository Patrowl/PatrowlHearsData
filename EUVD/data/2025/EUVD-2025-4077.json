This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-07T22:38:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T17:15:09", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c", "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/360ece6f8873ef81afbfb98b25faad696ffccdb6", "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src", "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/2fc9bd476b0d9abcddb0a46f615a48333779d225/packages/app-desktop/plugins/GotoAnything.tsx#L558"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-25187"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19df64e1-72ee-359f-ab21-d3b97cd9a534", "product": {"name": "joplin"}, "product_version": "< 3.1.24"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "80a02555-0510-3843-98ef-8ba56f0c228d", "vendor": {"name": "laurent22"}}], "isExploited": false}
