To fix it just adjust the logic to ensure that the second `else`\nbranch is not taken if the first instruction will be patched to a `nop`.", "datePublished": "2025-07-25T15:30:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-19T18:31:16", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a24b00dcde83934a3cc13e4c6b775522903496b", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d90d9872edae7e78c3a12b98e239bfaa66f3639", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38433"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-38433"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1dd45fae-0c88-35c9-bc7a-d952b53c15cd", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.15.5"}, {"id": "5b70be28-ddcb-362b-a6fc-f00936d77510", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "66b36a2b-e26c-3e91-b2da-91cadee3e26c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "a44fb5722199de8338d991db5ad3d509192179bb <0a24b00dcde83934a3cc13e4c6b775522903496b"}, {"id": "7aee1223-0175-3c91-bb05-709f9b83a521", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16-rc4"}, {"id": "910f63ff-4253-334a-89c9-efb0f1f13667", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "a44fb5722199de8338d991db5ad3d509192179bb <8d90d9872edae7e78c3a12b98e239bfaa66f3639"}, {"id": "b3a3b096-c884-315d-9a3e-5d47586a45e6", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.15"}, {"id": "f6a4aab7-c6ab-3240-956a-e9e0d9286732", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "89d6bee0-1691-376c-804e-be8e33fa9665", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
