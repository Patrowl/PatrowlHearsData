In versions 0.23.0a8 and below, a high-severity vulnerability has been identified in the cicd.yml workflow within the astronomer/dag-factory GitHub repository. The workflow, specifically when triggered by pull_request_target, is susceptible to exploitation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the GitHub Actions runner environment. This misconfiguration enables an attacker to establish a reverse shell, exfiltrate sensitive secrets, including the highly-privileged GITHUB_TOKEN, and ultimately gain full control over the repository. This is fixed in version 0.23.0a9.", "datePublished": "2025-07-26T03:33:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-28T14:44:53", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/security/advisories/GHSA-g5hx-xv45-9whg", "https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/pull/460", "https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/pull/466", "https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/commit/751c0e58369e784f6a924347e381a705ea8133fe"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54415"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "435135f5-1cca-3418-8632-eff47017bc83", "product": {"name": "dag-factory"}, "product_version": "< 0.23.0a9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d36fc1f6-6512-33ee-b2a5-f378280adbf8", "vendor": {"name": "astronomer"}}], "isExploited": false}
