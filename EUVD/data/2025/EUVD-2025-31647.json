For versions 8.17.1 and below, when libvips is compiled with support for PDF input via poppler, the pdfload operation is affected by a buffer read overflow when parsing the header of a crafted PDF with a page that defines a width but not a height. Those using libvips compiled without support for PDF input are unaffected as well as thosewith support for PDF input via PDFium. This issue is fixed in version 8.17.2. A workaround for those affected is to block the VipsForeignLoadPdf operation via vips_operation_block_set, which is available in most language bindings, or to set VIPS_BLOCK_UNTRUSTED environment variable at runtime, which will block all untrusted loaders including PDF input via poppler.", "datePublished": "2025-09-29T22:04:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-24T14:49:49", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/libvips/libvips/security/advisories/GHSA-q8px-4w5q-c2r4", "https://github.com/libvips/libvips/commit/a58bfae9223a5466cc81ba9fe6dfb08233cf17d1", "https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases/tag/v8.17.2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59933"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "026eaa19-604e-3c90-86f6-54f273009d4a", "product": {"name": "libvips"}, "product_version": "< 8.17.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3e7990f8-6422-3019-af78-86a8a1929c77", "vendor": {"name": "libvips"}}], "isExploited": false}
