At [1] we have end_buffer_size = 0x100000, and at [2] we have end_buffer_pos = 0x1000.\n\nThe loop then scans backwards through the buffer looking for the dhav\u00a0tag; when it is found, we'll calculate end_pos\u00a0based on a 32-bit offset read from the buffer.\n\nThere is subsequently a check [3] that end_pos\u00a0is within the section of the file that has been copied into end_buffer, but it only correctly handles the cases where end_pos\u00a0is before the start of the file\u00a0or after the section copied into end_buffer, and not the case where end_pos\u00a0is within the the file, but before the section copied into end_buffer. If we provide such an offset, (end_pos - end_buffer_pos)\u00a0can underflow, resulting in the subsequent access at [4] occurring before the beginning of the allocation.\n\nWe recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.", "datePublished": "2025-10-06T08:08:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-06T16:28:37", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:L/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59729", "https://issuetracker.google.com/433513232"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59729", "GHSA-j8h4-v947-5h7q"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "401a9638-2e34-33de-ad9b-7884ea61ac06", "product": {"name": "FFmpeg"}, "product_version": "a218cafe4d3be005ab0c61130f90db4d21afb5db <8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2b229c90-ce84-3058-8851-d42ad124e575", "vendor": {"name": "FFMPEG"}}], "isExploited": false}
