For each ping packet the SSH server receives, a pong packet is allocated in a memory buffer and stored in a queue of packages. It is only freed when the server/client key exchange has finished. A malicious client may keep sending such packages, leading to an uncontrolled increase in memory consumption on the server side. Consequently, the server may become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service attack.", "datePublished": "2025-02-28T21:25:28", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-06T23:33:10", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26466", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-26466", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345043", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250228-0002", "https://www.qualys.com/2025/02/18/openssh-mitm-dos.txt", "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1237041", "https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-26466", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-26466", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/18/1", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/02/18/4", "https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2025/q1/144", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/May/7", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/May/8", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Feb/18"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-26466", "GHSA-m92w-x6j2-5gc5"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 46.66, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3dcf4ea3-4160-3187-a94d-2b785ffdc068", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
