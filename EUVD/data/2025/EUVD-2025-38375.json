This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-11-08T09:28:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-10T14:14:08", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/39972b06-920f-48b0-aa36-bb5caab87cb6?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3390065/cyan-backup/tags/2.5.5/includes/page-backups.php", "https://github.com/toolstack/cyan-backup/commit/4a79d23e8ba330b5cb655a083c6a00ef32a7b249", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12092"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12092"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8f33a201-5884-3500-b4d0-f99e92d6a1ba", "product": {"name": "CYAN Backup"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.5.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0bc74fd3-2c49-3bf8-b7e4-fed933a19adf", "vendor": {"name": "GregRoss"}}], "isExploited": false}
