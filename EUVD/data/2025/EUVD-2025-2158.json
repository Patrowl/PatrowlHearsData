An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-01-08T16:19:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T20:30:37", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-xss-CDOJZyH", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xwork-xss-KCcg7WwU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20166"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "23cb2abe-7d2f-3e6b-b1b2-22178c95158b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11"}, {"id": "84642f04-759c-3f0b-b173-e0a8ed36ef9b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "30.1.1-0"}, {"id": "aacf8d2c-bb4e-3626-8a0d-9b9f1154ff6c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.2"}, {"id": "cbae63fc-e957-377f-b4fd-c630b4bce9ce", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.1"}, {"id": "d6596d65-f9d0-39a3-a27f-1c59290066a4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f682e101-9302-3044-8de5-8084b561d0e9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
