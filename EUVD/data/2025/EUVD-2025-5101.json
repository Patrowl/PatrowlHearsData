A DLL hijacking vulnerability in Rufus 4.6.2208 and earlier versions allows an attacker loading and executing a malicious DLL with escalated privileges (since the executable has been granted higher privileges during the time of launch) due to the ability to inject a malicious `cfgmgr32.dll` in the same directory as the executable and have it side load automatically. This is fixed in commit `74dfa49`, which will be part of version 4.7. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as version 4.7 becomes available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T22:40:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-19T15:02:27", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/security/advisories/GHSA-p8p5-r296-g2jv", "https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/74dfa49707fd626b58d776d3400295740a29e23e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-26624"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b5bf7188-a736-335d-8be3-b12016b0b39a", "product": {"name": "Rufus"}, "product_version": "< 4.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01f6ee7f-3c03-3586-bffa-36b24db11499", "vendor": {"name": "pbatard"}}], "isExploited": false}
