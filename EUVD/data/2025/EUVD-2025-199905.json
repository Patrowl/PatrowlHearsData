From version 5.0 to 5.7, the application does not invalidate existing sessions when a user is disabled or when a password change occurs, allowing active session cookies to remain valid indefinitely. As a result, a disabled user, or an attacker using a compromised account, can continue to access protected pages and perform operations as long as a prior session remains active. Because the server performs no session revocation or session-store cleanup during these critical state changes, disabling an account or updating credentials has no effect on already-established sessions. This makes administrative disable actions ineffective and allows unauthorized users to retain full access even after an account is closed or a password is reset, exposing the system to prolonged unauthorized use and significantly increasing the impact of account takeover scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 5.8.", "datePublished": "2025-11-29T03:06:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-01T21:05:42", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/orangehrm/orangehrm/security/advisories/GHSA-99qp-xh4q-pr9x"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-66289"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8cd62413-478a-3c76-997f-46078610e055", "product": {"name": "orangehrm"}, "product_version": "5.0, < 5.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "acc70791-4890-33e1-a32f-8bad21620a25", "vendor": {"name": "orangehrm"}}], "isExploited": false}
