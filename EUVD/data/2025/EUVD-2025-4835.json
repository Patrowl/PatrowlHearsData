This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T04:21:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-18T15:35:07", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13677", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/get-bookings-wp/trunk/classes/user.php", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6b0dc03-3715-41f8-8888-1cccddb39c0b?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13677", "GHSA-36w5-5r4m-f2m6"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9806e7cb-e9fd-3986-b3f0-e46ab35c9613", "product": {"name": "GetBookingsWP \u2013 Appointments Booking Calendar Plugin For WordPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1.27"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9b315b2f-dbab-3183-9e0c-d76b2e11d42c", "vendor": {"name": "istmoplugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
