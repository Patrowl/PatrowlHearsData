An attacker can exploit the vulnerability in the following two scenarios: a victim visits a malicious website controlled by the attacker and the website redirect to the URL automatically, or a victim clicks on such a crafted link embedded on a legitimate website (e.g., in user-generated content). In both cases, the browser invokes Dive's custom URL handler (dive:), which launches the Dive app and processes the crafted URL, leading to arbitrary code execution on the victim\u2019s machine. This vulnerability is caused by improper processing of custom url. This is fixed in version 0.9.4.", "datePublished": "2025-09-03T03:52:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-03T15:44:22", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/security/advisories/GHSA-2r34-7pgx-vvrc", "https://github.com/OpenAgentPlatform/Dive/commit/acae6d40354d380f69f8241e9122a43ff64cff11"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58176"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6957c6ba-8403-3570-947f-97a04c4d8f2f", "product": {"name": "Dive"}, "product_version": "0.9.0, < 0.9.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "14c0847d-e683-3484-8551-6ef9c3e469ca", "vendor": {"name": "OpenAgentPlatform"}}], "isExploited": false}
