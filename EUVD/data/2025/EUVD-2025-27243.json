The vulnerability is isolated to the SMPP server, which operates with its own dedicated database, separate from the main software's database. This isolation limits the scope of the vulnerability to the SMPP server's operations. The vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of user input in the SMPP server's scripts.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in version 6.11.", "datePublished": "2025-09-09T09:59:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-11T15:13:38", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/08/CVE-2025-10095", "https://www.smseagle.eu/security-advisory/resolved-sql-injection-in-smpp-component-of-smseagle-software-6-11/", "https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/09/CVE-2025-10095"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10095"], "assigner": "CERT-PL", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fda47f7-d5c4-33cd-b99e-f6104208aaba", "product": {"name": "SMSEagle"}, "product_version": "0 <6.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3602f249-7120-3a86-8f39-6fe203a7fc9d", "vendor": {"name": "Proximus sp. z o.o."}}], "isExploited": false}
