LAM before 9.3 allows stored cross-site scripting in the Profile section via the profile name field, which renders untrusted input as HTML and executes a supplied script (for example a script element). An authenticated user with permission to create or edit a profile can insert a script payload into the profile name and have it executed when the profile data is viewed in a browser. This issue is fixed in version 9.3. No known workarounds are mentioned.", "datePublished": "2025-09-16T16:29:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-16T18:26:38", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/security/advisories/GHSA-6gqg-wm9x-5x3m"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58174"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "94e62b69-8bd0-3d23-aafc-8c6e1e249cd8", "product": {"name": "lam"}, "product_version": "< 9.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a9cfcccd-1925-3a48-909f-d93db14bfb96", "vendor": {"name": "LDAPAccountManager"}}], "isExploited": false}
