This is due to missing nonce validation on the \"post_add_to_list\" function as well as an incorrect permissions callback in the \"Api/init\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add or remove products from a user's wishlist via a forged request granted they can trick a site's user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2025-12-03T12:29:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-03T13:58:46", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6ed605a1-9544-4b53-8d62-ad89214a4fb8?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3401226/shopengine", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12358"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12358"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "689f07c6-309d-396f-8d4e-6796701bd38b", "product": {"name": "ShopEngine Elementor WooCommerce Builder Addon \u2013 All in One WooCommerce Solution"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.8.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "999a838b-df1e-3dcb-b4ed-81867e7eee1a", "vendor": {"name": "Roxnor"}}], "isExploited": false}
