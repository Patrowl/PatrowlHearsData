When PMU drivers later attempt to use this\nnegative index as a shift exponent in bitwise operations, it leads to UBSAN\nshift-out-of-bounds reports.\n\nThe issue is a logical flaw in how event groups handle throttling when some\nmembers are intentionally disabled. Based on the analysis and the\nreproducer provided by Mark Rutland (this issue on both arm64 and x86-64).\n\nThe scenario unfolds as follows:\n\n 1. A group leader event is configured with a very aggressive sampling\n    period (e.g., sample_period = 1). This causes frequent interrupts and\n    triggers the throttling mechanism.\n 2. A child event in the same group is created in a disabled state\n    (.disabled = 1). This event remains in PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF.\n    Since it hasn't been scheduled onto the PMU, its event->hw.idx remains\n    initialized at -1.\n 3. When throttling occurs, perf_event_throttle_group() and later\n    perf_event_unthrottle_group() iterate through all siblings, including\n    the disabled child event.\n 4. perf_event_throttle()/unthrottle() are called on this inactive child\n    event, which then call event->pmu->start()/stop().\n 5. The PMU driver receives the event with hw.idx == -1 and attempts to\n    use it as a shift exponent. e.g., in macros like PMCNTENSET(idx),\n    leading to the UBSAN report.\n\nThe throttling mechanism attempts to start/stop events that are not\nactively scheduled on the hardware.\n\nMove the state check into perf_event_throttle()/perf_event_unthrottle() so\nthat inactive events are skipped entirely. This ensures only active events\nwith a valid hw.idx are processed, preventing undefined behavior and\nsilencing UBSAN warnings. The corrected check ensures true before\nproceeding with PMU operations.\n\nThe problem can be reproduced with the syzkaller reproducer:", "datePublished": "2025-09-16T15:32:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-02T21:31:27", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d689135aa9c5e4e0eab5a92bbe35dab0c8d6677f", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b64fdd422a85025b5e91ead794db9d3ef970e369", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39821"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-39821"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0063a8e4-b46d-3bb4-bbd8-03aca1ae47a9", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16.5"}, {"id": "35ef1e27-82ce-3725-b9f4-a3c51a719f11", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17-rc3"}, {"id": "3ae9c93e-eb09-3674-820b-9609a65b063a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "4a92e1f0-67fb-3617-8d7f-54739695f664", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.16"}, {"id": "5201a6f9-94a5-3585-adc1-7d330bfa0b23", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9734e25fbf5ae68eb04234b2cd14a4b36ab89141 <d689135aa9c5e4e0eab5a92bbe35dab0c8d6677f"}, {"id": "bc97967f-6fe8-3794-8bd1-816f0147d046", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9734e25fbf5ae68eb04234b2cd14a4b36ab89141 <b64fdd422a85025b5e91ead794db9d3ef970e369"}, {"id": "feae35f4-85bd-32a3-a457-3fa4ccb111ae", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "18546a25-f491-3d36-9c41-619b0d352f02", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
