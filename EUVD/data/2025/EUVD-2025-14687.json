This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web protection mechanism on affected installations of PeaZip. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of archived files. When extracting files from a crafted archive that bears the Mark-of-the-Web, PeaZip does not propagate the Mark-of-the-Web to the extracted files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. NOTE: this is disputed because Mark-of-the-Web propagation can increase risk via security-warning habituation, and because the intended control sphere for file-origin metadata (e.g., HostUrl in Zone.Identifier) may be narrower than that for reading the file's content.", "datePublished": "2025-04-15T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-24T19:20:48", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://peazip.github.io/peazip-64bit.html", "https://github.com/EnisAksu/Argonis/blob/main/CVEs/CVE-2025-33026%20%28PeaZip%29/CVE-2025-33026.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-33026"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "843a3f9e-e608-331e-adae-89a2919abb04", "product": {"name": "PeaZip"}, "product_version": "0 \u226410.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9f6ef775-9515-3295-a460-77a5948656c5", "vendor": {"name": "PeaZip"}}], "isExploited": false}
