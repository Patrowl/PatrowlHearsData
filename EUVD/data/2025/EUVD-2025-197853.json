Since version 4.12.0, Dependency-Track users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission can configure a \"welcome message\", which is HTML that is to be rendered on the login page for branding purposes. When rendering the welcome message, Dependency-Track versions before 4.13.6 did not properly sanitize the HTML, allowing arbitrary JavaScript to be executed. Users with the SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission (i.e., administrators), can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary JavaScript for users browsing to the login page.
