Starting in version 2.49.0 and prior to version 2.67.0, under certain conditions, a bug in GitHub's Artifact Attestation cli tool `gh attestation verify` causes it to return a zero exit status when no attestations are present. This behavior is incorrect: When no attestations are present, `gh attestation verify` should return a non-zero exit status code, thereby signaling verification failure. An attacker can abuse this flaw to, for example, deploy malicious artifacts in any system that uses `gh attestation verify`'s exit codes to gatekeep deployments. Users are advised to update `gh` to patched version `v2.67.0` as soon as possible.", "datePublished": "2025-02-14T16:38:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-03T19:13:28", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cli/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-fgw4-v983-mgp8", "https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/10418", "https://github.com/cli/cli/pull/10421", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25204"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-25204"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "37369eb7-2e61-37df-b28f-2f570d54ad88", "product": {"name": "cli"}, "product_version": "2.49.0, < 2.67.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "12386222-706f-3988-9602-f1ab74ed49c4", "vendor": {"name": "cli"}}], "isExploited": false}
