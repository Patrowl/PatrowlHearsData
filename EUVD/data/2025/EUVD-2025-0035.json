Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs.", "datePublished": "2025-01-03T16:11:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-03T17:22:04", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/security/advisories/GHSA-mg7w-c9x2-xh7r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-56513", "https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/pull/5793", "https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada/commit/2c82055c4c7f469411b1ba48c4dba4841df04831", "https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada", "https://karmada.io/docs/administrator/security/component-permission"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-56513", "GHSA-mg7w-c9x2-xh7r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ffc02a9-c1d9-3dbe-ba2c-c2f53ba7e18f", "product": {"name": "karmada"}, "product_version": "< 1.12.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53473e06-3a48-3e1d-bb00-7e05186b08e3", "vendor": {"name": "karmada-io"}}], "isExploited": false}
