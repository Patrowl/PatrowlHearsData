It allows people to temporarily switch to another user account. The module provides a \"Masquerade as admin\" permission to restrict people (who can masquerade) from switching to an account with administrative privileges. This permission is not always honored and may allow non-administrative users to masquerade as an administrator. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a role with the \"Masquerade as user\" permission.", "datePublished": "2025-03-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-07T22:29:21", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-contrib-2025-006"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27822"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ae6fabcb-1d3e-3e7f-ae4f-49cae28ce32c", "product": {"name": "Masquerade"}, "product_version": "0 <1.x-1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "59aeffe5-7c05-3c39-aed4-18d8aa66e695", "vendor": {"name": "backdropcms"}}], "isExploited": false}
