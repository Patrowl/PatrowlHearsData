The user interface may possibly be publicly accessible with umatiGateway's provided docker-compose file. With this access, the configuration can be viewed and altered. Commit 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16 uses `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` to limit access to the local network. For those who are unable to use this proposed patch, a firewall on Port 8080 may block remote access, but the workaround may not be perfect because Docker may also bypass a firewall by its iptable based rules for port forwarding.", "datePublished": "2025-03-10T18:47:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-10T19:05:29", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/security/advisories/GHSA-qf9w-x9qx-2mq7", "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/pull/101", "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/commit/5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16", "https://github.com/umati/umatiGateway/blob/abe73096a17307327f0d6dc0ed4db1fb93464521/README.md?plain=1#L34-L35"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27615"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ada1b251-61f9-3cd6-9bbf-0f33cce23688", "product": {"name": "umatiGateway"}, "product_version": "< 5d81a3412bc0051754a3095d89a06d6d743f2b16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a7142c89-ce59-39ce-afa3-36aad8f79738", "vendor": {"name": "umati"}}], "isExploited": false}
