Starting in version 2.17.0 and prior to version 2.19.1, a flaw in the authentication bypass logic allows unauthenticated requests to match certain unanchored regex patterns in the URL. Attackers can craft URLs containing substrings like \"/api/items/1/cover\" in a query parameter (?r=/api/items/1/cover) to partially bypass authentication or trigger server crashes under certain routes. This could lead to information disclosure of otherwise protected data and, in some cases, a complete denial of service (server crash) if downstream code expects an authenticated user object. Version 2.19.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-02-12T18:16:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T14:14:25", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/security/advisories/GHSA-pg8v-5jcv-wrvw", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/pull/3584", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/bf8407274e3ee300af1927ee660d078a7a801e1c", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/commit/ec6537656925a43871b07cfee12c9f383844d224", "https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf/blob/1a3d70d04100924d41391acb55bd8ddca486a4fa/server/Auth.js#L17-L41"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-25205"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.63, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d595d472-30ca-3a5a-825e-d6aa6835e968", "product": {"name": "audiobookshelf"}, "product_version": "2.17.0, < 2.19.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d3bdb127-641a-3f65-ad6d-86e9f3be4454", "vendor": {"name": "advplyr"}}], "isExploited": false}
