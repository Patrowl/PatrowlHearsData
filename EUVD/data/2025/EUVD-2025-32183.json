The channel parsing code can be found in decode_header.\u00a0The buffer td->uncompressed_data\u00a0is allocated in decode_block\u00a0based on the xsize, ysize\u00a0and computed current_channel_offset.\n\nThe function dwa_uncompress\u00a0then assumes at [5] that if there are 4 channels, these are \"B\", \"G\", \"R\"\u00a0and \"A\", and in the calculations at [6] and [7] that all channels are of the same type, which matches the type of the main color channels.\n\nIf we set the main color channels to a 4-byte type and add duplicate or unknown channels of the 2-byte EXR_HALF\u00a0type, then the addition at [7] will increment the pointer by 4-bytes * xsize * nb_channels, which will exceed the allocated buffer.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recommend upgrading to version 8.0 or beyond.", "datePublished": "2025-10-06T08:09:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-19T14:52:14", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59733", "https://b.corp.google.com/issues/436511754", "https://issuetracker.google.com/436511754"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59733", "GHSA-hpfq-c235-5854"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c3c67981-141d-3212-9129-97cf4ca71595", "product": {"name": "FFmpeg"}, "product_version": "9a32b863074ed4140141e0d3613905c6f1fe61c5 <8.0"}, {"id": "f08e8ec5-0068-3f46-9d7e-f1552ff68246", "product": {"name": "FFmpeg"}, "product_version": "7.1.1 <8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "971d5a8f-be35-3739-b96c-0b706857ee36", "vendor": {"name": "FFMPEG"}}], "isExploited": false}
