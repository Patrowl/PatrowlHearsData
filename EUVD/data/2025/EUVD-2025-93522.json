Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated user combined with a high complexity attack may enable local code execution. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires active user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (high) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T16:49:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T04:55:39", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01362.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24327"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24327"], "assigner": "intel", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b45edb8-901a-3c20-b110-94d6dee2b4ab", "product": {"name": "Intel(R) Rapid Storage Technology Application"}, "product_version": "before version 20.0.1021"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4d5d753-16f7-3b4d-8a55-471a1aec5ced", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
