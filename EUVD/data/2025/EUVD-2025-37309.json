This is due to insufficient input validation in the zf_get_file_by_url function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files like /etc/passwd, via a forged request. It's worth noting that successfully exploiting this vulnerability relies on a race condition as the file generated will be deleted immediately.", "datePublished": "2025-10-31T07:26:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-01T15:36:09", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ef9010e3-f060-4bef-b62b-4a648f5e5577?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/boombox-viral-buzz-wordpress-theme/16596434", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-8385"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-8385"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2168c09e-79d3-35f0-aca7-8357877d4554", "product": {"name": "Zombify"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.7.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7c6af84-ce6e-31e9-8462-1c82682a8d6b", "vendor": {"name": "PX-lab"}}], "isExploited": false}
