This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-06-05T05:23:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-05T14:07:57", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eeb71c31-9e56-4b58-9cfc-a97f6892cc2b?source=cve", "https://headwayapp.co/wp-user-frontend-changelog", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3055"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3055"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "159e9298-500c-39ba-82e2-62cdb2fd880d", "product": {"name": "WP User Frontend Pro"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.1.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f4d4fec-ca4c-3a7e-be83-081fd14f4c5b", "vendor": {"name": "wedevs"}}], "isExploited": false}
