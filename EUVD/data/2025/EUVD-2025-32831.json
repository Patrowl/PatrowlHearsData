Memory allocated for page table entries\nnot released during process termination. This issue can be reproduced by\na small program that allocates a large amount of memory. After several\nruns, you'll see that the amount of free memory has reduced and will\ncontinue to reduce after each run. All ARC CPUs are effected by this\nissue. The issue was introduced since the kernel stable release v5.15-rc1.\n\nAs described in commit d9820ff after switch pgtable_t back to struct\npage *, a pointer to \"struct page\" and appropriate functions are used to\nallocate and free a memory page for PTEs, but the pmd_pgtable macro hasn't\nchanged and returns the direct virtual address from the PMD (PGD) entry.\nThan this address used as a parameter in the __pte_free() and as a result\nthis function couldn't release memory page allocated for PTEs.\n\nFix this issue by changing the pmd_pgtable macro and returning pointer to\nstruct page.", "datePublished": "2025-10-01T11:45:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-01T11:45:20", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50446", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14009ada5712649589ab4ad0441b811780ea8773", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4fd9df10cb7a9289fbd22d669f9f98164d95a1ce", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d83a69966e8b6ae9dd447f3ac704c0223bceb7f7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-50446", "GHSA-wpvw-hhw9-p3qj"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "063d3d93-6b34-31f7-8a05-8762b9d18209", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "d9820ff76f95fa26d33e412254a89cd65b23142d <d83a69966e8b6ae9dd447f3ac704c0223bceb7f7"}, {"id": "0ffedbb0-2681-38c6-8dee-05eeaea8f482", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1"}, {"id": "64ee98df-7fd9-38cb-ac0e-bafdb3475c45", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "d9820ff76f95fa26d33e412254a89cd65b23142d <4fd9df10cb7a9289fbd22d669f9f98164d95a1ce"}, {"id": "8b15d0ee-36a5-30c5-b188-e8080e38a843", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "d9820ff76f95fa26d33e412254a89cd65b23142d <14009ada5712649589ab4ad0441b811780ea8773"}, {"id": "925e74b0-9d10-3df0-b4b0-938b41ad0e3b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "e52847ff-2dd4-3c25-b6d2-15df6e89c802", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.15.77"}, {"id": "eedd4889-114e-38f5-9770-6f321e005ba1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.0.7"}, {"id": "eee4da8d-96ca-3a71-a613-f7a52e0e73ad", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "18f3fb52-55fb-3f8c-a175-a83967ac2b38", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
