The fetched script conditionally loaded follow-on modules that performed extensive ad substitution and malvertising, displayed fake \u201crepair\u201d alerts that redirected users to affiliate programs, and attempted to harvest credentials when users logged in. Injected components enumerate common banner sizes for substitution, replace third-party ad calls, and redirect victim traffic to affiliate landing pages. Potential impacts include\u00a0user-level code execution in the browser context, large-scale ad fraud and traffic hijacking, credential theft, and exposure to additional payloads delivered by the actor.\u00a0The compromise was reported on by the maintainer of Web Developer for Chrome on August 2, 2017 and remediated in v0.5.0.", "datePublished": "2025-10-08T22:04:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-14T14:18:49", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-20202", "https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm?pli=1", "https://gist.github.com/piedpiperRichard/076516da60f45842f1a6e6ae35a9a240", "https://ui.vision/blog/chrome-extension-adware", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170803163618/https://chrispederick.com/blog/web-developer-for-chrome-compromised", "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/threat-actor-goes-chrome-extension-hijacking-spree", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/web-developer-for-chrome-malicious-backdoor-supply-chain-compromise", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170803163618/https://chrispederick.com/blog/web-developer-for-chrome-compromised/", "https://ui.vision/blog/chrome-extension-adware/", "https://gist.github.com/piedpiperRichard/076516da60f45842f1a6e6ae35a9a240/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2017-20202", "GHSA-vwvp-p3cc-rrj2"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3983e772-38c2-354d-8e2b-d612a98b2bc5", "product": {"name": "Web Developer for Chrome"}, "product_version": "0.4.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cc8c9b31-513f-3364-9616-62ff8eb36c53", "vendor": {"name": "Web Developer for Chrome"}}], "isExploited": false}
