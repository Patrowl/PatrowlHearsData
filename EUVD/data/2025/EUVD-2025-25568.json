To respond to the probe deferral return, the CLK_DMA clock\nwas disabled, and this led to parent clocks also reducing their enable\ncount.  When the enable count for pll1_d8 was decremented it became 0,\nwhich caused it to be disabled.  This led to a system hang.\n\nMarking that clock critical resolves this by preventing it from being\ndisabled.\n\nDefine a new macro CCU_FACTOR_GATE_DEFINE() to allow clock flags to\nbe supplied for a CCU_FACTOR_GATE clock.", "datePublished": "2025-08-22T18:31:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-26T18:31:00", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10948c00e548e9ad2ce9d765baf26dce2d9b806b", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7554729de27daf6d54bcf8689d863bbe267828bf", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38633"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-38633"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "75349d81-d8b8-3d6f-a93b-b29aaf68e9b6", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16.1"}, {"id": "aef1141d-de34-3581-90d6-c04d57057cce", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1b72c59db0add8e47fa116b21f78ed0b09a264f3 <7554729de27daf6d54bcf8689d863bbe267828bf"}, {"id": "b38fc195-541f-37b1-8583-bf9bac71e6ad", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1b72c59db0add8e47fa116b21f78ed0b09a264f3 <10948c00e548e9ad2ce9d765baf26dce2d9b806b"}, {"id": "d15b2057-6f23-3420-adef-2941fab9d393", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17"}, {"id": "e9f271ae-2961-3fd9-ab1e-48ac926f3261", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "ece17986-e6e0-3f8c-82ba-f648e9560c53", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.16"}, {"id": "fbbcbf87-92f8-33c6-9cd3-10d6b4e08951", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17-rc1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c61ee7ed-b75f-3254-8a99-4241ac536309", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
