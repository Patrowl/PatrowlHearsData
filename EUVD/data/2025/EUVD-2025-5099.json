{"id": "EUVD-2025-5099", "enisaUuid": "583882ca-117d-3e34-8dbd-257609f20911", "description": "Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Vim allows to redirect screen messages using the `:redir` ex command to register, variables and files. It also allows to show the contents of registers using the `:registers` or `:display` ex command. When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T19:04:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-19T15:15:59", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-63p5-mwg2-787v", "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/c0f0e2380e5954f4a52a131bf6b8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-26603"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "93185bf8-f808-39ee-b0b6-e0f4a94b40f6", "product": {"name": "vim"}, "product_version": "< 9.1.1115"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0ee48a12-19dc-3bd3-b1e0-1a48c5aed295", "vendor": {"name": "vim"}}], "isExploited": false}
