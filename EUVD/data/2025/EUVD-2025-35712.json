This issue stems from the /etc/passwd file being created with group-writable permissions during build time. In certain conditions, an attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, can leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.", "datePublished": "2025-10-23T20:10:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-06T23:40:27", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-57848", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2391099", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-57848"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-57848"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "104c43a3-114f-3b39-8812-ad177577f792", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
