Once inside, the attacker can modify critical weather parameters such as wind shear alerts, inversion depth, and CAPE values, which are essential for accurate weather forecasting and flight safety. This unauthorized access could result in the disabling of vital alerts, causing hazardous conditions for aircraft, and manipulating runway assignments, which could result in mid-air conflicts or runway incursions.", "datePublished": "2025-11-04T16:10:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-05T14:34:04", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61945", "https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsa-25-308-04.json", "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-308-04"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61945", "GHSA-q4wg-4r43-jqjx"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13096a38-4f7f-34c8-b2cb-b24339a0c1b9", "product": {"name": "VizAir"}, "product_version": "0 <08/2025"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23b3c4dd-6fa0-3b26-8b9c-beed475e01dd", "vendor": {"name": "Radiometrics"}}], "isExploited": false}
