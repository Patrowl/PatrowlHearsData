An unauthenticated attacker could invoke the same URL used by the product's default-installation / first-admin creation page and create a new administrative account remotely. By gaining admin privileges, the attacker can change the ATM configuration resulting in redirected funds. Public vendor advisories and multiple independent writeups describe the vulnerability as a call to the page used for initial/default installation / first administration user creation; General Bytes has not publicly published the exact endpoint/parameter name. The issue was actively exploited in the wild against cloud-hosted and standalone CAS deployments (scanning exposed CAS instances on ports 7777/443), and publicly acknowledged by the General Bytes in September 2022.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T18:55:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T16:07:20", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-4980", "https://generalbytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESD/pages/2785509377/Security%2BIncident%2B", "https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/08/23/bitcoin-atms-leeched-by-attackers-who-created-fake-admin-accounts", "https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/hackers-stole-crypto-from-bitcoin-atms.html", "https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-general-bytes-bitcoin-atm-hack-august-2022", "https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/publications/cybersecurity-highlights/0day-vulnerability-exploited-general-bytes", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/general-bytes-cas-unauth-creation-of-admin-account-via-default-installation-first-admin-page", "https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/08/23/bitcoin-atms-leeched-by-attackers-who-created-fake-admin-accounts/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-4980", "GHSA-2wf3-7j9f-p79x"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6c7d26d1-69f1-3c9f-8c0d-72f38961a0e3", "product": {"name": "Crypto Application Server (CAS)"}, "product_version": "20201208 <20220531.38"}, {"id": "bae5e2b0-9b95-3091-8a23-4682eb2ea2d0", "product": {"name": "Crypto Application Server (CAS)"}, "product_version": "20201208 <20220725.22"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "909bf0b4-d8ff-3b4d-9623-362f431d4d1e", "vendor": {"name": "General Bytes"}}], "isExploited": false}
