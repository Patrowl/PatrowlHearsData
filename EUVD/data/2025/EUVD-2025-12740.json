In versions starting from 15.9-rc-1 to before 15.10.8 and from 16.0.0-rc-1 to before 16.2.0, the required rights analysis doesn't consider TextAreas with default content type. When editing a page, XWiki warns since version 15.9 when there is content on the page like a script macro that would gain more rights due to the editing. This analysis doesn't consider certain kinds of properties, allowing a user to put malicious scripts in there that will be executed after a user with script, admin, or programming rights edited the page. Such a malicious script could impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This issue has been patched in versions 15.10.8 and 16.2.0.", "datePublished": "2025-04-30T14:55:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-30T15:15:51", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-mvgm-3rw2-7j4r", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32974", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/153dbfa2ef1a7a0a644fe3f889684c6a8738c5fc", "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform", "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22002"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32974", "GHSA-mvgm-3rw2-7j4r"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e9e1511-4248-31df-ba54-093a4bd481ad", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "16.0.0-rc-1, < 16.2.0"}, {"id": "6392e691-ef3c-300c-aae2-08be9b6f37f6", "product": {"name": "xwiki-platform"}, "product_version": "15.9-rc-1, < 15.10.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b87e4e09-ab4f-3384-8292-aaa429446233", "vendor": {"name": "xwiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
