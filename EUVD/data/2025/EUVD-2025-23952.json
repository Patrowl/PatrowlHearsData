There is a vulnerability in SuiteCRM version 7.14.6 which allows unauthenticated downloads of any file from the upload-directory, as long as it is named by an ID (e.g. attachments). An unauthenticated attacker could download internal files when he discovers a valid file-ID.\nValid IDs could be brute-forced, but this is quite time-consuming as the file-IDs are usually UUIDs.
