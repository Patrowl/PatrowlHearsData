An attacker with the ability to monitor network traffic could therefore obtain sensitive information or tamper with the traffic to control affected devices. This affects YoLink Hub 0382, YoLink Mobile Application 1.40.41, and YoLink MQTT Broker. NOTE: The vendor states that the vulnerability described (related to insecure transmission) only impacts the legacy mobile application logic, not the Hub hardware or firmware. The Hub functions solely as a pass-through (transparent gateway) for LoRa wireless data and does not inspect or process the application layer data.", "datePublished": "2025-10-06T21:30:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-26T18:31:03", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59448", "https://bishopfox.com/blog/advisories", "https://bishopfox.com/blog/how-a-20-smart-device-gave-me-access-to-your-home", "https://shop.yosmart.com/pages/product-support", "https://shop.yosmart.com/pages/sa-2025-001"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59448", "GHSA-wvrh-5769-mm5j"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ecfde788-1bbc-3e11-836d-e873bdd641af", "product": {"name": "YoLink ecosystem"}, "product_version": "0 \u22642025-10-02"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23e5bbdb-e043-391d-a6b5-08e1cafead08", "vendor": {"name": "YoSmart"}}], "isExploited": false}
