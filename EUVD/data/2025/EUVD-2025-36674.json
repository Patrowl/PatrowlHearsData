Prior to 4.12.0, a buffer over-read occurs in w_expression_match() when strlen() is called on str_test, because the corresponding buffer is not being properly NULL terminated during its allocation in OS_CleanMSG(). A compromised agent can cause a READ operation beyond the end of the allocated buffer (which may contain sensitive information) by sending a specially crafted message to the wazuh manager. An attacker who is able to craft and send an agent message to the wazuh manager can cause a buffer over-read and potentially access sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.12.0.", "datePublished": "2025-10-29T16:50:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-29T18:10:35", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/security/advisories/GHSA-2672-vfhm-xhr6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62792"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7c9472cf-7db8-3dca-84e4-5e73786131a5", "product": {"name": "wazuh"}, "product_version": "< 4.12.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4349eaa3-5ee5-3557-93c6-bec6c1f7e6ef", "vendor": {"name": "wazuh"}}], "isExploited": false}
