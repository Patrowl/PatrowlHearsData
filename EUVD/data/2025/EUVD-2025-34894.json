In Squid versions prior to 7.2, a failure to redact HTTP authentication credentials in error handling allows information disclosure. The vulnerability allows a script to bypass browser security protections and learn the credentials a trusted client uses to authenticate. This potentially allows a remote client to identify security tokens or credentials used internally by a web application using Squid for backend load balancing. These attacks do not require Squid to be configured with HTTP authentication. The vulnerability is fixed in version 7.2. As a workaround, disable debug information in administrator mailto links generated by Squid by configuring squid.conf with email_err_data off.", "datePublished": "2025-10-17T16:21:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-05T17:04:22", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-phh7-xmxr", "https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/0951a0681011dfca3d78c84fd7f1e19c78a4443f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62168"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0832ba73-e4cb-338c-a30f-89a4f5325af8", "product": {"name": "squid"}, "product_version": "< 7.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f87dc4e7-dece-39ee-a61d-7b27597f1e49", "vendor": {"name": "squid-cache"}}], "isExploited": false}
