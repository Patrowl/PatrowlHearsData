Prior to version 1.26.2, it's possible to poison feed favicons by adding a given URL as a feed with the proxy set to an attacker-controlled one and disabled SSL verifying. The favicon hash is computed by hashing the feed URL and the salt, whilst not including the following variables: proxy address, proxy protocol, and whether SSL should be verified. Therefore it's possible to poison a favicon of a given feed by simply intercepting the response of the feed, and changing the website URL to one where a threat actor controls the feed favicon. Feed favicons can be replaced for all users by anyone. Version 1.26.2 fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-06-04T20:04:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-04T20:48:49", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8f79-3q3w-43c4", "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/3776e1e48f33e80eb4b674bb64b419caf3b5a4e2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46339"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ebac2ce7-4598-35de-9b31-5862528caf62", "product": {"name": "FreshRSS"}, "product_version": "< 1.26.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "53973750-45ee-3dcd-87a7-6f980cf90d34", "vendor": {"name": "FreshRSS"}}], "isExploited": false}
