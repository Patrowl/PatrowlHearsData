When reading a file with an indirect extent map, grub2 fails to validate the number of extent entries to be read. A crafted or corrupted BFS filesystem may cause an integer overflow during the file reading, leading to a heap of bounds read. As a consequence, sensitive data may be leaked, or grub2 will crash.", "datePublished": "2025-03-03T14:25:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T01:33:24", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45779", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45779", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2345854", "https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/grub-devel/2025-02/msg00024.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-45779", "GHSA-qg4m-5hg4-34vq"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5bddd59b-efd1-38fa-b98c-7fe2fbd39b02", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
