This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the \u2018/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities\u2019 endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to \u2018/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities\u2019. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted.", "datePublished": "2025-01-16T15:32:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-07T18:30:41", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/multiple-vulnerabilities-pmb-platform", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0473"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-0473"], "assigner": "INCIBE", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fdd4bccf-e70a-3ded-96ef-11fa4706bdc7", "product": {"name": "PMB platform"}, "product_version": "4.0.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "57aebd16-2520-35c2-a76f-b8ab34b2f3f0", "vendor": {"name": "PMB Services"}}], "isExploited": false}
