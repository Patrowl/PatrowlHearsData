In versions prior to 2.38.0, the system did stored the attachments uploaded by the students in their assignments as public files. This issue potentially exposed student-uploaded files to the public. Anyone with the file URL could access these files without authentication. The issue has been fixed in version 2.38.0 by ensuring all student-uploaded assignment attachments are stored as private files by default.", "datePublished": "2025-10-10T20:05:38", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-10T20:44:13", "baseScore": 2.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/frappe/lms/security/advisories/GHSA-h6fh-7f24-f2j5", "https://github.com/frappe/lms/commit/78640561f558a6c7396f8be48874f79a54f03420"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62158"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bfd37460-e59b-3991-a9e1-5775c9dae4f8", "product": {"name": "LMS"}, "product_version": "< 2.38.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bcf8621d-1bae-3fab-ac93-a7db4d052c69", "vendor": {"name": "frappe"}}], "isExploited": false}
