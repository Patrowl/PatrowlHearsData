The absence of encryption and authentication mechanisms in the communication protocol allows an attacker to capture legitimate traffic between the robot and the controller, replicate it, and send any valid command to the robot from any attacking computer or device. The communication protocol used in this interface is based on MAVLink, a widely documented protocol, which increases the likelihood of attack. There are two methods for connecting to the robot remotely: Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE.", "datePublished": "2025-10-22T09:30:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-31T21:30:58", "baseScore": 9.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-41108", "https://www.incibe.es/en/incibe-cert/notices/aviso/multiple-vulnerabilities-ghost-robotics-vision-60"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-41108", "GHSA-7923-5qwc-8v2q"], "assigner": "INCIBE", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e697dbd5-a630-3417-aed8-f3af0c83a582", "product": {"name": "Vision 60"}, "product_version": "0.27.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75cec139-e4c0-318e-b94a-5021c075b720", "vendor": {"name": "Ghost Robotics"}}], "isExploited": false}
