This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-10-09T05:23:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-09T16:03:12", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7526", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-travel-engine/tags/6.5.6/includes/dashboard/class-wp-travel-engine-form-handler.php#L512", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c754d957-26a8-4fef-a487-96d566c2dc36?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7526", "GHSA-2rp7-34mp-c625"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72df9c7d-911c-358d-936a-8f5923102a00", "product": {"name": "WP Travel Engine \u2013 Tour Booking Plugin \u2013 Tour Operator Software"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.6.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "190d3aed-283b-3bf7-a063-e638c381b2df", "vendor": {"name": "wptravelengine"}}], "isExploited": false}
