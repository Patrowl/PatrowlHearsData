This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords and email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account. This can be combined with CVE-2025-3609 to achieve remote code execution as an originally unauthenticated user with no account.", "datePublished": "2025-05-06T01:42:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T02:37:17", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3610", "https://themeforest.net/item/reales-wp-real-estate-wordpress-theme/10330568", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/38c6b149-39d7-491a-9f3a-261087a52a03?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3610", "GHSA-52cj-q87r-f28w"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ba1fbf8a-249a-3614-9483-958207b308d7", "product": {"name": "Reales WP STPT"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7dce3d38-3e07-361b-8924-74fde2004855", "vendor": {"name": "pixel_prime"}}], "isExploited": false}
