An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-01-08T16:19:28", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T20:36:51", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-xss-CDOJZyH", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xwork-xss-KCcg7WwU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20168"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "05c590e1-81cc-3da1-b92a-c07eb097e11b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11"}, {"id": "9d50554c-c3fe-3726-bfdd-60aa60a98334", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.2"}, {"id": "bb920684-cf7e-39a2-af3a-6fb010f2ba15", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.1"}, {"id": "eb3d020a-3717-3ab1-84ea-c283aa44d109", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a60d1c50-32e9-3d20-8540-92e4deee835c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
