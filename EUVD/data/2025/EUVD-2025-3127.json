It has an action=myprojects&logout=1 CSRF issue in the alert-title while performing an upload of a CSV file containing a list of alert configuration. An attacker can send the victim a CSV file containing an HTML injection payload in the alert-title. Once the victim uploads the file, he automatically lands on a page to view the uploaded data. If the victim click on the alert-title value, it can trigger a logout request and terminates their session, or redirect to a phishing website. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality.", "datePublished": "2025-01-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-13T20:35:35", "baseScore": 3.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/blob/main/RedCap/CVE_XXX/README.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-23113"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b010e17f-7b67-32d0-8496-6733da16c6d5", "product": {"name": "REDCap"}, "product_version": "14.9.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d7269e7e-c07e-37a0-bad2-e2392efc33ae", "vendor": {"name": "Vanderbilt"}}], "isExploited": false}
