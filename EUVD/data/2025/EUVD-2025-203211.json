This is due to the endpoint using `upload_files` capability check (Author level) for a destructive operation that can delete all folders. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to delete all folder organization data created by Administrators and other users.", "datePublished": "2025-12-13T04:31:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-15T15:47:21", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9102fe7e-7baa-4bc0-879f-cc7df1ea13d2?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mediacommander/trunk/includes/Rest/Controllers/FoldersController.php#L127", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/mediacommander/trunk/includes/Models/FoldersModel.php#L793", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3417928/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14508"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14508"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3cbf6272-ca87-3281-803a-006c2774181d", "product": {"name": "MediaCommander \u2013 Bring Folders to Media, Posts, and Pages"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6269fd82-b692-34e2-b5ff-ff8dcd5a04b9", "vendor": {"name": "yalogica"}}], "isExploited": false}
