This is due to insufficient path validation in the `simple_download_counter_parse_path()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which may contain sensitive information such as database credentials (wp-config.php) or system files. Please note that the vendor opted to continue to allow remote file downloads from arbitrary locations on the server, however, has disabled this functionality on multi-sites and provided a warning to site owners in the readme.txt when they install the plugin. While not an optimal patch, we have considered this sufficient and recommend users proceed to use the plugin with caution.", "datePublished": "2025-12-10T03:23:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-10T15:23:25", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b82a0f71-29d7-469a-8c69-5ab68d599cb9?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simple-download-counter/trunk/inc/functions-admin.php#L566", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/simple-download-counter/tags/2.2.2/inc/functions-admin.php#L566", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3409876%40simple-download-counter&new=3409876%40simple-download-counter&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13677"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13677"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eaa2e309-366d-3b73-aad7-37c5384950f9", "product": {"name": "Simple Download Counter"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "46155ea2-0422-3822-8fcf-f3f6689a026a", "vendor": {"name": "specialk"}}], "isExploited": false}
