Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption.\n\nThis issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`.", "datePublished": "2025-04-25T20:20:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-28T14:17:45", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/security/advisories/GHSA-mm4c-p35v-7hx3", "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/104", "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/105"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46333"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb7a3d25-c7d6-3040-963f-29b7c9f80b4a", "product": {"name": "z2d"}, "product_version": "= 0.6.0"}, {"id": "bc02f510-e346-303c-bbfd-880d86f80684", "product": {"name": "z2d"}, "product_version": "> 0.5.1, \u2264 0.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d438bde5-1f46-36bd-8ebe-ef831feecf6d", "vendor": {"name": "vancluever"}}], "isExploited": false}
