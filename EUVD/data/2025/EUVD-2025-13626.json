If those \nrewrite rules effectively enforced security constraints, those \nconstraints could be bypassed.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.5, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.39, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.102.\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100. Other, older, EOL versions \nmay also be affected.\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version [FIXED_VERSION], which fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-04-28T19:17:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T19:53:12", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31651", "https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/066bf6b6a15a4e7e0941d4acf096841165b97098", "https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/175dc75fc428930034a6c93fb52f830d955d8e64", "https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/ee3ab548e92345eca0cbd1f01649eb36c6f29454", "https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/fbecc915a10c5a3d634c5e2c6ced4ff479ce9953", "https://github.com/apache/tomcat", "https://lists.apache.org/list.html?announce@tomcat.apache.org", "https://tomcat.apache.org/security-10.html", "https://tomcat.apache.org/security-11.html", "https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/04/28/3", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/07/msg00009.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-31651", "GHSA-ff77-26x5-69cr"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "044f1c15-4e7d-3da7-ae86-7e17815fa5aa", "product": {"name": "Apache Tomcat"}, "product_version": ""}, {"id": "309151d6-d8e3-3a4f-b2f4-519518277fc2", "product": {"name": "Apache Tomcat"}, "product_version": "11.0.0-M1 \u226411.0.5"}, {"id": "69e1823d-cfea-37dd-b270-049cc2d0b204", "product": {"name": "Apache Tomcat"}, "product_version": "10.1.0-M1 \u226410.1.39"}, {"id": "8e72c52a-9116-3435-8cbb-d3aff3a00089", "product": {"name": "Apache Tomcat"}, "product_version": "8.5.0 \u22648.5.100"}, {"id": "e33e35f8-69af-366f-9b0a-f6cb6f7a0613", "product": {"name": "Apache Tomcat"}, "product_version": "9.0.0.M1 \u22649.0.102"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1264b264-8d39-3b4e-b104-3fbc3ad13343", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
