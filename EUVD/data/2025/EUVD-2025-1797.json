This could serve as a backdoor to the device, and could lead to a malicious actor being able to upload and overwrite files on the device.", "datePublished": "2025-01-30T18:17:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-01T17:12:24", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-030-01", "https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-certain-patient-monitors-contec-and-epsimed-fda-safety-communication"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-0626"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d2748758-c3d8-363b-af5a-b75570c518c8", "product": {"name": "CMS8000 Patient Monitor"}, "product_version": "All versions"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5f4d98ae-ec02-3674-b49d-a0be6b8cf21a", "vendor": {"name": "Contec Health"}}], "isExploited": false}
