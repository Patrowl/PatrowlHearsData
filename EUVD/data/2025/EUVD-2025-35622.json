This issue stems from the /etc/passwd file being created with group-writable permissions during build time. In certain conditions, an attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, can leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.", "datePublished": "2025-10-22T18:19:06", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-23T22:16:55", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17562", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-58712", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2394418", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58712"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58712"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fde1e6e-7ce4-3dd0-8cfb-01a7fac085bb", "product": {"name": "activemq-artemis"}, "product_version": ""}, {"id": "74ec829a-04e6-3fcf-807c-8abaf39d8bfe", "product": {"name": "RHEL-9 based Middleware Containers"}, "product_version": "patch: 7.13.2-1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0469856e-fb3c-3a24-a1ac-5e24a84c47e7", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}, {"id": "3aa22785-0a95-324c-9450-c9d5e62a1cfd", "vendor": {"name": "Apache"}}], "isExploited": false}
