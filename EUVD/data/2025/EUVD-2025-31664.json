Versions through abd including 0.1.30 have a vulnerability where the pr.yml GitHub Action interpolates in an unsafe manner untrusted input, specifically the github.event.pull_request.head.repo.clone_url and github.head_ref, to a command in the runner. Due to the action using the pull_request_target trigger it has permissive permissions by default. An unauthorized attacker can exploit this vulnerability to push arbitrary data to the repository. The subsequent impact on the end-user is executing the attackers' code when running serverless-dns. This is fixed in commit c5537dd, and expected to be released in 0.1.31.", "datePublished": "2025-09-30T00:12:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-30T13:33:56", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/security/advisories/GHSA-9g7x-737f-5xpc", "https://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns/commit/c5537dd7f203c59f2b86d1e295c2371f3533946a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61584"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1e065327-9b46-3b2c-beac-4e9caa26b1c4", "product": {"name": "serverless-dns"}, "product_version": "< 0.1.31"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b70851e-e6d0-343e-bf10-ec61e3e7f5ca", "vendor": {"name": "serverless-dns"}}], "isExploited": false}
