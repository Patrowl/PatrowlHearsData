The Zed IDE loads Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations from the `settings.json` file located within a project\u2019s `.zed` subdirectory. A malicious MCP configuration can contain arbitrary shell commands that run on the host system with the privileges of the user running the IDE. This can be triggered automatically without any user interaction besides opening the project in the IDE. Version 0.218.2-pre fixes the issue by implementing worktree trust mechanism. As a workaround, users should carefully review the contents of project settings files (`./zed/settings.json`) before opening new projects in Zed.", "datePublished": "2025-12-17T22:47:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-18T15:34:00", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/security/advisories/GHSA-cv6g-cmxc-vw8j", "https://zed.dev/blog/secure-by-default"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-68433"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb6c4c05-443d-3455-a1f5-399dc1ffcd20", "product": {"name": "zed"}, "product_version": "< 0.218.2-pre"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a6e12f5f-04a0-329b-bf9b-8d4273056ae1", "vendor": {"name": "zed-industries"}}], "isExploited": false}
