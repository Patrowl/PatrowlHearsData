This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). If WooCommerce is enabled, attackers will need Contributor-level access and above.", "datePublished": "2025-07-03T12:23:09", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-03T13:14:49", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/68679ff9-48a8-4146-a37f-5f844dc86c92?source=cve", "http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/jkdevkit/inc/modules/fonts_manager.php#L1710"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-2932"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9964ce8b-93a6-33b0-b331-dd64259b0230", "product": {"name": "JKDEVKIT"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.9.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cf6153ea-fe1c-3004-9c0a-08e7326e32e2", "vendor": {"name": "jkdevstudio"}}], "isExploited": false}
