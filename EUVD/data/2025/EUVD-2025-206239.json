In Coolify versions up to and including v4.0.0-beta.434, a low privileged user (member) can invite a high privileged user. At first, the application will throw an error, but if the attacker clicks the invite button a second time, it actually works. This way, a low privileged user can invite themselves as an administrator to the Coolify instance. After the high privileged user is invited, the attacker can initiate a password reset and log in with the new admin. As of time of publication, it is unclear if a patch is available.", "datePublished": "2026-01-05T19:42:46", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-05T20:06:08", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/security/advisories/GHSA-4p6r-m39m-9cm9", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YZHFgiZv_k9p9909A63DAErsTsh8K1rc/view?usp=drive_link"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-64421"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8c3cd4ec-e9a4-391f-aeea-b5db3777b6e9", "product": {"name": "coolify"}, "product_version": "\u2264 4.0.0-beta.434"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4bd7b6f6-b710-3624-a945-7905983cb656", "vendor": {"name": "coollabsio"}}], "isExploited": false}
