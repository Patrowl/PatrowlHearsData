Versions 1.6 and below are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks through Visual Studio Code Workspaces. Workspaces allow users to open more than a single folder and save specific settings (pretty similar to .vscode/settings.json) for the folders / project. An untitled workspace is automatically created by VS Code (untitled.code-workspace), which contains all the folders and workspace settings from the user's current session, opening up an entire new attack vector if the user has a .code-workspace file in path (either untitled created automatically or a saved one). If an attacker is able to hijack the chat context of the victim (such as via a compromised MCP server), they can use prompt injection to make the Cursor Agent write into this file and modify the workspace. This leads to a bypass of CVE-2025-54130 which can lead to RCE by writing to the settings section. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.", "datePublished": "2025-10-03T16:27:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-03T18:27:52", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-xg6w-rmh5-r77r"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61590"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c46c94ae-e238-3477-ad68-8ebc8fc7dde6", "product": {"name": "cursor"}, "product_version": "< 1.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3db8e31e-780d-3b5e-af9f-15d16d96e7c0", "vendor": {"name": "cursor"}}], "isExploited": false}
