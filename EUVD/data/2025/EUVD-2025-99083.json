More specifically, the parsing of user provided XML files was performed before the ACL checks. A malicious user with limited permissions could exploit this flaw by submitting a specially crafted XML file, causing libvirt to allocate too much memory on the host. The excessive memory consumption could lead to a libvirt process crash on the host, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T19:49:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T17:39:20", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12748", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-12748", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2413801"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12748", "GHSA-qwrw-p888-cc55"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ab8da9f-5ba7-3fa3-a034-397deaa3798e", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
