This is due to the bbackup_ajax_handle() function not having a capability check, nor validating user supplied input passed directly to call_user_func(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server which can be leverage to inject backdoors or create new administrative user accounts to name a few things. On WordPress sites running the Alone theme versions 7.8.4 and older, this can be chained with CVE-2025-5394 to install the Bears Backup plugin and achieve the same impact.", "datePublished": "2025-07-17T01:44:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-17T14:38:22", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/81b44abb-6d30-4930-b68b-9a04d93f5169?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/alone-charity-multipurpose-nonprofit-wordpress-theme/15019939"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5396"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8c61cad6-3b3a-315a-b6f3-5554d9127f25", "product": {"name": "Bears Backup"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f241ae58-0601-399c-b93e-34f7865388b4", "vendor": {"name": "Bearsthemes"}}], "isExploited": false}
