This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the bbp_user_add_role_on_register() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to elevate their privileges to that of a bbPress Keymaster via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Rather than implementing a nonce check to provide protection against this vulnerability, which would break functionality, the plugin no longer makes it possible to select a role during registration.", "datePublished": "2025-03-05T08:21:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-05T14:26:56", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2d776d94-8c81-4e88-bae3-946824a75c09?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/bbpress/trunk/includes/users/signups.php#L151", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3247345%40bbpress&new=3247345%40bbpress&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3247345/bbpress/branches/2.6/includes/users/capabilities.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1435"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-1435"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a2cb826-150a-3fa4-b3fa-6fe1d0fda870", "product": {"name": "bbPress"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.6.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e8240c4-2c8f-325b-a637-8044237e17d8", "vendor": {"name": "johnjamesjacoby"}}], "isExploited": false}
