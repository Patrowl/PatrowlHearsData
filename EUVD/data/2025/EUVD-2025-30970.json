An authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Horilla 1.3.0 due to the unsafe use of Python\u2019s eval() function on a user-controlled query parameter in the project_bulk_archive view. This allows privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute arbitrary system commands on the server. While having Django\u2019s DEBUG=True makes exploitation visibly easier by returning command output in the HTTP response, this is not required. The vulnerability can still be exploited in DEBUG=False mode by using blind payloads such as a reverse shell, leading to full remote code execution. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1.", "datePublished": "2025-09-24T13:51:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-24T18:45:55", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/security/advisories/GHSA-h6qj-pwmx-wjhw", "https://github.com/horilla-opensource/horilla/commit/b0aab62b3a5fe6b7114b5c58db129b3744b4d8cc", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XQAJilt77QxkjGEa94CsZRqZIZXa3ET9/view?usp=sharing", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hnI9AK3fnpVrTlTRF7aRJsKhZCDIm2Ve/view?usp=sharing"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48868"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.64, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f9646389-7de7-36fb-b6ca-91d17fbd036e", "product": {"name": "horilla"}, "product_version": "= 1.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ae84d529-bfae-36ac-af20-819f23e5c8fa", "vendor": {"name": "horilla-opensource"}}], "isExploited": false}
