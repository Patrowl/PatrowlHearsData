Continued use of this outdated cryptographic library exposes deployments to known vulnerabilities that are no longer patched, weakening the overall security posture. Affected daemons may emit deprecation warnings and rely on cryptographic components with unresolved security flaws, potentially enabling attackers to exploit weaknesses in TLS/SSL processing or cryptographic operations.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2023-021 \u2014 Out-of-Date OpenSSL Library.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T18:39:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T23:56:31", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34192", "https://help.printerlogic.com/saas/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://help.printerlogic.com/va/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2025-04-08-vasion-printerlogic-83-vulnerabilities.html#mac-outdated-openssl", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/vasion-print-printerlogic-usage-of-outdated-and-unsupported-openssl-version"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34192", "GHSA-c878-94h7-33g3"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4b1d5d19-4541-36a8-85f7-0eb71f5e6674", "product": {"name": "Print Application"}, "product_version": "* <20.0.2140"}, {"id": "778fe99e-ec2f-3953-b5a5-cf71825a0578", "product": {"name": "Print Virtual Appliance Host"}, "product_version": "* <22.0.893"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7c29953b-0d52-347b-b87f-c318984ac749", "vendor": {"name": "Vasion"}}], "isExploited": false}
