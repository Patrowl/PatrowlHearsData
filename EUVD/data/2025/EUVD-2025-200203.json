This is due to missing nonce verification on the bulk action functionality in the 'process_bulk_action()' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform bulk operations (delete, publish, or unpublish galleries) via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2025-12-02T06:40:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-02T14:15:44", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/42a14820-710d-4149-9a8d-aa84479f0980?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gallery-photo-gallery/trunk/includes/lists/class-gallery-photo-gallery-list-table.php#L1060", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/gallery-photo-gallery/tags/6.4.7/includes/lists/class-gallery-photo-gallery-list-table.php#L1060", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3404625/gallery-photo-gallery/tags/6.4.9/includes/lists/class-gallery-photo-gallery-list-table.php?old=3402336&old_path=gallery-photo-gallery%2Ftags%2F6.4.8%2Fincludes%2Flists%2Fclass-gallery-photo-gallery-list-table.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13685"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13685"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0f3c4d22-6c75-3bf0-9239-f88f31ff9775", "product": {"name": "Photo Gallery by Ays \u2013 Responsive Image Gallery"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c28f08c6-8cd3-3d4d-ac45-2fd6bbd649c4", "vendor": {"name": "ays-pro"}}], "isExploited": false}
