A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Attributes extension of the league/commonmark library (versions 1.5.0 through 2.6.x) allows remote attackers to insert malicious JavaScript calls into HTML. The league/commonmark library provides configuration options such as `html_input: 'strip'` and `allow_unsafe_links: false` to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by stripping raw HTML and disallowing unsafe links. However, when the Attributes Extension is enabled, it introduces a way for users to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into elements via Markdown syntax using curly braces. Version 2.7.0 contains three changes to prevent this XSS attack vector: All attributes starting with `on` are considered unsafe and blocked by default; support for an explicit allowlist of allowed HTML attributes; and manually-added `href` and `src` attributes now respect the existing `allow_unsafe_links` configuration option. If upgrading is not feasible, please consider disabling the `AttributesExtension` for untrusted users and/or filtering the rendered HTML through a library like HTMLPurifier.", "datePublished": "2025-05-05T19:52:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T13:47:03", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/security/advisories/GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46734", "https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/commit/f0d626cf05ad3e99e6db26ebcb9091b6cd1cd89b", "https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46734", "GHSA-3527-qv2q-pfvx"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "87c34e21-cbca-3382-b849-2854a676b460", "product": {"name": "commonmark"}, "product_version": "< 2.7.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "04c9c2e9-4c95-3a39-b9e0-7bb5777029a8", "vendor": {"name": "thephpleague"}}], "isExploited": false}
