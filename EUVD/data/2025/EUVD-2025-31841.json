This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access or higher, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database. An unauthenticated attacker could utilize an injected Cross-Site Scripting via user-agent on form submission to leverage this to achieve Reflected Cross-Site Scripting.", "datePublished": "2025-10-08T04:23:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-08T15:42:48", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11204", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager/trunk/services/class_rm_reports_service.php?rev=3360241", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3374106/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager/trunk?contextall=1&old=3366909&old_path=%2Fcustom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager%2Ftrunk", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4532cb38-453b-460c-879d-6f0e1caacafc?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-registration-form-builder-with-submission-manager/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11204", "GHSA-w493-fwv7-vhp9"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "efa53faf-8c7c-3ab5-b3fc-ad4e96badc7b", "product": {"name": "RegistrationMagic \u2013 Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.0.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be78f11f-1831-39ca-af50-3ae7457e05b5", "vendor": {"name": "Metagauss"}}], "isExploited": false}
