{"id": "EUVD-2025-18668", "enisaUuid": "8d1c3fc7-655a-3f13-9fe7-efcee6ce93d0", "description": "The Versa Director SD-WAN orchestration platform provides an option to upload various types of files. The Versa Director does not correctly limit file upload permissions. The UI appears not to allow file uploads but uploads still succeed. In addition, the Versa Director discloses the full filename of uploaded temporary files, including the UUID prefix. Insecure UCPE image upload in Versa Director allows an authenticated attacker to upload a webshell. \r\n\r\nExploitation Status: \r\n\r\nVersa Networks is not aware of any reported instance where this vulnerability was exploited. Proof of concept for this vulnerability has been disclosed by third party security researchers.  \r\n\r\nWorkarounds or Mitigation: \r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds to disable the GUI option. Versa recommends that Director be upgraded to one of the remediated software versions.", "datePublished": "2025-06-18T23:30:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-18T23:30:53", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://security-portal.versa-networks.com/emailbulletins/68526dbbdc94d6b9f2faf71a", "https://support.versa-networks.com/support/solutions/articles/23000026708-release-22-1-4", "https://support.versa-networks.com/support/solutions/articles/23000026033-release-22-1-3", "https://support.versa-networks.com/support/solutions/articles/23000025680-release-22-1-2", "https://support.versa-networks.com/support/solutions/articles/23000024323-release-21-2-3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-23171"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2b36b69b-982c-37c5-9383-3b0ba4e030b2", "product": {"name": "Director"}, "product_version": "22.1.4 \u226422.1.4"}, {"id": "5a46155c-05f9-3890-9bd0-c1bd971d922c", "product": {"name": "Director"}, "product_version": "22.1.3 \u226422.1.3"}, {"id": "7db9c6f4-4179-3120-8d13-1b6d1b2f96f7", "product": {"name": "Director"}, "product_version": "21.2.2 \u226421.2.2"}, {"id": "a2a79ea3-bb73-3e69-a4fe-0130d620028c", "product": {"name": "Director"}, "product_version": "22.1.1 \u226422.1.1"}, {"id": "d6836a26-c503-3e30-a7ef-3e33dc98faa8", "product": {"name": "Director"}, "product_version": "21.2.3 \u226421.2.3"}, {"id": "fba83a9b-0adb-3b2a-8b2f-63c9ae42d33d", "product": {"name": "Director"}, "product_version": "22.1.2 \u226422.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ee7e30df-46fd-3b0c-89d1-af76cf19add4", "vendor": {"name": "Versa"}}], "isExploited": false}
