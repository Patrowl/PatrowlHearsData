If an attacker is able to compromise the Logstash process - for example by exploiting an insecure plugin, pipeline configuration injection, or a vulnerability in input parsing - the attacker could execute code with root privileges, resulting in full system compromise. The Logstash service has been altered to run as the lower-privileged 'nagios' user to reduce this risk associated with a network-facing service that can accept untrusted input or load third-party components.", "datePublished": "2025-10-30T21:23:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T21:36:25", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.nagios.com/products/security/#log-server-2024R2", "https://www.nagios.com/changelog/#log-server", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/nagios-log-server-logstash-process-root-privileges", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34274"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34274"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "23ff2748-d668-38ed-8617-0f24cf18937e", "product": {"name": "Log Server"}, "product_version": "0 <2024R2.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af876159-3c30-32bb-8377-b0d7b9411b71", "vendor": {"name": "Nagios"}}], "isExploited": false}
