In version 2.1.4 and prior, an insecure view count mechanism in the forum page allows an unauthenticated attacker to artificially increase the view count. The application relies on a client-side cookie (nl-topic-[tid]) (or session variable for guests) to determine if a view should be counted. When a client does not provide the cookie, every page request increments the counter, leading to incorrect view metrics.
