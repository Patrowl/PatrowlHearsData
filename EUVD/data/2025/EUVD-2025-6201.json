However, the directories to which a user has access are not limited, allowing for path traversal attacks and downloading sensitive information.\nThe vendor has not replied to reports, so the patching status remains unknown. Newer firmware versions might be vulnerable as well.", "datePublished": "2025-03-06T14:03:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-06T14:46:41", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13894", "https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/03/CVE-2024-13892", "https://www.smartwares.eu/en-gb/smartwares-cip-37210at-indoor-wi-fi-camera-cip--37210at", "https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/03/CVE-2024-13892/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13894", "GHSA-vw7g-g3g7-v6rm"], "assigner": "CERT-PL", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "685de826-693e-3151-9184-33aa5f0ec349", "product": {"name": "C724IP"}, "product_version": "0 \u22643.3.0"}, {"id": "cb387890-86bc-37f4-80ca-f5001999fe9b", "product": {"name": "CIP-37210AT"}, "product_version": "0 \u22643.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "88373efa-fd17-3b22-b648-0e3de8e3e543", "vendor": {"name": "Smartwares"}}], "isExploited": false}
