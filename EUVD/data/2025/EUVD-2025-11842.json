In versions 5.0.0 to 5.3.0 as well as version 4.29.0, applications that specify different validation strategies for different content types have a possibility to bypass validation by providing a _slightly altered_ content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`. This was patched in v5.3.1, but the initial patch did not cover all problems. This has been fully patched in v5.3.2 and v4.29.1. A workaround involves not specifying individual content types in the schema.", "datePublished": "2025-04-18T15:59:06", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-22T20:50:43", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-mg2h-6x62-wpwc", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/436da4c06dfbbb8c24adee3a64de0c51e4f47418", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify", "https://hackerone.com/reports/3087928", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32442", "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/f3d2bcb3963cd570a582e5d39aab01a9ae692fe4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32442", "GHSA-mg2h-6x62-wpwc"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "62c05531-a5c1-31e0-a268-19a5dc3419f8", "product": {"name": "fastify"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.3.1"}, {"id": "7f97fd40-5a34-34c4-a14d-7475e89e881e", "product": {"name": "fastify"}, "product_version": "= 4.29.0"}, {"id": "8cab17d8-da92-3b13-b588-bc4372bdb6cb", "product": {"name": "fastify"}, "product_version": "5.0.0, < 5.3.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eeb91313-2a7c-329d-88c5-58bbaee53152", "vendor": {"name": "fastify"}}], "isExploited": false}
