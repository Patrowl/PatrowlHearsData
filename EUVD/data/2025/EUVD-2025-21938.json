{"id": "EUVD-2025-21938", "enisaUuid": "66045645-3498-35c2-b10f-6eba08091d1f", "description": "In the OpenSSL compatibility layer implementation, the function RAND_poll() was not behaving as expected and leading to the potential for predictable values returned from RAND_bytes() after fork() is called. This can lead to weak or predictable random numbers generated in applications that are both using RAND_bytes() and doing fork() operations. This only affects applications explicitly calling RAND_bytes() after fork() and does not affect any internal TLS operations. Although RAND_bytes() documentation in OpenSSL calls out not being safe for use with fork() without first calling RAND_poll(), an additional code change was also made in wolfSSL to make RAND_bytes() behave similar to OpenSSL after a fork() call without calling RAND_poll(). Now the Hash-DRBG used gets reseeded after detecting running in a new process. If making use of RAND_bytes() and calling fork() we recommend updating to the latest version of wolfSSL. Thanks to Per Allansson from Appgate for the report.", "datePublished": "2025-07-19T00:32:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-03T15:30:27", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#wolfssl-release-582-july-17-2025", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7394"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7394"], "assigner": "wolfSSL", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "734d9c1f-6a47-3dde-8fae-2d2eb8b5ff91", "product": {"name": "wolfSSL"}, "product_version": "3.15.0 \u22645.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bb492120-0955-3355-8df5-d018f91bf13f", "vendor": {"name": "wolfSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
