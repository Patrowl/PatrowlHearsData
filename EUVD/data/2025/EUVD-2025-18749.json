The BLE implementation of the COROS smartwatch does not support LE Secure Connections and instead enforces BLE Legacy Pairing. In BLE Legacy Pairing, the Short-Term Key (STK) can be easily guessed. This requires knowledge of the Temporary Key (TK), which, in the case of the COROS Pace 3, is set to 0 due to the Just Works pairing method. An attacker within Bluetooth range can therefore perform sniffing attacks, allowing eavesdropping on the communication.", "datePublished": "2025-06-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-24T14:37:18", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://syss.de", "https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/20087694119828-COROS-PACE-3-Release-Notes", "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2025-023.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32876"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "54db163e-6246-3625-b09b-0c45e8487bfe", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "583e44b4-0f5d-31aa-8cb4-94c210c3f813", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
