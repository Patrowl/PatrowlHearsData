A vulnerability present in versions 0.10.0 through 1.0.2 allows to set up a template that allows to embed arbitrary Javascript. This enables the attacker to act on behalf of the user, if the template is being previewed; and act on behalf of the headless browser, if a report using the template is printed to PDF. This issue has been resolved in version 1.0.3 of Icinga Reporting. As a workaround, review all templates and remove suspicious settings.", "datePublished": "2025-03-26T15:49:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-26T16:15:22", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/security/advisories/GHSA-7qvq-54vm-r7hx", "https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2-module-reporting/releases/tag/v1.0.3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27406"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82a408e2-be53-3be5-92bb-20c5f081d3df", "product": {"name": "icingaweb2-module-reporting"}, "product_version": "0.10.0, < 1.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ddf0e2b8-f60b-3552-8d60-bc574ba1ddc1", "vendor": {"name": "Icinga"}}], "isExploited": false}
