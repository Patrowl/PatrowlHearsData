By leaving JTAG enabled on an ESP32 in a commercial product an attacker with physical access to the device can connect over this port and reflash the device's firmware with malicious code which will be executed upon running. As a result, the victim will lose access to the functionality of their device and the attack may gain unauthorized access to the victim's Wi-Fi network by re-connecting to the SSID defined in the NVS partition of the device.", "datePublished": "2025-12-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-11T20:35:56", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/dead1nfluence/Meatmeet-Pro-Vulnerabilities/blob/main/Device/JTAG-Enabled.md", "https://gist.github.com/dead1nfluence/4dffc239b4a460f41a03345fd8e5feb5#file-jtag-enabled-md", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65822"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65822"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8b40c26e-c969-3d1a-90da-68bca8c7ec69", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dd7a3e1c-90d3-3223-8a94-554beb7ca6f1", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
