This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the fl_forgot_pass_new() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-03-01T06:39:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-03T20:57:20", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13373", "https://themeforest.net/item/exertio-freelance-marketplace-wordpress-theme/30602587", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/897ce9a9-8b3e-40bc-9815-c55cc7a838f9?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-13373", "GHSA-68rv-4j98-w7cq"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5039be8-cf8b-3f05-8cfc-a8f12fe7a847", "product": {"name": "Exertio Framework"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "22b25520-1a0f-335d-a244-5ed51de06f8d", "vendor": {"name": "scriptsbundle"}}], "isExploited": false}
