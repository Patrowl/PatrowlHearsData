A crash of the DD+ decoder process can occur when a malformed DD+ bitstream is processed. When Evolution data is processed by evo_priv.c from the DD+ bitstream, the decoder writes that data into a buffer. The length calculation for a write can overflow due to an integer wraparound. This can lead to the allocated buffer being too small, and the out-of-bounds check of the subsequent write to be ineffective, leading to an out-of-bounds write.", "datePublished": "2025-10-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-20T18:05:36", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54957", "https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/pdfs/dolby-security-advisory-CVE-2025-54957-Oct-14-25.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54957", "GHSA-rj4r-gj6w-jfgc"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "683a5118-e210-3dba-bb12-8aaafdcb253d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bedb2b04-4394-3f33-b568-a37ffe945420", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
