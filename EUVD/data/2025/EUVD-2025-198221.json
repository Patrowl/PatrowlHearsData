Prior to version 4.5.4, an insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability allows any authenticated user to delete arbitrary participants from polls without ownership verification. The endpoint relies solely on a participant ID to authorize deletions, enabling attackers to remove other users (including poll owners) from polls. This impacts the integrity and availability of poll participation data.
