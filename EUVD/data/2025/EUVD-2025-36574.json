The weakness arises due to insufficient validation of user input in plugin endpoints, allowing crafted input to influence backend queries in unexpected ways. Using specially crafted payloads, this can escalate into unsafe deserialization, enabling arbitrary object injection in PHP. Although the issue is remotely exploitable without authentication, it does require a crafted interaction with the affected endpoint in order to trigger successfully.", "datePublished": "2025-10-28T23:54:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-29T14:48:16", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4665", "https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blob/master/2025/MNDT-2025-0006.md", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-cfdb7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-4665", "GHSA-mj35-jrmp-p9jm"], "assigner": "Mandiant", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "063a07bb-09a5-33d3-922a-dd0289994793", "product": {"name": "CFDB7"}, "product_version": "0.0.0 \u22641.3.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dddcce59-9b3b-3c6e-8c06-948956484904", "vendor": {"name": "WordPress Contact Form 7 Database Addon CFDB7 By Arshid"}}], "isExploited": false}
