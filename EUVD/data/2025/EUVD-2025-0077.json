When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and is patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no workarounds known at this time.", "datePublished": "2025-01-14T19:33:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-28T04:55:24", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/security/advisories/GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53263", "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/commit/0345b6f816e611d050c0df67b61f0022916a1c90", "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs", "https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v3.6.1", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/01/msg00022.html", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3390"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-53263", "GHSA-q6r2-x2cc-vrp7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0bdb65b1-d8cc-367b-873b-1f01b3237730", "product": {"name": "git-lfs"}, "product_version": "0.1.0, < 3.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f21b29b2-85cb-30c2-a812-f410459720d8", "vendor": {"name": "git-lfs"}}], "isExploited": false}
