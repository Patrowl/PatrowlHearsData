NOTE: the Supplier's position is that authentication is not mandatory for MCP servers, and the mcp-neo4j MCP server is only intended for use in a local environment where authentication realistically would not be needed. Also, the Supplier provides middleware to help isolate the MCP server from external access (if needed).", "datePublished": "2025-09-10T15:31:18", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-16T15:32:27", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/issues/124", "https://github.com/August829/CVEP/issues/1", "https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-56406"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-56406"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6ee5ffb6-f2a4-3a2b-b680-93f2db7b9031", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8eb3e929-452f-3777-a126-e693f7299d5b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
