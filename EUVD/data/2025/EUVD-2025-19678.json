This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-07-02T03:47:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-02T13:15:00", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/afd4f2ca-9c27-4de0-ac82-3cd107b6a092?source=cve", "http://localhost:1337/wp-content/themes/homevillas-real-estate/include/backend/cs-widgets/import/cs-class-widget-data.php#L384"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5014"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8157009-a0df-3f05-8a9a-b1e8470d6542", "product": {"name": "Home Villas | Real Estate WordPress Theme"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa383798-44e9-3a15-89c4-1b07013a53fd", "vendor": {"name": "Chimp Group"}}], "isExploited": false}
