OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions: First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; third, those contextual tuples\u2019s user field is an userset; and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible.", "datePublished": "2025-05-22T22:20:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-23T14:14:20", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-c72g-53hw-82q7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48371", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/e5960d4eba92b723de8ff3a5346a07f50c1379ca", "https://github.com/openfga/openfga", "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3707"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48371", "GHSA-c72g-53hw-82q7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ca29642-cd2d-3aa8-b4c1-3072e7cf659b", "product": {"name": "openfga"}, "product_version": "1.8.0, < 1.8.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "10fd2c84-e320-3b4e-a05c-903390dbc428", "vendor": {"name": "openfga"}}], "isExploited": false}
