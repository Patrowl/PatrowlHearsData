In versions 1.1.0 through 2.41.0, email verification was not enforced when using Basic HTTP Authentication. As a result, users could create accounts using fake email addresses and use the product as verified users. Additionally, the missing email verification check leaves the system open to bot signups and further usage. CVAT 2.42.0 and later versions contain a fix for the issue. CVAT Enterprise customers have a workaround available; those customers may disable registration to prevent this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-07-30T14:32:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-30T14:45:10", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/security/advisories/GHSA-fxgh-m76j-242q", "https://github.com/cvat-ai/cvat/commit/bc20eff16b8406fbb755f6540e6f269da0c9c5b2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54573"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee18c4b8-ec24-355c-a52f-9bf60ecd37e1", "product": {"name": "cvat"}, "product_version": "1.1.0, < 2.42.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "627f75c0-d258-3a2b-93f4-3239e3f5e40e", "vendor": {"name": "cvat-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
