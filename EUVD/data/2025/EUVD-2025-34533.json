This is due to insufficient restriction of allowed HTML tags and improper sanitization of user-supplied attributes in the font_container parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level access or higher to inject arbitrary web scripts in posts that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page via the vc_custom_heading shortcode with malicious tag and text attributes granted they have access to use WPBakery shortcodes.", "datePublished": "2025-10-15T06:43:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T16:13:10", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2772cade-c625-437a-b57b-ce8a2e3393bf?source=cve", "http://kb.wpbakery.com/docs/preface/release-notes/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11161"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11161"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "455f0423-03d3-3002-933d-27468ca5f4fd", "product": {"name": "WPBakery Page Builder"}, "product_version": "* \u22648.6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "678934ec-a97f-38b0-8653-8645295d618f", "vendor": {"name": "WPBakery"}}], "isExploited": false}
