Prior to version 0.3.5, in the Mermaid chart rendering component, there is a risky operation of directly using `innerHTML` to set user content. Therefore, any malicious content rendered via Mermaid will directly trigger the exploit chain, leading to command execution. This vulnerability is primarily caused by a failure to fully address the existing XSS issue in the project, leading to another exploit chain. The exploit chain is consistent with the report GHSA-hqr4-4gfc-5p2j, executing arbitrary JavaScript code via XSS and arbitrary commands via exposed IPC. Version 0.3.5 contains an updated fix.", "datePublished": "2025-09-09T20:19:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-09T20:31:54", "baseScore": 9.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ThinkInAIXYZ/deepchat/security/advisories/GHSA-f7q5-vc93-wp6j"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58768"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "83a8acef-ecf7-3ada-9cb4-32b5b0b19029", "product": {"name": "deepchat"}, "product_version": "< 0.3.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "848c9f87-5a48-3bdc-9bf2-dd1ea491f9d2", "vendor": {"name": "ThinkInAIXYZ"}}], "isExploited": false}
