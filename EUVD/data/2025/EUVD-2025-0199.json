{"id": "EUVD-2025-0199", "enisaUuid": "428318db-74ff-3ab5-ba8d-098eda04af61", "description": "YesWiki is a wiki system written in PHP. In versions up to and including 4.4.5, it is possible for an authenticated user with rights to edit/create a page or comment to trigger a stored XSS which will be reflected on any page where the resource is loaded. The vulnerability makes use of the content edition feature and more specifically of the `{{attach}}` component allowing users to attach files/medias to a page. When a file is attached using the `{{attach}}` component, if the resource contained in the `file` attribute doesn't exist, then the server will generate a file upload button containing the filename. This vulnerability allows any malicious authenticated user that has the right to create a comment or edit a page to be able to steal accounts and therefore modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-01-21T17:02:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-21T17:15:37", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24018", "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b", "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki", "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/blob/v4.4.5/tools/attach/libs/attach.lib.php#L660"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24018", "GHSA-w59h-3x3q-3p6j"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bedddda7-987d-39dd-89bd-a060bd64eb17", "product": {"name": "yeswiki"}, "product_version": "< 4.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "092d2434-3f1a-3dab-ac5c-69d516287e64", "vendor": {"name": "YesWiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
