An unauthenticated file upload endpoint can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands by uploading a CGI-based webshell. Once a file is uploaded, the attacker can execute commands with root privileges, gaining full control over the dashcam. Additionally, by uploading a netcat (nc) binary, the attacker can establish a reverse shell, maintaining persistent remote and privileged access to the device. This allows complete device takeover.", "datePublished": "2025-06-26T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-26T20:24:08", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.iroadau.com.au/downloads/", "https://github.com/geo-chen/IROAD?tab=readme-ov-file#finding-11---cve-2025-30131-unrestricted-webshell"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-30131"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "60ccb17b-76ed-3e63-9fe5-5ed59259b5dd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a14993e0-d64f-30ca-b7a4-fa35ced2a984", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
