Prior to version 1.2.46, Kanboard allows password reset emails to be sent with URLs derived from the unvalidated Host header when the application_url configuration is unset (default behavior). This allows an attacker to craft a malicious password reset link that leaks the token to an attacker-controlled domain. If a victim (including an administrator) clicks the poisoned link, their account can be taken over. This affects all users who initiate a password reset while application_url is not set. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.46.", "datePublished": "2025-06-24T02:56:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-24T02:56:26", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/security/advisories/GHSA-2ch5-gqjm-8p92", "https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/bca2bd7ab95e7990e358fd35a7daf51a9c16aa75"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-52560"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "82269460-b0bc-35c7-903c-87b05ad488e7", "product": {"name": "kanboard"}, "product_version": "< 1.2.46"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5225ec4b-b34e-3a3e-9740-37f05aaaec64", "vendor": {"name": "kanboard"}}], "isExploited": false}
