The same private host keys (RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519) are present across installations, rather than being uniquely generated per appliance. An attacker who obtains these private keys (for example from one compromised appliance image or another installation) can impersonate the appliance, decrypt or intercept SSH connections to appliances that use the same keys, and perform man-in-the-middle or impersonation attacks against administrative SSH sessions.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-011 \u2014 Hardcoded SSH Host Key.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T18:40:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T23:56:32", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34198", "https://help.printerlogic.com/saas/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://help.printerlogic.com/va/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2025-04-08-vasion-printerlogic-83-vulnerabilities.html#va-hardcoded-ssh-keys", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/vasion-print-printerlogic-shared-hardcoded-ssh-host-private-keys-in-appliance-image"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34198", "GHSA-3x39-7gwg-8x8p"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "908f7533-ef20-3278-bd9d-0dc5a8d7cabf", "product": {"name": "Print Application"}, "product_version": "* <20.0.2368"}, {"id": "fb775028-4adf-3888-9483-d72ebd72b9d3", "product": {"name": "Print Virtual Appliance Host"}, "product_version": "* <22.0.951"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bf082059-3ba5-3a57-bf01-f8bdd23542e0", "vendor": {"name": "Vasion"}}], "isExploited": false}
