{"id": "EUVD-2025-4771", "enisaUuid": "79f7cea0-95dd-3c54-bad7-66c74639dec2", "description": "Home Assistant Core is an open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Affected versions are subject to a potential man-in-the-middle attacks due to missing SSL certificate verification in the project codebase and used third-party libraries. In the past, `aiohttp-session`/`request` had the parameter `verify_ssl` to control SSL certificate verification. This was a boolean value. In `aiohttp` 3.0, this parameter was deprecated in favor of the `ssl` parameter. Only when `ssl` is set to `None` or provided with a correct configured SSL context the standard SSL certificate verification will happen. When migrating integrations in Home Assistant and libraries used by Home Assistant, in some cases the `verify_ssl` parameter value was just moved to the new `ssl` parameter. This resulted in these integrations and 3rd party libraries using `request.ssl = True`, which unintentionally turned off SSL certificate verification and opened up a man-in-the-middle attack vector. This issue has been addressed in version 2024.1.6 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T18:53:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-18T19:23:41", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/home-assistant/core/security/advisories/GHSA-m3pm-rpgg-5wj6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25305", "https://github.com/home-assistant/core/commit/8c6547f1b64f4a3d9f10090b97383353c9367892", "https://github.com/home-assistant/core"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-25305", "GHSA-m3pm-rpgg-5wj6"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "51ac5c2b-e4ca-36ff-8c92-d15ebba242a6", "product": {"name": "core"}, "product_version": "< 2024.1.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c23247eb-8b52-3bc2-8841-ae7df3ffc76b", "vendor": {"name": "home-assistant"}}], "isExploited": false}
