By creating a trailing-dot folder and placing a same-basename script, Nero BackItUp renders the file as a folder icon and then invokes ShellExecuteW, which executes the script via PATHEXT fallback (.COM/.EXE/.BAT/.CMD). The issue affects recent Nero BackItUp product lines (2019-2025 and earlier) and has been acknowledged by the vendor.", "datePublished": "2025-11-14T21:30:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T21:30:29", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/PotatoHamm/Nero-Productline-Vulnerability", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63680"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-63680"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "43586400-7453-3189-bbdd-128126836dd6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d363fc6-7729-303b-b433-a7f90ec34575", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
