This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity associated with a token generated. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to generate valid auth tokens and leverage that to auto-login as other accounts, including administrators, as long as the administrator has the 2FA set up.", "datePublished": "2025-10-15T08:25:50", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T15:28:36", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1850e6bd-04bc-4510-aba9-e51431363231?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/keyy/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10293"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10293"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "90e43405-f4cf-3fc4-ae60-20154608ce57", "product": {"name": "Keyy Two Factor Authentication (like Clef)"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0c9c71ff-01dd-300f-8551-b18453c288d4", "vendor": {"name": "nexist"}}], "isExploited": false}
