When reading data from a squash4 filesystem, grub's squash4 fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciously crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the direct_read() will perform a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.", "datePublished": "2025-03-03T17:05:41", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T19:59:58", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0678", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0678", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2346118"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-0678", "GHSA-q67r-p3hc-x2w9"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "25adf3ba-801b-364e-8d42-28e88c2fe8bf", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
