For Cilium users who use Gateway API for Ingress for some services and use LB-IPAM or BGP for LB Service implementation and use network policies to block egress traffic from workloads in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces, egress traffic from workloads covered by such network policies to LoadBalancers configured by `Gateway` resources will incorrectly be allowed. LoadBalancer resources not deployed via a Gateway API configuration are not affected by this issue. This issue affects: Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.14 inclusive, v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive, and v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.15.15, v1.16.8, and v1.17.2. A Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy can be used to work around this issue for users who are unable to upgrade.", "datePublished": "2025-03-24T18:44:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-24T19:30:18", "baseScore": 3.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-24qp-4xx8-3jvj", "https://github.com/cilium/proxy/pull/1172", "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam", "https://github.com/cilium/cilium"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-30162", "GHSA-24qp-4xx8-3jvj"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0caa3bc6-1572-3a8c-bda1-1fd773addb42", "product": {"name": "cilium"}, "product_version": "1.16.0, < 1.16.8"}, {"id": "175d9da7-f5fe-37ed-9e1c-31de8f5ebeba", "product": {"name": "cilium"}, "product_version": "1.15.0, < 1.15.15"}, {"id": "b383be85-bc10-395d-b121-ef2001b90f0e", "product": {"name": "cilium"}, "product_version": "1.17.0, < 1.17.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff95ce83-dd5a-3e1c-a4e5-35d94e8296cc", "vendor": {"name": "cilium"}}], "isExploited": false}
