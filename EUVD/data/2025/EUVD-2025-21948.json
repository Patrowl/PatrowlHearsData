This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin, which is likely to be used alongside, allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, leading to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.", "datePublished": "2025-07-19T04:23:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-21T17:42:46", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a0146f17-35bd-45cf-b9c6-c4fce688efc2?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/integration-for-contact-form-7-and-google-sheets/#developers", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/integration-for-contact-form-7-and-google-sheets/tags/1.1.1/integration-for-contact-form-7-and-google-sheets.php#L923", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3329005/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7697"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07a5344e-fb99-3191-9d25-f0f95806e9eb", "product": {"name": "Integration for Google Sheets and Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Ninja Forms"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d8b19ba-4d73-3cc2-a776-8d2f884c744a", "vendor": {"name": "crmperks"}}], "isExploited": false}
