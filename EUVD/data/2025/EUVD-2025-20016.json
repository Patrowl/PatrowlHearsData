This was done by storing the MIME type of a file and allowing only browser preview for MIME types beginning with image (except for image/svg+xml, see CVE-2022-30110 and CVE-2024-12326), video and audio. However, it was possible to bypass this check by sending a manipulated MIME type containing a comma and an other MIME type like text/html (for example image/png,text/html). Browsers see multiple MIME types and text/html would takes precedence, allowing a possible attacker to do a cross-site scripting attack. The check for MIME types was enhanced to prevent a browser preview when the stored MIME type contains a comma.", "datePublished": "2025-07-04T12:02:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-16T11:01:26", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://gitlab.com/jirafeau/Jirafeau/-/commit/79464ec6276e8eb0e0b0ad597db02b85080d2b63", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-30110", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-12326"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7066"], "assigner": "GitLab", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3351b194-4502-3c94-b0c5-c45e6615c24a", "product": {"name": "Jirafeau"}, "product_version": "0 <4.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "817c218d-285e-3d34-a0c0-659a35546761", "vendor": {"name": "Jirafeau project"}}], "isExploited": false}
