Unbound is also vulnerable when compiled with ECS support, i.e., '--enable-subnet', AND configured to send ECS information along with queries to upstream name servers, i.e., at least one of the 'send-client-subnet', 'client-subnet-zone' or 'client-subnet-always-forward' options is used. Resolvers supporting ECS need to segregate outgoing queries to accommodate for different outgoing ECS information. This re-opens up resolvers to a birthday paradox attack (Rebirthday Attack) that tries to match the DNS transaction ID in order to cache non-ECS poisonous replies.", "datePublished": "2025-07-16T14:38:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T18:13:56", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/R:U/V:C", "references": ["https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2025-5994.txt", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5994", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/08/msg00019.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5994"], "assigner": "NLnet Labs", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e606ee47-1ea1-3317-bbb3-d2463f04fe51", "product": {"name": "Unbound"}, "product_version": "1.6.2 <1.23.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e2290c48-e0dc-38c9-acdb-45929cbab7e3", "vendor": {"name": "NLnet Labs"}}], "isExploited": false}
