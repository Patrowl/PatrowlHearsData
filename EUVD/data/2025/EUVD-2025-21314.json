It has been declared as critical. This vulnerability affects the function sendCommand of the file runcmd.sh. The manipulation of the argument cmd leads to command injection. The attack can be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation appears to be difficult. The researcher highlights, that \"[a]lthough this functionality is currently disabled due to server CGI configuration errors, it is essentially a 'time bomb' waiting to be activated\".
