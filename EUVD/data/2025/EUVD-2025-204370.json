After PFCP association, a PFCP Session Establishment Request that includes a CreateFAR with an empty or truncated IPv4 address field is not properly validated. During parsing, parseFAR() calls ip2int(), which performs an out-of-bounds read on the IPv4 address buffer and triggers an index-out-of-range panic. An attacker who can send PFCP Session Establishment Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.", "datePublished": "2025-12-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-19T18:01:06", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65568", "https://github.com/omec-project/upf/issues/962", "http://omec-projectupf.com", "http://upf-epc-pfcpiface.com"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65568", "GHSA-hg6h-53hm-4646"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "111ad2a9-d0c3-3745-80c2-346292ae39d5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7333eb1-5c3b-3cf2-8ea8-2ed12e18c00a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
