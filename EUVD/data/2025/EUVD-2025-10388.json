Specifically, the app\u2019s code is not obfuscated, and no measures are in place to protect against decompilation, disassembly, or debugging. As a result, attackers can reverse-engineer the application to gain insights into its internal workings, which can potentially lead to the discovery of sensitive information, business logic flaws, and other vulnerabilities.\nUtilizing this flaw, the attacker was able to identify the Hardcoded credentials from PortalUsersDatabase.dll, which contains .NET remoting definition. Inside the namespace PortalUsersDatabase, the class Users contains the functions CreateAdmin and CreateService that are used to initialize accounts in the Portal service. Both CreateAdmin and CreateService functions contain a hardcoded encrypted password along with its respective salt that are set with the function SetInitialPasswordAndSalt.\nThis issue affects IntelliSpace Portal: 12 and prior; Advanced Visualization Workspace: 15.", "datePublished": "2025-04-07T18:30:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-10T18:32:02", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/S:P/AU:Y/R:U/V:C/RE:M/U:Green", "references": ["https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-3426", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3426", "https://www.philips.com/a-w/security/security-advisories.html#security_advisories"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3426"], "assigner": "Philips", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "31f8b82b-1a35-3d96-ab17-e08af3110e88", "product": {"name": "IntelliSpace Portal"}, "product_version": "12 and prior"}, {"id": "def7cbbc-b940-3d47-87f4-a6f93dbc8b9b", "product": {"name": "Advanced Visualization Workspace"}, "product_version": "15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa4f8810-2c44-3e02-9cf2-14d650c76db6", "vendor": {"name": "Philips"}}], "isExploited": false}
