However the URLs used\nby these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.\n\nIn this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.\nFurthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be\npassed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have\na 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the\nissue was assessed as Low severity.\n\nThe vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:\n3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary.", "datePublished": "2025-09-30T13:17:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:15:19", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2b4ec20e47959170422922eaff25346d362dcb35", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7cf21a30513c9e43c4bc3836c237cf086e194af3", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/bbf38c034cdabd0a13330abcc4855c866f53d2e0", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/89e790ac431125a4849992858490bed6b225eadf", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/654dc11d23468a74fc8ea4672b702dd3feb7be4b", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9232", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/30/5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-9232"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0796ca76-8f28-35f3-a89a-841b27a3c8a8", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.4.0 <3.4.3"}, {"id": "19a837f3-b6bd-33b2-afb5-02dd70b7f8af", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.0.16 <3.0.18"}, {"id": "59b30a17-6600-39fb-b6c3-0ebc61c68e97", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.3.3 <3.3.5"}, {"id": "920ebbea-7897-3d1d-abec-77062f1c2a81", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.5.0 <3.5.4"}, {"id": "f2475768-e7ba-363c-af7f-130560da6c46", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.2.4 <3.2.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "885e82fa-e01f-37f1-a348-2048619a2336", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
