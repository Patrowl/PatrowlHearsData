An authenticated attacker who is able to load policy can use the policy yaml parser to reference files on the Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted server. These references may be used as reconnaissance to better understand the folder structure of the Secrets Manager/Conjur server or to have the yaml parser include files on the server in the yaml that is processed as the policy loads. This issue affects Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly Conjur Enterprise) prior to versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 and Conjur OSS prior to version 1.22.1. Conjur OSS version 1.22.1 and Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted versions 13.5.1 and 13.6.1 fix the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-07-15T20:04:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:11:29", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/security/advisories/GHSA-7m6h-fqrm-m9c5", "https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/releases/tag/v1.22.1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-49830"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "430d0a99-e3bb-3302-9cff-0be87d53dd2b", "product": {"name": "conjur"}, "product_version": "Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly known as Conjur Enterprise) < 13.5.1"}, {"id": "942cd952-dd9a-300f-8bc4-3342adbbe3ae", "product": {"name": "conjur"}, "product_version": "Secrets Manager, Self-Hosted (formerly known as Conjur Enterprise) = 13.6"}, {"id": "c969a2cf-ae58-332a-87ea-21f8604530d4", "product": {"name": "conjur"}, "product_version": "Conjur OSS < 1.22.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7a0c7a78-42d0-33a3-9c7c-24d6012f64ec", "vendor": {"name": "CyberArk"}}], "isExploited": false}
