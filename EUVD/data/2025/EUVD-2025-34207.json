In versions before 9.1.9, a vulnerability allows arbitrary user creation, including administrative accounts, through a combination of stored SVG injection and lack of CSRF protection. An attacker with Knowledge Base edit permissions can embed a malicious SVG element containing a link in the body field of an article. When an authenticated user clicks the malicious link, they are redirected to an attacker-controlled HTML page that executes a CSRF request against the api/v1/User endpoint. If the victim is prompted for and enters their credentials, an attacker-controlled account is created with privileges determined by the CSRF payload. This issue has been patched in version 9.1.9.", "datePublished": "2025-10-14T14:38:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-14T16:03:42", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/security/advisories/GHSA-c26c-wvhr-fr6r"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59428"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "41226313-ab76-3715-b51b-6585481fb7f8", "product": {"name": "espocrm"}, "product_version": "< 9.1.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f3b1f66b-3ec8-3b23-8287-519bb71bb137", "vendor": {"name": "espocrm"}}], "isExploited": false}
