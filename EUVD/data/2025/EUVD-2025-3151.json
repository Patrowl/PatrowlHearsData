Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges.", "datePublished": "2025-01-24T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T20:41:30", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1229918", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/24/3", "https://security.opensuse.org/2025/01/24/dde-api-proxy-privilege-escalation.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-23222"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "52904e78-c866-359d-89ad-e4d2c4bd792c", "product": {"name": "dde-api-proxy"}, "product_version": "0 \u22641.0.19"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b698c95b-b851-3944-887f-5deb6877ecce", "vendor": {"name": "Deepin"}}], "isExploited": false}
