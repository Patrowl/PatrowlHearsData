Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, working with large buffers in Lua scripts can lead to a stack overflow. Users of Lua rules and output scripts may be affected when working with large buffers. This includes a rule passing a large buffer to a Lua script. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. A workaround for this issue involves disabling Lua rules and output scripts, or making sure limits, such as stream.depth.reassembly and HTTP response body limits (response-body-limit), are set to less than half the stack size.", "datePublished": "2025-11-26T23:05:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-28T15:30:15", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-93fh-cgmc-w3rx", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/e13fe6a90dba210a478148c4084f6f5db17c5b5a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-64344"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "003ab379-9aff-3664-adc7-d175a89cd2e5", "product": {"name": "suricata"}, "product_version": "< 8.0.2"}, {"id": "a0bca9f9-6027-3911-a415-33b2aa187faf", "product": {"name": "suricata"}, "product_version": "< 7.0.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1320d437-37c8-337f-b0e8-7e926569e968", "vendor": {"name": "OISF"}}], "isExploited": false}
