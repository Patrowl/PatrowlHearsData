A potential DXE memory corruption vulnerability has been identified. The root cause is use of a pointer originating from the value of an NVRAM variable as the target of a write operation. This can be leveraged by an attacker to perform arbitrary writes, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue has been fixed in kernel 5.2, Version 05.29.44; kernel 5.3, Version 05.38.44; kernel 5.4, Version 05.46.44; kernel 5.5, Version 05.54.44; kernel 5.6, Version 05.61.44; and kernel 5.7, Version 05.70.44.", "datePublished": "2025-04-16T00:31:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-16T21:30:53", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49200", "https://www.insyde.com/security-pledge/SA-2024015"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-49200", "GHSA-jx72-hjqg-63p5"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c5e77df-feaa-3534-b8f6-fa15a0012644", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f25990e4-5c02-3b83-9867-766425be7851", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
