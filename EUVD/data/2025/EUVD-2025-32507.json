Versions before 1.0.111 were vulnerable to Code Injection due to a bug in the startup trust dialog implementation. Claude Code could be tricked to execute code contained in a project before the user accepted the startup trust dialog. Exploiting this requires a user to start Claude Code in an untrusted directory. Users on standard Claude Code auto-update will have received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.111.", "datePublished": "2025-10-03T06:34:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-03T13:26:23", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/security/advisories/GHSA-4fgq-fpq9-mr3g", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59536", "https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59536", "GHSA-4fgq-fpq9-mr3g"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ad4cf173-06f3-31e5-ab2e-651ba84dcb13", "product": {"name": "claude-code"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.111"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "07e6ca03-ec56-3df4-96bd-c253d9101427", "vendor": {"name": "anthropics"}}], "isExploited": false}
