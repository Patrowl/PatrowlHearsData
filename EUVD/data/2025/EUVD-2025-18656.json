An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted HTTPS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco AnyConnect VPN server to restart, resulting in the failure of all established SSL VPN sessions and forcing remote users to initiate a new VPN connection and re-authenticate. A sustained attack could prevent new SSL VPN connections from being established, effectively making the Cisco AnyConnect VPN service unavailable for all legitimate users.", "datePublished": "2025-06-18T16:38:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-18T17:58:55", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-meraki-mx-vpn-dos-sM5GCfm7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20271"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b2347b6f-d4ab-3172-b517-80d1b1dc809f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Meraki MX Firmware"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1e61553a-2b73-34df-8ddd-f80275b10f1a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
