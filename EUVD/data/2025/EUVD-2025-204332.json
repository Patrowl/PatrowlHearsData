After PFCP association, a specially crafted PFCP Session Establishment Request with a CreatePDR that contains a malformed Flow-Description is not robustly validated. The Flow-Description parser (parseFlowDesc) can read beyond the bounds of the provided buffer, causing a panic and terminating the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Session Establishment Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF.", "datePublished": "2025-12-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-19T18:01:12", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65567", "https://github.com/omec-project/upf/issues/959"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65567", "GHSA-w3v7-wwmg-2j8p"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "776cfd6c-f533-38b2-8091-22f46e3d43b4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bc43ef4b-0216-3807-abd2-7f3026923b73", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
