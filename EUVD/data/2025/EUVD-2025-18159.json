This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in when verifying an account with an email address. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as registered users, including administrators, if they know user's email address. This is only exploitable fi the user's confirmation_key has not already been set by the plugin.", "datePublished": "2025-06-12T05:23:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-12T13:07:20", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8e7693a3-642a-4eff-902c-d29a3c12deb0?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/workreap-freelance-marketplace-wordpress-theme/23712454#item-description__release-3-3-2-23-may-2025", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4973"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-4973"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d43d8fe9-3599-3562-91bd-2524278a0b99", "product": {"name": "Workreap"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "40bceaf5-9c7d-315c-8ff0-dd4f41ca549d", "vendor": {"name": "AmentoTech"}}], "isExploited": false}
