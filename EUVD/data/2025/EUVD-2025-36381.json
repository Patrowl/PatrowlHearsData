Prior to 4.8.0, users with a local account can change their password while logged in. When doing so, all other active sessions are terminated, except for the currently active one. However, the current session\u2019s token remains valid and is not refreshed. If an attacker has previously obtained this session token through another vulnerability, changing the password will not invalidate their access. As a result, the attacker can continue to act as the user even after the password has been changed.
