Prior to versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2, if a SIP request is received with an Authorization header that contains a realm that wasn't in a previous 401 response's WWW-Authenticate header, or an Authorization header with an incorrect realm was received without a previous 401 response being sent, the get_authorization_header() function in res_pjsip_authenticator_digest will return a NULL. This wasn't being checked before attempting to get the digest algorithm from the header which causes a SEGV. This issue has been patched in versions 20.15.2, 21.10.2, and 22.5.2. There are no workarounds.", "datePublished": "2025-08-28T15:33:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-28T15:33:00", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/security/advisories/GHSA-64qc-9x89-rx5j", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/pull/1407", "https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/02993717b08f899d4aca9888062f35dfb198584f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-57767"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2456b93d-5f89-34a5-b25d-b378d6fee59c", "product": {"name": "asterisk"}, "product_version": "< 22.5.2"}, {"id": "529683a0-8fb9-39f3-94ed-d6faaac92992", "product": {"name": "asterisk"}, "product_version": "< 21.10.2"}, {"id": "c54f0804-dbaa-3638-8cf9-ea619e433fc8", "product": {"name": "asterisk"}, "product_version": "< 20.15.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "97dcb2d7-5e16-3e28-bbd4-7051fa225e1f", "vendor": {"name": "asterisk"}}], "isExploited": false}
