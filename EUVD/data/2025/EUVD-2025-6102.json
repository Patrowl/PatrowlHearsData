In affected versions, proxy configuration data\u2014potentially including sensitive details\u2014was written to log files in clear text whenever an HTTP GET request was made through a proxy. An attacker with read access to these logs could obtain the proxy information and leverage it for further attacks or unauthorized access. Starting with version 4.39.0, Docker Desktop no longer logs the proxy string, thereby mitigating this risk.", "datePublished": "2025-03-06T11:58:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-06T16:15:52", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1696", "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/#proxies", "https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/troubleshoot/#check-the-logs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-1696", "GHSA-x75c-f5w5-hw79"], "assigner": "Docker", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "38b0dc6f-50f4-318b-bb59-dbf48d459ac7", "product": {"name": "Docker Desktop"}, "product_version": "0 <4.39.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e1d8191c-234b-311e-b12f-3cfde52b2e8e", "vendor": {"name": "Docker"}}], "isExploited": false}
