Everywhere else,\n&pl->phydev->lock is acquired at the top level, and &pl->state_mutex at\nthe lower level. A clear example is phylink_bringup_phy().\n\nThe outlier is the newly introduced phy_config_inband() and the existing\nlock order is the correct one. To understand why it cannot be the other\nway around, it is sufficient to consider phylink_phy_change(), phylink's\ncallback from the PHY device's phy->phy_link_change() virtual method,\ninvoked by the PHY state machine.\n\nphy_link_up() and phy_link_down(), the (indirect) callers of\nphylink_phy_change(), are called with &phydev->lock acquired.\nThen phylink_phy_change() acquires its own &pl->state_mutex, to\nserialize changes made to its pl->phy_state and pl->link_config.\nSo all other instances of &pl->state_mutex and &phydev->lock must be\nconsistent with this order.\n\nProblem impact\n==============\n\nI think the kernel runs a serious deadlock risk if an existing\nphylink_resolve() thread, which results in a phy_config_inband() call,\nis concurrent with a phy_link_up() or phy_link_down() call, which will\ndeadlock on &pl->state_mutex in phylink_phy_change(). Practically\nspeaking, the impact may be limited by the slow speed of the medium\nauto-negotiation protocol, which makes it unlikely for the current state\nto still be unresolved when a new one is detected, but I think the\nproblem is there. Nonetheless, the problem was discovered using lockdep.\n\nProposed solution\n=================\n\nPractically speaking, the phy_config_inband() requirement of having\nphydev->lock acquired must transfer to the caller (phylink is the only\ncaller). There, it must bubble up until immediately before\n&pl->state_mutex is acquired, for the cases where that takes place.\n\nSolution details, considerations, notes\n=======================================\n\nThis is the phy_config_inband() call graph:\n\n                          sfp_upstream_ops :: connect_phy()\n                          |\n                          v\n                          phylink_sfp_connect_phy()\n                          |\n                          v\n                          phylink_sfp_config_phy()\n                          |\n                          |   sfp_upstream_ops :: module_insert()\n                          |   |\n                          |   v\n                          |   phylink_sfp_module_insert()\n                          |   |\n                          |   |   sfp_upstream_ops :: module_start()\n                          |   |   |\n                          |   |   v\n                          |   |   phylink_sfp_module_start()\n                          |   |   |\n                          |   v   v\n                          |   phylink_sfp_config_optical()\n phylink_start()          |   |\n   |   phylink_resume()   v   v\n   |   |  phylink_sfp_set_config()\n   |   |  |\n   v   v  v\n phylink_mac_initial_config()\n   |   phylink_resolve()\n   |   |  phylink_ethtool_ksettings_set()\n   v   v  v\n   phylink_major_config()\n            |\n            v\n    phy_config_inband()\n\nphylink_major_config() caller #1, phylink_mac_initial_config(), does not\nacquire &pl->state_mutex nor do its callers.
