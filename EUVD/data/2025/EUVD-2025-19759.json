A local low-privileged attacker can hijack the COM class identifier (CLSID) registration used by Chrome's elevation service and point it to a non-existent or malicious binary. When this hijack occurs, Chrome silently falls back to the legacy cookie encryption mechanism (protected only by user-DPAPI), thereby enabling cookie decryption by any user-context malware without SYSTEM-level access. This flaw bypasses the protections intended by the AppBound encryption design and allows cookie theft from Chromium-based browsers.\n\nConfirmed in Google Chrome with AppBound Encryption enabled. Other Chromium-based browsers may be affected if they implement similar COM-based encryption mechanisms.", "datePublished": "2025-07-02T19:25:13", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-03T03:55:39", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/c4-bomb-blowing-up-chromes-appbound-cookie-encryption", "https://vulncheck.com/advisories/google-chrome-appbound-cookie-encryption"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34090"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c206a15b-16a7-3105-ab9a-4852a173a1dc", "product": {"name": "Chrome"}, "product_version": "127 <129"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9bbd756-03c6-391f-a4b0-ac0889255086", "vendor": {"name": "Google"}}], "isExploited": false}
