Prior to version 0.20.1, the library fails to enforce configured size limits on incoming request bodies when `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` is used or when no `Content-Length` header is provided. A remote attacker can send a chunked request without the terminating zero-length chunk, causing uncontrolled memory allocation on the server. This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application. Configure the proxy to enforce maximum request body size limits, thereby stopping excessively large requests before they reach the vulnerable library code.", "datePublished": "2025-05-06T00:45:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T02:43:44", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/security/advisories/GHSA-px83-72rx-v57c", "https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib/commit/7b752106ac42bd5b907793950d9125a0972c8e8e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46728"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81e7c190-c282-3d20-9acb-563c58e83501", "product": {"name": "cpp-httplib"}, "product_version": "< 0.20.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d61c106e-e96b-3b09-a076-afd454e03a90", "vendor": {"name": "yhirose"}}], "isExploited": false}
