Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow, where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one - and could lead to potential repository takeover. This is fixed by commit 3f61e79.", "datePublished": "2025-07-30T13:41:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-30T13:54:21", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/security/advisories/GHSA-wrg3-xqw8-m85p", "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/commit/3f61e79102910bd355e920a2df7e44c14c9cb247"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54430"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "958ee0f8-84b8-3d3d-8cc3-8656318009d2", "product": {"name": "dedupe"}, "product_version": "< 3f61e79102910bd355e920a2df7e44c14c9cb247"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "875a89e1-f5ff-3de7-9c84-49b13386cfa9", "vendor": {"name": "dedupeio"}}], "isExploited": false}
