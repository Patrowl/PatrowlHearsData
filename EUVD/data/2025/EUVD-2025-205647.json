Velociraptor is normally only allowed to write in the datastore directory. The issue occurs due to insufficient sanitization of directory names which end with a \".\", only encoding the final \".\" AS \"%2E\".\n\n\nAlthough files can be written to incorrect locations, the containing directory must end with \"%2E\". This limits the impact of this vulnerability, and prevents it from overwriting critical files.", "datePublished": "2025-12-29T19:04:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-30T22:26:47", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://docs.velociraptor.app/announcements/advisories/cve-2025-14728/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14728"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14728"], "assigner": "rapid7", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "66684a10-55c6-32cd-bc15-43982815e85b", "product": {"name": "Velociraptor"}, "product_version": "0 <0.75.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83ea6f75-f9f3-3248-9628-cc97129c6e3c", "vendor": {"name": "Rapid7"}}], "isExploited": false}
