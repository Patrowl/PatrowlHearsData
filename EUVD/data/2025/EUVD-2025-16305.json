The only known potential exploit is if the script is included in the name of a Kubernetes \u201cRole\u201d object* that is applied to a secured cluster. This object can be used by a user with access to the cluster or through a compromised third-party product.", "datePublished": "2025-05-27T20:51:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T21:09:55", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5198", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2368568", "https://github.com/stackrox/stackrox/pull/13336"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5198"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9bb2ee49-cc5a-39da-b16f-e88d4d9dbdb0", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
