The client communicates user-controlled file paths to a privileged service, which performs file system operations without impersonating the requesting user. Due to improper privilege handling and a time-of-check time-of-use race condition combined with symbolic link and mount point manipulation, a local authenticated attacker can coerce the service into deleting arbitrary directories with SYSTEM privileges. This can be exploited to delete protected system folders such as C:\\\\Config.msi and subsequently achieve execution as NT AUTHORITY\\\\SYSTEM via MSI rollback techniques.", "datePublished": "2025-12-20T20:01:42", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-22T16:17:23", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34290", "https://security-portal.versa-networks.com/emailbulletins/69421e33d03aafc8e5bdaf21", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/versa-sase-client-for-windows-arbitrary-file-deletion-leading-to-lpe"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34290", "GHSA-x6v7-6q76-p2cx"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "607738f4-a3b9-3619-9b6a-fbcad6303795", "product": {"name": "SASE Client for Windows"}, "product_version": "7.8.7 <7.9.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c9361f2-801a-3783-94f4-8810e64071ae", "vendor": {"name": "Versa Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
