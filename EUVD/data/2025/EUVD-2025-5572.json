When performing a symlink lookup from a reiserfs filesystem, grub's reiserfs fs module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem geometry to determine the internal buffer size, however, it improperly checks for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculations to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result, the grub_reiserfs_read_symlink() will call grub_reiserfs_read_real() with a overflown length parameter, leading to a heap based out-of-bounds write during data reading. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and can result in arbitrary code execution, by-passing secure boot protections.", "datePublished": "2025-03-03T17:14:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-20T20:00:05", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-0684", "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-0684", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2346119"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-0684", "GHSA-mf4f-2vjv-3rq6"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5456f44f-9945-38fe-bd38-983d69d07e81", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
