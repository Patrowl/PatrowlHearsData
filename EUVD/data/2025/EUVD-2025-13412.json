Prior to version 6.5.0, `{field}.isFilterable` access control can be bypassed in `update` and `delete` mutations by adding additional unique filters. These filters can be used as an oracle to probe the existence or value of otherwise unreadable fields. Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.", "datePublished": "2025-05-05T18:53:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-05T19:00:01", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/security/advisories/GHSA-hg9m-67mm-7pg3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-46720", "https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46720", "GHSA-hg9m-67mm-7pg3"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ee1a995-9924-322a-86a1-ba08f3e45fb2", "product": {"name": "Keystone"}, "product_version": "< 6.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "35bade08-cb93-3718-938c-653b0f9dfce9", "vendor": {"name": "keystonejs"}}], "isExploited": false}
