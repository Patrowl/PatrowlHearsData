Via a type confusion bug in versions of the CPython interpreter starting in 3.11 and prior to 3.13.2 when using `try/except*`, RestrictedPython starting in version 6.0 and prior to version 8.0 could be bypassed. The issue is patched in version 8.0 of RestrictedPython by removing support for `try/except*` clauses. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2025-01-23T17:34:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T20:41:29", "baseScore": 7.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/security/advisories/GHSA-gmj9-h825-chq2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22153", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython/commit/48a92c5bb617a647cffd0dadd4d5cfe626bcdb2f", "https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-22153", "GHSA-gmj9-h825-chq2"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a73cea5-bd2e-3fb4-9a13-5db2a8654056", "product": {"name": "RestrictedPython"}, "product_version": "6.0, < 8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "297186b5-16ca-31cb-a7c2-4197277ac6ac", "vendor": {"name": "zopefoundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
