In version 8.0.0, rules using keyword ldap.responses.attribute_type (which is long) with transforms can lead to a stack buffer overflow during Suricata startup or during a rule reload. This issue is fixed in version 8.0.1. To workaround this issue, users can disable rules with ldap.responses.attribute_type and transforms.", "datePublished": "2025-10-01T20:07:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-01T20:17:41", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-vxcg-38x4-gj7j", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/38a2cba5c397002047d84645f5ab770ff88020e1", "https://forum.suricata.io/t/suricata-8-0-1-and-7-0-12-released/6018", "https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/7861"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59149"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a9a2649-e902-3295-8674-98b68e795c9d", "product": {"name": "suricata"}, "product_version": "8.0.0, < 8.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7701621d-980e-3eaf-92ed-ea187e3f50a8", "vendor": {"name": "OISF"}}], "isExploited": false}
