This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting ICO files, allowing double extension files with the appropriate magic bytes to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid ICO file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "datePublished": "2025-11-18T09:27:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-18T21:10:52", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/5716c4e1-a6d3-42e8-b90c-d16f204c8503?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-svg-webp-ico-upload/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13069"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13069"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fe473b50-2b40-3861-8186-e6bae7d8bcff", "product": {"name": "Enable SVG, WebP, and ICO Upload"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ebad0126-c99f-3673-b026-c1c2f612d977", "vendor": {"name": "ideasToCode"}}], "isExploited": false}
