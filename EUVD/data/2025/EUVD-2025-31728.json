However, given that it is\npossible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled\nwith the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be\nrecoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate\nseverity issue.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm.", "datePublished": "2025-09-30T13:17:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:15:18", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fc47a2ec078912b3e914fab5734535e76c4820c2", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/eed5adc9f969d77c94f213767acbb41ff923b6f4", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/567f64386e43683888212226824b6a179885a0fe", "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cba616c26ac8e7b37de5e77762e505ba5ca51698", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9231", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/30/5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-9231"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2fec0329-1768-3e81-ba68-505c5831371c", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.5.0 <3.5.4"}, {"id": "9acb5fd1-f5ba-3c43-b5cf-6cdeeb24fe59", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.4.0 <3.4.3"}, {"id": "aab1b125-6e8d-3ace-b997-37034821463d", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.3.0 <3.3.5"}, {"id": "f51ce896-5a4a-3df2-8543-df1d282ae446", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "3.2.0 <3.2.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01358cb8-b17e-391a-bd9e-8fb18558b0fa", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
