Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions less than 1.3.9. If the file is a dotfile, editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn't. Hence, if sensitive editor files, such as the .vscode/settings.json file don't already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9.", "datePublished": "2025-08-05T00:12:28", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-05T13:57:58", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-vqv7-vq92-x87f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54130"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "647e9be1-b381-32eb-9837-e8f1684424b3", "product": {"name": "cursor"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8e49ad1d-64ce-311a-9db2-57e787b8db4e", "vendor": {"name": "cursor"}}], "isExploited": false}
