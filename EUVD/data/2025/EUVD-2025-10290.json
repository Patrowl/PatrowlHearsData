Through the store-api it is possible as a attacker to check if a specific e-mail address has an account in the shop. Using the store-api endpoint /store-api/account/recovery-password you get the response, which indicates clearly that there is no account for this customer. In contrast you get a success response if the account was found. This vulnerability is fixed in Shopware 6.6.10.3 or 6.5.8.17. For older versions of 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.", "datePublished": "2025-04-08T13:46:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-08T18:46:21", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/U:Green", "references": ["https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-hh7j-6x3q-f52h", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30150", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/releases/tag/v6.5.8.17", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/releases/tag/v6.6.10.3", "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/releases/tag/v6.7.0.0-rc2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-30150", "GHSA-hh7j-6x3q-f52h"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "466e59ca-cbba-3ea6-a95f-5d8dcb30cf3a", "product": {"name": "shopware"}, "product_version": "6.6.0.0, < 6.6.10.3"}, {"id": "bb39dc4e-33f0-3dd4-8f37-256675fa8d4e", "product": {"name": "shopware"}, "product_version": "< 6.5.8.17"}, {"id": "fa96a795-1081-3b33-9278-bf96bfc3103d", "product": {"name": "shopware"}, "product_version": "6.7.0.0-rc1, < 6.7.0.0-rc2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e0916186-652b-35b5-ac08-83521393f39b", "vendor": {"name": "shopware"}}], "isExploited": false}
