Prior to version 11.0.0, in the HAX site editor, users can create a website block to load another site in an iframe. The application allows users to supply a target URL in the website block. When the HAX site is visited, the client's browser will query the supplied URL. An authenticated attacker can create a HAX site with a website block pointing at an attacker-controlled server running Responder or a similar tool. The attacker can then conduct a phishing attack by convincing another user to visit their malicious HAX site to harvest credentials. Version 11.0.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-06-09T21:08:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-10T15:29:40", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/security/advisories/GHSA-v3ph-2q5q-cg88", "https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs/commit/5368eb9b278ca47cd9a83b8d3e6216375615b8f5", "https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49139"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-49139", "GHSA-v3ph-2q5q-cg88"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ae35cfd5-c42b-3292-bbd6-8b5f018ae452", "product": {"name": "issues"}, "product_version": "< 11.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9b7ffac7-2324-3cfb-a3a3-ac6269bd8837", "vendor": {"name": "haxtheweb"}}], "isExploited": false}
