This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to retrieve sensitive credentials, which can be used to perform actions on behalf of the project, access private data, and delete resources. The private API keys are exposed in the developer tools when the endpoint is called from the frontend.", "datePublished": "2025-03-20T10:10:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-20T18:18:54", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9099", "https://github.com/lunary-ai/lunary/commit/8ba1b8ba2c2c30b1cec30eb5777c1fda670cbbfc", "https://huntr.com/bounties/ffb84fe8-3e60-4200-ac2d-1fd1e1c93e91"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-9099", "GHSA-qjq5-7g6p-p3vg"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1d7f51a4-5724-3ba7-8607-e959951cc9c5", "product": {"name": "lunary-ai/lunary"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.5.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a7368627-ba29-3811-ac78-c6cd1646264e", "vendor": {"name": "lunary-ai"}}], "isExploited": false}
