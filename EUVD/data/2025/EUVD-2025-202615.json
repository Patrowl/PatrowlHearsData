The Secure Boot feature ensures that only authenticated software can execute on the device. The Secure Boot process forms a chain of trust by verifying all mutable software entities involved in the Application Startup Flow. As a result, an attacker with physical access to the device can flash modified firmware to the device, resulting in the execution of malicious code upon startup.", "datePublished": "2025-12-10T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-11T20:09:25", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/dead1nfluence/Meatmeet-Pro-Vulnerabilities/blob/main/Device/Secure-Boot-Disabled.md", "https://gist.github.com/dead1nfluence/4dffc239b4a460f41a03345fd8e5feb5#file-secure-boot-disabled-md", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65829"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65829"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "20adf140-df63-3b36-98b6-fd820b8190c3", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "967f0f3c-2252-3d9c-bfc3-6db7a4bdeb82", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
