Starting in version 3.4.0 and prior to version 3.4.2, a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in the application's filter configuration. The CSRF protection mechanism was **explicitly disabled**, allowing the application to process state-changing requests (POST) without verifying a valid CSRF token. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious web page. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser is forced to send unauthorized requests to the application. A successful exploit allows the attacker to silently create a new Administrator account with full privileges, leading to a complete takeover of the system and loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The vulnerability has been patched in version 3.4.2. The fix re-enables the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` and resolves associated AJAX race conditions by adjusting token regeneration settings. As a workaround, administrators can manually re-enable the CSRF filter in `app/Config/Filters.php` by uncommenting the protection line. However, this is not recommended without applying the full patch, as it may cause functionality breakage in the Sales module due to token synchronization issues.", "datePublished": "2025-12-17T22:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-18T15:06:38", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/security/advisories/GHSA-wjm4-hfwg-5w5r", "https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/pull/4349", "https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/commit/d575c8da9a1d7af8313a1e758e000e243f5614ef", "https://github.com/Nixon-H/CVE-2025-68434-OSPOS-CSRF-Unauthorized-Administrator-Creation"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-68434"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e8b6dc5-a56d-3573-8402-dbe5a8d43584", "product": {"name": "opensourcepos"}, "product_version": "3.4.0, < 3.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3887a425-3a9a-368d-a85e-c8add9dff1da", "vendor": {"name": "opensourcepos"}}], "isExploited": false}
