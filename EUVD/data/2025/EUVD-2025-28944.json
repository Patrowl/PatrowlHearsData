This patch fixes the error flow for moving\ncomplex rules:\n - If new rule creation fails before it was even enqeued, do not\n   poll for completion\n - If TIMEOUT happened while moving the rule, no point trying\n   to poll for completions for other rules. Something is broken,\n   completion won't come, just abort the rehash sequence.\n - If some other completion with error received, don't give up.\n   Continue handling rest of the rules to minimize the damage.\n - Make sure that the first error code that was received will\n   be actually returned to the caller instead of replacing it\n   with the generic error code.\n\nAll the aforementioned issues stem from the same bad error flow,\nso no point fixing them one by one and leaving partially broken\ncode - fixing them in one patch.", "datePublished": "2025-09-11T18:35:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-25T21:32:04", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/37d54bc28d092bc3b314da45d730f00e9d86ec2a", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a842b1bf18a32ee0c25dd6dd98728b786a76fe4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39768"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-39768"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03dae076-df1c-36d5-a219-b5a1828f088c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16.4"}, {"id": "6be4ca82-dbd8-33d2-85a3-7e0e91590c3f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17"}, {"id": "6d8b3cbb-b1f4-36de-8765-a5577851c6ee", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.16"}, {"id": "8d0c644b-f215-3886-bcaf-1ccee3d6e8df", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17-rc3"}, {"id": "bd571768-cf2d-354e-ade9-ef21f858fa04", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "c5ce7780-cec5-3be9-90e4-a764ce1349c6", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "17e0accac577fd6ea2090934d71a8c6f36702a26 <37d54bc28d092bc3b314da45d730f00e9d86ec2a"}, {"id": "ecfcac2a-9937-3a39-a156-9e73e648c1a7", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "17e0accac577fd6ea2090934d71a8c6f36702a26 <4a842b1bf18a32ee0c25dd6dd98728b786a76fe4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a5bf1ecd-12d9-3622-b2fa-52eb466ae629", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
