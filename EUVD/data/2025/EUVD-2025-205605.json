The Meshtastic firmware (starting from version 2.5) introduces asymmetric encryption (PKI) for direct messages, but when the `pki_encrypted` flag is missing, the firmware silently falls back to legacy AES-256-CTR channel encryption. This was an intentional decision to maintain backwards compatibility. However, the end-user applications, like Web app, iOS/Android app, and applications built on top of Meshtastic using the SDK, did not have a way to differentiate between end-to-end encrypted DMs and the legacy DMs. This creates a downgrade attack path where adversaries who know a shared channel key can craft and inject spoofed direct messages that are displayed as if they were PKC encrypted. Users are not given any feedback of whether a direct message was decrypted with PKI or with legacy symmetric encryption, undermining the expected security guarantees of the PKI rollout. Version 2.7.15 fixes this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-12-29T16:18:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-29T16:52:03", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/security/advisories/GHSA-377p-prwp-4hwf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53627"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c7162496-2cf2-31ba-a7b6-f9139042feda", "product": {"name": "firmware"}, "product_version": "2.5, < 2.7.15"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9ca459a-b3d8-3658-9e41-7c3c23edcea0", "vendor": {"name": "meshtastic"}}], "isExploited": false}
