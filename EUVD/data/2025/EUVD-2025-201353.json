This is due to insufficient file type validation detecting WXR files, allowing double extension files to bypass sanitization while being accepted as a valid WXR file. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "datePublished": "2025-12-05T03:28:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-05T15:58:13", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7df0ea8a-5e2c-4f5e-a326-b92df37ffa3c?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3400301/demo-importer-plus/trunk/inc/importers", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13066"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13066"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4d4bf137-a4ea-3433-8d41-d4ecd2c048c0", "product": {"name": "Demo Importer Plus"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.0.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "79342fc1-01f6-3420-b627-05bbd52688f7", "vendor": {"name": "Kraftplugins"}}], "isExploited": false}
