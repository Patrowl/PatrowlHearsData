Turns out the assumption does\nnot hold for speculative execution paths. See example in the next\npatch.\n\nmaybe_scc_exit() is called from update_branch_counts() for states that\nreach branch count of zero, meaning that path exploration for a\nparticular path is finished. Path exploration can finish in one of\nthree ways:\na. Verification error is found. In this case, update_branch_counts()\n   is called only for non-speculative paths.\nb. Top level BPF_EXIT is reached. Such instructions are never a part of\n   an SCC, so compute_scc_callchain() in maybe_scc_exit() will return\n   false, and maybe_scc_exit() will return early.\nc. A checkpoint is reached and matched. Checkpoints are created by\n   is_state_visited(), which calls maybe_enter_scc(), which allocates\n   bpf_scc_visit instances for checkpoints within SCCs.\n\nHence, for non-speculative symbolic execution paths, the assumption\nstill holds: if maybe_scc_exit() is called for a state within an SCC,\nbpf_scc_visit instance must exist.\n\nThis patch removes the verifier_bug() call for speculative paths.", "datePublished": "2025-11-12T10:23:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-01T06:18:52", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3861e7c4324aa20a632fb74eb3904114f6afdb57", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3c73d629ea1373af3c0c954d41fd1af555492e3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40143"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-40143"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "638e6872-bd48-3e32-86a3-60a80b201fde", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18-rc1"}, {"id": "63eb16a4-3196-3872-8be6-f6b563af9d80", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "c9e31900b54cadf5398dfb838c0a63effa1defec <a3c73d629ea1373af3c0c954d41fd1af555492e3"}, {"id": "6838726a-648a-3f29-9a5c-afb2ef0ac3fb", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17.3"}, {"id": "68b6d81b-d6a7-33c1-bab1-8bd527999fd1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.17"}, {"id": "7901245d-2559-39b5-82fd-065b281d5bf1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18"}, {"id": "bb23b704-3d12-3b0f-852d-ba7b235db281", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "fa751537-af75-377e-95a2-bb50a847625f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "c9e31900b54cadf5398dfb838c0a63effa1defec <3861e7c4324aa20a632fb74eb3904114f6afdb57"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f7787445-0b11-36f0-93cd-bfa4acdb39e3", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
