This includes\neverything from kernel stacks to kernel text.  Handling\nexceptions on arbitrary accesses to kernel memory is essentially\nimpossible because they can happen in horribly nasty places like\nkernel entry/exit.  But, TDX hardware can theoretically _deliver_\na virtualization exception (#VE) on any access to private memory.\n\nBut, it's not as bad as it sounds.  TDX can be configured to never\ndeliver these exceptions on private memory with a \"TD attribute\"\ncalled ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE.  The guest has no way to *set* this\nattribute, but it can check it.\n\nEnsure ATTR_SEPT_VE_DISABLE is set in early boot.  panic() if it\nis unset.  There is no sane way for Linux to run with this\nattribute clear so a panic() is appropriate.\n\nThere's small window during boot before the check where kernel\nhas an early #VE handler. But the handler is only for port I/O\nand will also panic() as soon as it sees any other #VE, such as\na one generated by a private memory access.\n\n[ dhansen: Rewrite changelog and rebase on new tdx_parse_tdinfo().\n\t   Add Kirill's tested-by because I made changes since\n\t   he wrote this. ]", "datePublished": "2025-05-01T15:31:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-10T21:30:29", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-49886", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/373e715e31bf4e0f129befe87613a278fac228d3", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/895c168c8f78079f21ad50fead7593ffa352f795"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-49886", "GHSA-8ww3-pfqc-q6wm"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4060ffd0-3e01-30b6-9d86-1fcabf827559", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.19"}, {"id": "a6e152b8-4038-3130-a375-c03eb4ea5f8e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "a8ddf457-486b-3806-866b-436346a96124", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9a22bf6debbf5169f750af53c7f86eb4e3cd6712 <895c168c8f78079f21ad50fead7593ffa352f795"}, {"id": "b1c04c3e-01a4-37ed-a8f6-5593e75b125d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9a22bf6debbf5169f750af53c7f86eb4e3cd6712 <373e715e31bf4e0f129befe87613a278fac228d3"}, {"id": "c4a8034f-7831-388f-b0a2-2ce92a22640e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1"}, {"id": "f1a8d79c-090a-327d-a734-990aaa2870dd", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.0.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "790a3aae-7d03-381a-95ad-8044f53304c9", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
