In versions prior to 2025.4.10, a race condition vulnerability has been identified in the conda-forge-webservices component used within the shared build infrastructure. This vulnerability, categorized as a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) issue, can be exploited to introduce unauthorized modifications to build artifacts stored in the cf-staging Anaconda channel. Exploitation may result in the unauthorized publication of malicious artifacts to the production conda-forge channel. The core vulnerability results from the absence of atomicity between the hash validation and the artifact copy operation. This gap allows an attacker, with access to the cf-staging token, to overwrite the validated artifact with a malicious version immediately after hash verification, but before the copy action is executed. As the cf-staging channel permits artifact overwrites, such an operation can be carried out using the anaconda upload --force command. This vulnerability is fixed in 2025.4.10.", "datePublished": "2025-04-15T21:56:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-17T14:25:10", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-webservices/security/advisories/GHSA-28cx-74fp-g2g2", "https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-webservices/commit/141ed27617068debd150956341551df3a5a3807d"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32784"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dcba36e9-af95-3092-aae4-7f3175c21716", "product": {"name": "conda-forge-webservices"}, "product_version": "< 2025.4.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b226980-c0aa-3083-a96e-7d8772133500", "vendor": {"name": "conda-forge"}}], "isExploited": false}
