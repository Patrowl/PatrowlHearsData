An overly permissive CORS configuration (allow_origins='*' with allow_credentials=True) combined with a refresh token cookie configured as SameSite=None allows a malicious webpage to perform cross-origin requests that include credentials and successfully call the refresh endpoint. An attacker-controlled origin can therefore obtain fresh access_token / refresh_token pairs for a victim session. Obtained tokens permit access to authenticated endpoints \u2014 including built-in code-execution functionality \u2014 allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code and achieve full system compromise.", "datePublished": "2025-12-05T22:27:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-08T20:46:49", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://www.obsidiansecurity.com/blog/cve-2025-34291-critical-account-takeover-and-rce-vulnerability-in-the-langflow-ai-agent-workflow-platform", "https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/langflow-cors-misconfiguration-to-token-hijack-and-rce", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34291"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34291"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f323aafb-0a42-3400-94b7-f4c39d93d116", "product": {"name": "langflow"}, "product_version": "0 \u22641.6.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7086fd6-c8d1-37b1-be0b-b0d26fb47665", "vendor": {"name": "Langflow"}}], "isExploited": false}
