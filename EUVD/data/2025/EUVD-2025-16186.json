A change caused a regression resulting in sessions not being properly invalidated. A user that logged out of the Wire webapp, could have been automatically logged in again after re-opening the application. This does not happen when the user is logged in as a temporary user by selecting \"This is a public computer\" during login or the user selects \"Delete all your personal information and conversations on this device\" upon logout. The underlying issue has been fixed with wire-webapp version 2025-05-20-production.0. As a workaround, this behavior can be prevented by either deleting all information upon logout as well as logging in as a temporary client.", "datePublished": "2025-05-22T17:04:42", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-22T17:32:16", "baseScore": 5.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/security/advisories/GHSA-7r6m-qjwm-w44q"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48061"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8930ea9a-a308-39ed-8106-9b9835266862", "product": {"name": "wire-webapp"}, "product_version": "< 2025-05-20-production.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "86ddf15d-051d-339b-a931-c980a9014b8a", "vendor": {"name": "wireapp"}}], "isExploited": false}
