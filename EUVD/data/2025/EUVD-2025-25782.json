Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Cursor, potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent. \n\nThis issue was detected in 15.4.1 version of Cursor. Project maintainers decided not to fix this issue, because a scenario including a local attacker falls outside their defined threat model.", "datePublished": "2025-08-26T12:22:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-26T13:58:15", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://afine.com/threat-of-tcc-bypasses-on-macos/#cooking-cursor-app", "https://github.com/cursor/cursor", "https://cert.pl/posts/2025/08/tcc-bypass/", "https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-xp8w-f7f4-r544"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-9190"], "assigner": "CERT-PL", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7d2034dd-a150-3407-ad95-d0d4ec78c67f", "product": {"name": "cursor"}, "product_version": "15.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "403f2fe9-6c3d-3ce8-a831-4acf2a28dc2d", "vendor": {"name": "cursor"}}], "isExploited": false}
