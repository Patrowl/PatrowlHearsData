This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized before the `ninja-forms-views` REST endpoints return form metadata and submission content. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary form definitions and submission records via a leaked bearer token granted they can load any page containing the Submissions Table block. NOTE: The developer released a patch for this issue in 3.13.1, but inadvertently introduced a REST API endpoint in which a valid bearer token could be minted for arbitrary form IDs, making this patch ineffective.", "datePublished": "2025-12-17T06:42:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-17T21:42:22", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/4240cdae-9122-443e-8a7e-3369e74384be?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3415563/ninja-forms", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11924"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11924"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9146c43d-9203-3e72-b94d-270a1b9eea73", "product": {"name": "Ninja Forms \u2013 The Contact Form Builder That Grows With You"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.13.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "162d4374-a425-31e7-bb56-3ae03df88d21", "vendor": {"name": "kstover"}}], "isExploited": false}
