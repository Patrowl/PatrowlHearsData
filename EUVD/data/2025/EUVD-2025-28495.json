Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.", "datePublished": "2025-08-18T20:09:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:11:44", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://lists.apache.org/thread/2gj8tjl6vz949nnp3yxz3okm9xz2k7sp", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53192", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/08/18/4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53192"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "98730dce-4582-368f-96bc-1c1722583107", "product": {"name": "Apache Commons OGNL"}, "product_version": "0 <*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b9981636-61a0-3c6b-a9e8-88f648fc573f", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
