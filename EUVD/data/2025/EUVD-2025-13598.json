An HTTP header injection vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix.", "datePublished": "2025-05-06T14:55:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T19:51:34", "baseScore": 3.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/security/advisories/GHSA-77q8-qmj7-x7pp", "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/commit/0b003fda4c678c1b514e95f319aee88113e9bf4b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46814"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bdc4473c-eecd-3e23-b673-0608ecb3cfb9", "product": {"name": "fastapi-guard"}, "product_version": "< 2.0.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7f39e0d3-fe83-3eed-8727-3b13bc1e420c", "vendor": {"name": "rennf93"}}], "isExploited": false}
