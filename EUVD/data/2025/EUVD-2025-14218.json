During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C:\\ProgramData\\Docker\\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C:\\ProgramData\\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.", "datePublished": "2025-04-28T19:21:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-28T19:43:24", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3224", "https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/3/16/abusing-arbitrary-file-deletes-to-escalate-privilege-and-other-great-tricks"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3224", "GHSA-6233-jj46-vp44"], "assigner": "Docker", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c02b03f0-ba79-389e-a0f8-7c806c360aa4", "product": {"name": "Docker Desktop"}, "product_version": "0 <4.41.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ed250da-964d-365e-a7fd-95dda3f7d4dc", "vendor": {"name": "Docker"}}], "isExploited": false}
