PILOS before 4.8.0 includes a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration in its middleware: it reflects the Origin request header back in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header without proper validation or a whitelist, while Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is set to true. This behavior could allow a malicious website on a different origin to send requests (including credentials) to the PILOS API. This may enable exfiltration or actions using the victim\u2019s credentials if the server accepts those cross-origin requests as authenticated. Laravel\u2019s session handling applies additional origin checks such that cross-origin requests are not authenticated by default. Because of these session-origin protections, and in the absence of any other unknown vulnerabilities that would bypass Laravel\u2019s origin/session checks, this reflected-Origin CORS misconfiguration is not believed to be exploitable in typical PILOS deployments. This vulnerability has been patched in PILOS in v4.8.0", "datePublished": "2025-10-27T20:10:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-27T20:38:52", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/THM-Health/PILOS/security/advisories/GHSA-pgfw-f4mp-5445", "https://github.com/THM-Health/PILOS/commit/14655bc4f8128ffd2b3c25004b01d9a802808da8"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62523"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db32f0d3-08a3-3732-aa4c-1f7ccbd011ac", "product": {"name": "PILOS"}, "product_version": "< 4.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6a99e8e5-c559-3a20-9a57-010dd04c432a", "vendor": {"name": "THM-Health"}}], "isExploited": false}
