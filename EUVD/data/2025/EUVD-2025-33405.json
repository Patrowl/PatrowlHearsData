In versions prior to 5.6.0, upon authentication, the user could be associated by e-mail even if the `associate_by_email` pipeline was not included. This could lead to account compromise when a third-party authentication service does not validate provided e-mail addresses or doesn't require unique e-mail addresses. Version 5.6.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, review the authentication service policy on e-mail addresses; many will not allow exploiting this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-10-09T20:57:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-15T19:49:22", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/security/advisories/GHSA-wv4w-6qv2-qqfg", "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/220", "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/231", "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/issues/634", "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/pull/803", "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django/commit/10c80e2ebabeccd4e9c84ad0e16e1db74148ed4c", "https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61783"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61783", "GHSA-wv4w-6qv2-qqfg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ae953d6-820e-36fc-828c-c3afc94872ec", "product": {"name": "social-app-django"}, "product_version": "< 5.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b596478c-0b18-31e5-8f40-2053c30daedf", "vendor": {"name": "python-social-auth"}}], "isExploited": false}
