The real existence of this vulnerability is still doubted at the moment. The identifier of the patch is 5705d99cc1f23f36f9a84aab26d1724010b97798. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The documentation explains that the parameter -T is experimental and \"crashy\". Further analysis has shown \"the race is not a real problem unless you use asan\". A new warning has been added.", "datePublished": "2025-06-05T07:31:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-05T18:12:13", "baseScore": 2.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://vuldb.com/?id.311133", "https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.311133", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.586922", "https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues/24234", "https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/issues/24234#issuecomment-2918847551", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LVaraZB30lJXtrvp-4bcEJrZYFJb2bfc/view?usp=sharing", "https://github.com/radareorg/radare2/commit/5705d99cc1f23f36f9a84aab26d1724010b97798", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5645"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5645"], "assigner": "VulDB", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6ad564c8-3ca2-3605-a795-bb5e2f56b932", "product": {"name": "radare2"}, "product_version": "5.9.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b374f6a4-2b77-3e62-bab5-da6e07bf7e8b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
