A BPv7 bundle with a malformed extension block causes uncontrolled memory allocation inside ION-DTN 4.1.3s, leading to receiver thread termination and a Denial-of-Service (DoS). The triggering bundle contains an extension block starting at `0x85070201005bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`. The first byte in the extension block (0x85) indicates a CBOR array of five elements of which the first four are numbers (0x07, 0x02, 0x01, 0x00) but the fifth element is a byte string of length 27 (`0x5bbb0e20b4ea001a000927c0...`). The vulnerability seems to be due to processing the fifth element of the array (i.e., the byte string) as replacing it with a number makes the vulnerability no longer be triggered. While parsing this extension block, ION obtains a very large block length, which in the code in `bei.c`:764) seems to be passed from `blockLength` which is an unsigned int, to a 32 bit signed integer `blkSize`. The unsigned to signed conversion causes `blkSize` to hold the value of -369092043, which is then converted into a 64-bit unsigned value inside `MTAKE(blkSize)`, resulting in an attempt to allocate an unrealistic amount of memory, causing the error. As of time of publication, no known patched versions of BPv7 exist.", "datePublished": "2025-10-07T19:31:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-07T19:57:34", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN/security/advisories/GHSA-xm96-38vj-h28h", "https://github.com/nasa-jpl/ION-DTN/blob/ion-open-source-4.1.3s/bpv7/library/bei.c#L758-L769"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61910"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b5ca49df-a004-3a91-be76-7189315cecf4", "product": {"name": "ION-DTN"}, "product_version": "= 4.1.3s"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0977f6f3-db6b-3689-bf93-6ca2bf5addcc", "vendor": {"name": "nasa-jpl"}}], "isExploited": false}
