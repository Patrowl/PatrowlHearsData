At the end of the issuing function we set NETFS_RREQ_ALL_QUEUED\nto indicate to the collector that we aren't going to issue any more subreqs\nand that it can do the final notifications and cleanup.\n\nNow, this isn't a problem if the request is synchronous\n(NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION is unset) as the result collection will be\ndone in-thread and we're guaranteed an opportunity to run the collector.\n\nHowever, if the request is asynchronous, collection is primarily triggered\nby the termination of subrequests queuing it on a workqueue.  Now, a race\ncan occur here if the app thread sets ALL_QUEUED after the last subrequest\nterminates.\n\nThis can happen most easily with the copy2cache code (as used by Ceph)\nwhere, in the collection routine of a read request, an asynchronous write\nrequest is spawned to copy data to the cache.  Folios are added to the\nwrite request as they're unlocked, but there may be a delay before\nALL_QUEUED is set as the write subrequests may complete before we get\nthere.\n\nIf all the write subreqs have finished by the ALL_QUEUED point, no further\nevents happen and the collection never happens, leaving the request\nhanging.\n\nFix this by queuing the collector after setting ALL_QUEUED.  This is a bit\nheavy-handed and it may be sufficient to do it only if there are no extant\nsubreqs.\n\nAlso add a tracepoint to cross-reference both requests in a copy-to-request\noperation and add a trace to the netfs_rreq tracepoint to indicate the\nsetting of ALL_QUEUED.", "datePublished": "2025-07-28T12:30:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-19T18:31:17", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/110188a13c4853bd4c342e600ced4dfd26c3feb5", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/89635eae076cd8eaa5cb752f66538c9dc6c9fdc3", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38492"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-38492"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "06d3f5df-392f-3682-afa2-ec7dd0a19295", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16"}, {"id": "08165eb0-f2bd-3f06-9b8b-ec08a3370391", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.14"}, {"id": "2d732bf6-7455-3f3e-9f12-55a467c45400", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.15.8"}, {"id": "94dccc22-6196-3ad7-873f-8c316dd93e9f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "e2d46f2ec332533816417b60933954173f602121 <110188a13c4853bd4c342e600ced4dfd26c3feb5"}, {"id": "cb8795f7-29a2-3214-b14e-656d68133a3f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "f617f05d-5734-3c06-a75f-cc86541b1c80", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "e2d46f2ec332533816417b60933954173f602121 <89635eae076cd8eaa5cb752f66538c9dc6c9fdc3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f9c98920-98dd-39e6-ac74-ff9c535bc4a0", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
