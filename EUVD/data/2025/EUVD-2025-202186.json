The AddressesBcc value is not properly sanitized when processed via a GET request and is reflected within a <script> block in the JavaScript variable var sAddrBcc. By supplying a crafted payload that terminates the existing LoadCurAddresses() function, inserts attacker-controlled script, and comments out remaining code, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim\u2019s browser when the victim attempts to send an email. Successful exploitation can redirect victims to malicious sites, steal non-HttpOnly cookies, and perform actions as the authenticated user.", "datePublished": "2025-12-09T18:30:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-10T00:30:22", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N", "references": ["https://mailenable.com/Standard-ReleaseNotes.txt", "https://www.mailenable.com/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/mailenable-reflected-xss-in-addressesbcc-parameter-of-addressbook-aspx", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34398"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34398"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55f2c478-0147-3f34-b1ee-60b538be3254", "product": {"name": "MailEnable"}, "product_version": "0 <10.54"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "853f82dd-642b-30ac-8ac7-035f3dc3a779", "vendor": {"name": "MailEnable"}}], "isExploited": false}
