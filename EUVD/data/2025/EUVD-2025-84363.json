This is due to the plugin storing cPanel API credentials (hostname, username, and API key) in files within the web-accessible wp-content directory without adequate protection in the \"Tnc_Wp_Toolbox_Settings::save_settings\" function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve these credentials and use them to interact with the cPanel API, which can lead to arbitrary file uploads, remote code execution, and full compromise of the hosting environment.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T11:03:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T15:29:41", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2eaa5a5c-c11f-40d0-be69-c3ec8029a819?source=cve", "https://github.com/The-Network-Crew/TNC-Toolbox-for-WordPress/commit/31bb3040b22c84e2d6dfd3210fe0ad045ff4ddf6", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12539"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12539"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aeb1c7c3-8f2e-3d81-a9d8-03b4d227a596", "product": {"name": "TNC Toolbox: Web Performance"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.4.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ae7fdc50-2aae-3a9c-9ceb-695dfe453467", "vendor": {"name": "leopardhost"}}], "isExploited": false}
