Because the key is hardcoded, any attacker who can gain container-level access can simply read the files and obtain the private key. With the private key, the attacker can decrypt TLS traffic, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, or forge TLS certificates.\u00a0This enables impersonation of the appliance\u2019s web UI, interception of credentials, and unrestricted access to any services that trust the certificate. The same key is identical across all deployed appliances meaning a single theft compromises the confidentiality of every Vasion Print installation.\u00a0This vulnerability has been identified by the vendor as: V-2024-025 \u2014 Hardcoded SSL Certificate & Private Keys.", "datePublished": "2025-09-29T20:36:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-17T23:56:34", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2025-04-08-vasion-printerlogic-83-vulnerabilities.html#va-hardcoded-ssl-private-key", "https://help.printerlogic.com/va/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://help.printerlogic.com/saas/Print/Security/Security-Bulletins.htm", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/vasion-print-printerlogic-hardcoded-ssl-certificate-and-private-keys", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34211"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34211"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "14b7ec71-4ea7-3c5c-9ad1-e4c2c16690f9", "product": {"name": "Print Virtual Appliance Host"}, "product_version": "* <22.0.1049"}, {"id": "4733693c-3242-37be-bdae-c9c787fcbadd", "product": {"name": "Print Application"}, "product_version": "* <20.0.2786"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c88fa5b7-bf30-3b34-b085-c0716775aba5", "vendor": {"name": "Vasion"}}], "isExploited": false}
