Prior to version b5662, an attacker\u2010supplied GGUF model vocabulary can trigger a buffer overflow in llama.cpp\u2019s vocabulary\u2010loading code. Specifically, the helper _try_copy in llama.cpp/src/vocab.cpp: llama_vocab::impl::token_to_piece() casts a very large size_t token length into an int32_t, causing the length check (if (length < (int32_t)size)) to be bypassed. As a result, memcpy is still called with that oversized size, letting a malicious model overwrite memory beyond the intended buffer. This can lead to arbitrary memory corruption and potential code execution. This issue has been patched in version b5662.", "datePublished": "2025-06-17T20:04:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-18T13:41:11", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/security/advisories/GHSA-8wwf-w4qm-gpqr", "https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/commit/3cfbbdb44e08fd19429fed6cc85b982a91f0efd5"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-49847"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a6acb8c0-0233-36e6-ac18-4f801a74f181", "product": {"name": "llama.cpp"}, "product_version": "< b5662"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "08ac688d-4896-35a6-b3cb-e635ce7a2930", "vendor": {"name": "ggml-org"}}], "isExploited": false}
