When an administrator initiates \"Open Remote Terminal\" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices.", "datePublished": "2025-09-22T18:30:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-23T21:30:54", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-57601", "https://github.com/Shubhangborkar/aikaan-vulnerabilities/blob/main/cve1-shared-ssh-key.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-57601", "GHSA-fj6f-975w-5xrx"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4ed3a132-cc26-3eb7-9edb-5cd331f6cac0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0af1caf7-9725-32ad-8fd2-3df037ee6f61", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
