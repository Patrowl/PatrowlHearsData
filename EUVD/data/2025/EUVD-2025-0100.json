{"id": "EUVD-2025-0100", "enisaUuid": "ea1bb6b2-3c40-384d-b624-cfcada4a6a2f", "description": "Crayfish is a collection of Islandora 8 microservices, one of which, Homarus, provides FFmpeg as a microservice. Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.", "datePublished": "2025-02-13T00:36:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-13T15:08:05", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw", "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89", "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-25286"], "aliases": ["GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw", "CVE-2025-25286"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d67df0c-daea-392c-831f-c4b9760c399c", "product": {"name": "Crayfish"}, "product_version": "< 4.1.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "16155bf1-8725-35f4-bc09-e1ddb66101ab", "vendor": {"name": "Islandora"}}], "isExploited": false}
