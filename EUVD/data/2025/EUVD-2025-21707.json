A vulnerability exists in the EncryptionUtil class because symmetric encryption is implemented in a deterministic and non-randomized fashion. The method Encrypt(byte[] clearData) derives both the encryption key and the IV from a fixed, hardcoded input by using a static salt value. As a result, identical plaintext inputs always produce identical ciphertext outputs. This is true for both FIPS and non-FIPS generated passwords. In other words, there is a cryptographic implementation flaw in the password encryption mechanism. Although there are multiple encryption methods grouped under FIPS and non-FIPS classifications, the logic consistently results in predictable and reversible encrypted outputs due to the lack of per-operation randomness and encryption authentication.", "datePublished": "2025-07-16T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-24T15:25:43", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://galacticadvisors.com", "https://codykretsinger.com", "https://www.galacticadvisors.com/release/critical-vulnerabilities-in-network-detective/", "https://www.galacticadvisors.com/release/cve/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32874"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f28bba43-5675-3752-a033-b469828366ef", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b7363cb-f4ba-3fb8-819f-bfc9b5ad86eb", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
