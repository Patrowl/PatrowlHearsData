Unprivileged software adversary with an unauthenticated user combined with a low complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via adjacent access when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) impacts.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T16:51:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T15:28:27", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:H", "references": ["https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01398.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-33029"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-33029"], "assigner": "intel", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2fb0c917-28f2-3e28-86be-9fe19806b0c2", "product": {"name": "Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless WiFi Software for Windows"}, "product_version": "before version 23.160"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2a10f603-71ee-3293-807e-a3e4d899b34a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
