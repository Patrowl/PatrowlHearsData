In that case writing them back will further\ncorrupting the fs.", "datePublished": "2025-12-08T03:31:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-08T03:31:01", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/066ee13f05fbd82ada01883e51f0695172f98dff", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e2b3859067bf012d53c49b3f885fef40624a2c83", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/54a5b5a15588e3b0b294df31474d08a2678d4291", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2618849f31e7cf51fadd4a5242458501a6d5b315", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40303"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-40303"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c9f8c39-a4b4-3cb0-86c3-2d368ad7c408", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <e2b3859067bf012d53c49b3f885fef40624a2c83"}, {"id": "46f87043-4858-3e30-bb4f-e3c6fdfc17cb", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <066ee13f05fbd82ada01883e51f0695172f98dff"}, {"id": "48d32604-3fb9-37ff-a4f4-7663ec036254", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18"}, {"id": "60f4aac8-571a-3c49-a24f-4b16a498c460", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.6.117"}, {"id": "61c87f88-dc88-367b-a963-4eba833fb430", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17.8"}, {"id": "65feacaa-5e27-3716-a5f4-58063a9bf3d0", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.58"}, {"id": "e6156fe7-7d04-382f-ad32-2246bb21d0c8", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <54a5b5a15588e3b0b294df31474d08a2678d4291"}, {"id": "e82fbd56-8abb-3a60-961a-6150bd6dbe07", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <2618849f31e7cf51fadd4a5242458501a6d5b315"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e4632f45-d672-355d-8edb-f43a2a73dc3c", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
