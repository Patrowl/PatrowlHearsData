Prior to versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2, a single byte read heap overflow when logging the verdict in eve.alert and eve.drop records can lead to crashes. This requires the per packet alert queue to be filled with alerts and then followed by a pass rule. This issue has been patched in versions 7.0.13 and 8.0.2. To reduce the likelihood of this issue occurring, the alert queue size a should be increased (packet-alert-max in suricata.yaml) if verdict is enabled.", "datePublished": "2025-11-26T23:03:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-28T15:36:34", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/OISF/suricata/security/advisories/GHSA-83v7-gm34-f437", "https://github.com/OISF/suricata/commit/482e5eac9218d007adbe2410d6c00173368ce947"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-64330"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c8e6859c-dcbd-3953-9f0b-212912b59977", "product": {"name": "suricata"}, "product_version": "< 7.0.13"}, {"id": "e3a2e501-0904-372a-87e0-9b46b37ce658", "product": {"name": "suricata"}, "product_version": "< 8.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c804a04d-e648-3d84-a976-3ef0dd7ed50c", "vendor": {"name": "OISF"}}], "isExploited": false}
