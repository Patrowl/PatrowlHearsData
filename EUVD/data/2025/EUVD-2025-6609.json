In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available.", "datePublished": "2025-03-17T22:48:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-17T22:48:40", "baseScore": 8.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-3f5x-r59x-p8cf", "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/ca39cb96f21e76102aefb956d2c8c0ba0bd143ca"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-29912"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc80e30b-91b0-3d6e-8f96-b591266e215e", "product": {"name": "CryptoLib"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4068dbe2-c676-331e-a933-4b637cff40fa", "vendor": {"name": "NASA"}}], "isExploited": false}
