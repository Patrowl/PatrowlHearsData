One can Remotely Dump Video Footage and the Live Video Stream. It exposes API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092 that allow remote access to recorded and live video feeds. An attacker who connects to the dashcam's network can retrieve all stored recordings and convert them from JDR format to MP4. Additionally, port 9092's RTSP stream can be accessed remotely, allowing real-time video feeds to be extracted without the owner's knowledge.", "datePublished": "2025-03-18T21:32:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-18T21:32:01", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://www.gnetsystem.com/eng/product/list?viewMode=view&idx=246&ca_id=0201", "https://github.com/geo-chen/GNET", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30141"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-30141"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0d90565d-f6c6-36b3-8210-9339f4862176", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6af721d6-8dbb-35e9-89f7-3f97bbbf944b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
