This interface can be called by any user who has completed login authentication, and it returns the plaintext authentication Tokens of all users currently logged in to the system. As a result, ordinary users can obtain the administrator's authentication Token through this interface, thereby forging an administrator account, gaining the system's management permissions, and taking over the system.", "datePublished": "2025-11-07T18:30:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-07T21:31:20", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://github.com/pig-mesh/pig/issues/1202", "https://github.com/LockeTom/vulnerability/blob/main/md/pig_Information_disclosure_vulnerability.md", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63691"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-63691"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "57babdbf-00a5-341e-abe7-2128634fd644", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7e5798da-3f71-32ce-82b0-e1310513c4fd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
