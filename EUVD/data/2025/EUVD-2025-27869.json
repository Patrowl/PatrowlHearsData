This quickly turns\ninto a soft lockup, RCU stalls and deadlocks, inflicting severe\nheadaches to the whole system.\n\nWhen the timeout has expired, we don't need to schedule a hrtimer, but\nwe should set the `timed_out` variable.  Therefore, I suggest moving\nthe ep_schedule_timeout() check into the `timed_out` expression\ninstead of skipping it.\n\nbrauner: Note that there was an earlier fix by Joe Damato in response to\nmy bug report in [1].", "datePublished": "2025-06-18T12:30:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T21:30:27", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7631dca012593c95d36199082546a24a0058fc50", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d9ec73301099ec5975505e1c3effbe768bab9490", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38017"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-38017"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81f95ec3-204f-3662-b7a8-1c74fb73fd74", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "99a0ad16dfd114a429df665065dcc576dad743c0 <7631dca012593c95d36199082546a24a0058fc50"}, {"id": "a06b17ba-5f3a-3984-8008-0d372252a417", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "0a65bc27bd645894175c059397b4916e31955fb2 <d9ec73301099ec5975505e1c3effbe768bab9490"}, {"id": "f9f15177-8acf-3014-8a78-dd555b50da58", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.14.4 <6.14.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7cc2f7af-6e7f-3aff-881d-4803ba399155", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
