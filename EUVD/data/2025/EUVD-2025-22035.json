The function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() takes a head argument that is documented as an output argument. The documentation does not suggest that the function will free that pointer; however, the function does call mbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on that argument, which performs a deep free(). As a result, application code that uses this function (relying only on documented behavior) is likely to still hold pointers to the memory blocks that were freed, resulting in a high risk of use-after-free or double-free. In particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req are affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).", "datePublished": "2025-07-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T20:04:39", "baseScore": 8.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tech-updates/security-advisories/", "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls-docs/blob/main/security-advisories/mbedtls-security-advisory-2025-06-7.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-47917"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d7c7048-97ba-3eb3-8f9a-4bcb7bc2c569", "product": {"name": "mbedtls"}, "product_version": "0 <3.6.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f6333b90-1c86-3736-a775-0952b04ea08b", "vendor": {"name": "Mbed"}}], "isExploited": false}
