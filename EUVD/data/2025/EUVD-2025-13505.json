Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-05-05T18:35:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-05T18:46:57", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-3p2w-xmv5-jm95", "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/d10fdfe9738b17a9d81037c031b40a2cc4cb8038"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46340"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb201d05-cde7-31a3-b757-03822acb7bd9", "product": {"name": "misskey"}, "product_version": "12.0.0, < 2025.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "74f86fad-2b8b-375f-a5fc-4067d7515396", "vendor": {"name": "misskey-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
