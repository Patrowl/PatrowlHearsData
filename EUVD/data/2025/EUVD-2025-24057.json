This issue affects some unknown processing of the file /etc/strongswan.conf of the component strongSwan. The manipulation of the argument i_dont_care_about_security_and_use_aggressive_mode_psk leads to missing encryption of sensitive data. The attack may be initiated remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitation is known to be difficult.
