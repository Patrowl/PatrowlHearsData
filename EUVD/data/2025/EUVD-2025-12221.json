Prior to version 7.2.7, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 7.2.7. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.", "datePublished": "2025-04-22T17:45:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-23T15:59:07", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/cuba-platform/restapi/security/advisories/GHSA-88h5-34xw-2q56", "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32960", "https://github.com/cuba-platform/restapi/commit/b3d599f6657d7e212fdb134a61ab5e0888669eb1", "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html", "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-cuba-application", "https://github.com/cuba-platform/restapi"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32960", "GHSA-88h5-34xw-2q56"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "db0dbc65-7254-36e4-a193-3550d40381ea", "product": {"name": "restapi"}, "product_version": "< 7.2.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "99dd2b2e-1409-38ae-9773-6180f3268af3", "vendor": {"name": "cuba-platform"}}], "isExploited": false}
