This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform administrative actions in the `bwfan_test_email` AJAX handler. The nonce used for verification is publicly exposed to all visitors (including unauthenticated users) via the frontend JavaScript localization, and the `check_nonce()` function accepts low-privilege authenticated users who possess this nonce. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to send arbitrary emails from the site with attacker-controlled subject and body content.", "datePublished": "2025-11-05T09:27:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-05T15:39:59", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12469", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-marketing-automations/trunk/includes/abstracts/class-bwfan-ajax-controller.php#L296", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-marketing-automations/trunk/includes/class-bwfan-common.php#L1896", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-marketing-automations/trunk/includes/class-bwfan-public.php#L70", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3388822/wp-marketing-automations/trunk/includes/abstracts/class-bwfan-ajax-controller.php", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/72198b74-90f6-49c6-b261-6f9c1cdc9692?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12469", "GHSA-5ppg-2735-mfmv"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "37db033a-28d8-3acb-9efd-4cf0236e000a", "product": {"name": "FunnelKit Automations \u2013 Email Marketing Automation and CRM for WordPress & WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "* \u22643.6.4.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "54b78195-b1e8-38ad-8864-c5030a7e80d0", "vendor": {"name": "amans2k"}}], "isExploited": false}
