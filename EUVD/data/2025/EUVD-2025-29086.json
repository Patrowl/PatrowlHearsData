This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-09-12T21:25:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-15T15:11:05", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/d449a285-34f5-41ed-acfd-2a9acfb04271?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hackrepair-plugin-archiver/tags/2.0.4/includes/list.php#L39", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10176"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10176"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eef99d39-16f3-31b6-9161-efcf075a09d7", "product": {"name": "The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.0.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1100fb2b-d26f-3085-bc9a-3532c1a17cca", "vendor": {"name": "tvcnet"}}], "isExploited": false}
