In ClipBucket version 5.5.2, a change to network.class.php causes the application to dynamically build the server URL from the incoming HTTP Host header when the configuration base_url is not set. Because Host is a client-controlled header, an attacker can supply an arbitrary Host value. This allows an attacker to cause password-reset links (sent by forget.php) to be generated with the attacker\u2019s domain. If a victim follows that link and enters their activation code on the attacker-controlled domain, the attacker can capture the code and use it to reset the victim\u2019s password and take over the account. This issue has been patched in version 5.5.2#162.", "datePublished": "2025-11-20T16:50:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-21T16:33:09", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-xhhf-mpqr-2cq5", "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/1a93532e665217b5d329808ca78e37e59e9f8a9d"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62709"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a65f6820-9cf2-3e24-ac89-4d7625a6e837", "product": {"name": "clipbucket-v5"}, "product_version": "5.5.2, < 5.5.2#162"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dbe8f17e-3359-3011-b1b2-69da361770a4", "vendor": {"name": "MacWarrior"}}], "isExploited": false}
