This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. The additional presence of a POP chain in the Contact Form 7 plugin, which is likely to be used alongside, allows attackers to delete arbitrary files, leading to a denial of service or remote code execution when the wp-config.php file is deleted.", "datePublished": "2025-07-19T04:23:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-21T16:54:12", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6980112b-a555-47a4-b2d7-f0187d52fc63?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/integration-for-contact-form-7-and-pipedrive/tags/1.2.3/integration-for-contact-form-7-and-pipedrive.php#L953", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/integration-for-contact-form-7-and-pipedrive/#developers", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3329002/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7696"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cf055976-99e5-3590-b412-a9e46eb740f6", "product": {"name": "Integration for Pipedrive and Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor, Ninja Forms"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eceb2877-d00f-3b4e-9dc7-39c445ea6cf0", "vendor": {"name": "crmperks"}}], "isExploited": false}
