This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-05-17T05:30:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-19T15:40:17", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/8fe1609d-17d6-4afe-90b2-5473dc9b6c3b?source=cve", "https://www.wpbot.pro/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3812"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3812"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "50f3b77c-394e-3936-b183-ecfd72b75848", "product": {"name": "WPBot Pro Wordpress Chatbot"}, "product_version": "* \u226413.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "01ccf64f-d6f6-3efe-a822-00bdbfb1093a", "vendor": {"name": "QuantumCloud"}}], "isExploited": false}
