So pl->phydev->lock needs to be\nacquired prior to pl->state_mutex. But that requires dereferencing\npl->phydev in the first place, and without pl->state_mutex, that is\nracy.\n\nHence the reason for the extra lock. Currently it is redundant, but it\nwill serve a functional purpose once mutex_lock(&phy->lock) will be\nmoved outside of the mutex_lock(&pl->state_mutex) section.\n\nAnother alternative considered would have been to let phylink_resolve()\nacquire the rtnl_mutex, which is also held when phylink_bringup_phy()\nand phylink_disconnect_phy() are called. But since phylink_disconnect_phy()\nruns under rtnl_lock(), it would deadlock with phylink_resolve() when\ncalling flush_work(&pl->resolve). Additionally, it would have been\nundesirable because it would have unnecessarily blocked many other call\npaths as well in the entire kernel, so the smaller-scoped lock was\npreferred.", "datePublished": "2025-10-01T09:30:25", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T21:31:33", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39905", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0ba5b2f2c381dbec9ed9e4ab3ae5d3e667de0dc3", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56fe63b05ec84ae6674269d78397cec43a7a295a"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-39905", "GHSA-3w4m-c8rq-62jj"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b6d0180-986a-3b9c-8844-3b771f6f37ed", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <0ba5b2f2c381dbec9ed9e4ab3ae5d3e667de0dc3"}, {"id": "1026b0e7-ebb9-3814-913b-6006a0a7fb2e", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <56fe63b05ec84ae6674269d78397cec43a7a295a"}, {"id": "33e26b47-3746-3a5c-ac66-a6a063f0e2be", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16.8"}, {"id": "f6c0abe1-8371-331c-8ac2-e6f1a1e11ff6", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8dc7942c-f1ce-30aa-aa47-4da462cf24cc", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
