A data leak vulnerability affects sites deployed between commits 10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510 and 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b. On login-required sites, the leak meant that some content on the site's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users. Only login-required sites that got deployed during this timeframe are affected, roughly between April 30 2025 noon EDT and May 2 2025, noon EDT. Sites on the stable branch are unaffected. Private content on an instance's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites. Versions of 3.5.0.beta4 after commit 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b are not vulnerable to the issue. No workarounds are available. Sites must upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of Discourse.", "datePublished": "2025-05-05T20:03:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-06T13:44:48", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-v3h7-c287-pfg9", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510", "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-46813"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "21bc4d05-f446-3b56-89a0-9914706e07f7", "product": {"name": "discourse"}, "product_version": "10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510, \u2264 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f46fa1d6-d125-3531-b075-39f2f0b48899", "vendor": {"name": "discourse"}}], "isExploited": false}
