However the origin was not correctly inferred in some cases. When combined with an open redirector vulnerability on a trusted site, this could allow a malicious site to initiate a download whose origin in the file select dialog appears as the trusted site which initiated the redirect.", "datePublished": "2025-01-21T04:26:10", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-22T14:00:42", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/2888770"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-23086"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1223e63b-305b-35fe-ac0d-fbada9a48fb9", "product": {"name": "Desktop Browser"}, "product_version": "1.74.48 <1.74.48"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "96e563b5-fdc5-3545-bcfc-2d8c13f7ad94", "vendor": {"name": "Brave"}}], "isExploited": false}
