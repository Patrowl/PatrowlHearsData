Affected by this vulnerability is the function amf_nsmf_pdusession_handle_update_sm_context of the file src/amf/nsmf-handler.c of the component AMF. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The attack can be launched remotely. This vulnerability allows a single UE to crash the AMF, resulting in the complete loss of mobility and session management services and causing a network-wide outage. All registered UEs will lose connectivity, and new registrations will be blocked until the AMF is restarted, leading to a high availability impact. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.", "datePublished": "2025-03-04T13:09:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-04T14:18:52", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://vuldb.com/?id.298513", "https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.298513", "https://vuldb.com/?submit.506038", "https://github.com/guoweifk/BugReport/blob/main/Open5GS%20AMF%20Denial%20of%20Service%20via%20PDU%20Session%20ID%20Conflict", "https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/pull/3711"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-1925"], "assigner": "VulDB", "epss": 0.72, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a057f37b-9101-3b56-aa31-92a75479b27e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
