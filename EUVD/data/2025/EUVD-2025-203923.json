This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user-supplied YouTube video URLs in the `um_profile_field_filter_hook__youtube_video()` function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute whenever a user accesses the injected user's profile page.", "datePublished": "2025-12-17T21:30:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-17T21:30:48", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/876b57e0-cf1e-4ce9-ba85-a5d4554797bd?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ultimate-member/trunk/includes/core/um-filters-fields.php#L80", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3421362/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13217"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13217"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bca44e96-854f-3df4-8cdf-3a1f0ac2cfe8", "product": {"name": "Ultimate Member \u2013 User Profile, Registration, Login, Member Directory, Content Restriction & Membership Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.11.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2a64aa0e-bac6-3bb4-a8e6-a5a17500ad20", "vendor": {"name": "ultimatemember"}}], "isExploited": false}
