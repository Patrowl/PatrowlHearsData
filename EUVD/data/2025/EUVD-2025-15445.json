In versions up to and including 0.4.2rc1, `concat()` may skip evaluation of side effects when the length of an argument is zero. This is due to a fastpath in the implementation which skips evaluation of argument expressions when their length is zero. In practice, it would be very unusual in user code to construct zero-length bytestrings using an expression with side-effects, since zero-length bytestrings are typically constructed with the empty literal `b\"\"`; the only way to construct an empty bytestring which has side effects would be with the ternary operator introduced in v0.3.8, e.g. `b\"\" if self.do_some_side_effect() else b\"\"`. The fix is available in pull request 4644 and expected to be part of the 0.4.2 release. As a workaround, don't have side effects in expressions which construct zero-length bytestrings.", "datePublished": "2025-05-15T17:24:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-15T18:37:33", "baseScore": 2.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-qhr6-mgqr-mchm", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-47285", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/4644", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper", "https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/68b68c4b30c5ef2f312b4674676170b8a6eaa316/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L560-L562"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-47285", "GHSA-qhr6-mgqr-mchm"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e021bdc5-1294-3397-b11a-8e2d199a82d2", "product": {"name": "vyper"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.4.2rc1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "263a0b08-f1df-3545-9f26-54f5168d0c42", "vendor": {"name": "vyperlang"}}], "isExploited": false}
