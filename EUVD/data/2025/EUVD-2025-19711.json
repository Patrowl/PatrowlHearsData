This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include arbitrary file paths in a form submission. The file will be deleted when the form submission is deleted, whether by an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings. This can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-07-02T04:24:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-02T13:17:02", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6dc9b4cb-d36b-4693-a7b9-1dad123b6639?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/forminator/trunk/library/model/class-form-entry-model.php#L1249", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3319860/forminator#file3"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6463"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "71eb0f59-7672-32c9-b978-2040a53d9b66", "product": {"name": "Forminator Forms \u2013 Contact Form, Payment Form & Custom Form Builder"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.44.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b3c17110-dfd2-3edb-b888-31938d456f78", "vendor": {"name": "wpmudev"}}], "isExploited": false}
