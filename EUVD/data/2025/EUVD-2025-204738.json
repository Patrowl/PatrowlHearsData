The Admin CLI command used to configure Certificate access to the initial startup of the container sets a property of \"allowany\" to allow any user with a valid and trusted client auth certificate to connect. Admins can then set more restricted access to specific certificates. A logic error caused this admin CLI command to be run on each restart of the container instead of only the first startup as intended resetting the configuration to \"allowany\".", "datePublished": "2025-12-22T21:30:33", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-22T21:30:33", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://support.keyfactor.com/hc/en-us/articles/33997706776987-SignServer-security-advisory-Container-vulnerability-CVE-2025-26787-fixed-in-version-7-2", "https://docs.keyfactor.com/signserver/latest/signserver-7-2-release-notes", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26787"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-26787"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1423fea6-9d6c-3702-9472-548409be663e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a3e28ea3-cb07-35c7-8fba-dee3b2ffec00", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
