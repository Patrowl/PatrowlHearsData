The issue occurs due to unchecked multiplication of image dimensions, such as width, height, and bytes-per-pixel (img_bpp), which can result in allocating insufficient memory and subsequently performing out-of-bounds writes. This issue could lead to heap corruption, a potential denial of service (DoS), or arbitrary code execution in certain scenarios.", "datePublished": "2025-06-13T15:21:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-01T07:31:43", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6035", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2372515", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6035", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/10/msg00022.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6035"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a13da074-d109-3232-ac9a-c919c74ea9aa", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
