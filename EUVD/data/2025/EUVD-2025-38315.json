Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-11-10T21:58:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-19T00:12:35", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/security/advisories/GHSA-wf5f-4jwr-ppcp", "https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/commit/b808ee05dd7f0c8ea8ec34bdf394d40e63501086", "https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64512", "https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/releases/tag/20251107", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/11/msg00017.html"], "aliases": ["GHSA-wf5f-4jwr-ppcp", "CVE-2025-64512"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aa72484a-3ee2-326e-8e12-13e6718f5706", "product": {"name": "pdfminer.six"}, "product_version": "< 20251107"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "84204232-35ae-3188-bbc1-8e0fa8ffa390", "vendor": {"name": "pdfminer"}}], "isExploited": false}
