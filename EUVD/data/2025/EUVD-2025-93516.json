Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated user combined with a low complexity attack may enable escalation of privilege. This result may potentially occur via network access when attack requirements are present without special internal knowledge and requires no user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (high), integrity (high) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T16:49:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-13T04:55:19", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01328.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24838"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24838"], "assigner": "intel", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a8865506-218d-3e66-ac47-745cc62f9baa", "product": {"name": "Intel(R) CIP software"}, "product_version": "before version WIN_DCA_2.4.0.11001"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26e8afe0-e88b-37b8-b89f-832e7f603888", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
