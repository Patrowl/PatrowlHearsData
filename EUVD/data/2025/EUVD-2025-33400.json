It's contents will be added to the Junos configuration of the device without being visible. This allows for the addition of any configuration unknown \n\nto the actual operator,\u00a0which includes users, IP addresses and other configuration which could allow unauthorized access to the device.\nThis exploit is persistent across reboots and even zeroization.\n\nThe indicator of compromise is a modified /etc/config/<platform>-defaults[-flex].conf file. Review that file for unexpected configuration statements, or compare it to an unmodified version which can be\u00a0extracted from the original Juniper software image file. For details on the extraction procedure please contact Juniper Technical Assistance Center (JTAC).\n\nTo restore the device to a trusted initial configuration the system needs to be reinstalled from physical media.\u00a0\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS on EX4600 Series and QFX5000 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3.", "datePublished": "2025-10-09T15:43:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-09T19:49:29", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://supportportal.juniper.net/JSA103146", "https://supportportal.juniper.net/s/article/EX-QFX-Procedure-to-format-install-QFX5K-device-using-a-USB", "https://support.juniper.net/support/requesting-support/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59957"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59957"], "assigner": "juniper", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "30222baf-1a7c-3b52-b917-137c20863be2", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "0 <21.4R3"}, {"id": "c20fe008-03fe-3ca1-8860-a7fc6707893d", "product": {"name": "Junos OS"}, "product_version": "22.2 <22.2R3-S3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4c25ef6-9876-31e5-b401-6e65ef365270", "vendor": {"name": "Juniper Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
