Abuse of this behavior could result in the execution of custom code on the server or unauthorized access to application configuration data. This issue affects only the ScreenConnect server component; host and guest clients are not impacted. ScreenConnect 25.8 introduces enhanced server-side configuration handling and integrity checks to ensure only trusted extensions can be installed.", "datePublished": "2025-12-11T14:21:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T04:55:50", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/screenconnect-2025.8-security-patch", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14265"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14265"], "assigner": "ConnectWise", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1d9054fe-1675-3bfa-b99e-a35296aaed32", "product": {"name": "ScreenConnect"}, "product_version": "All versions prior to 2025.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b489250-a90b-37ca-8bc3-ae0f2eeadeab", "vendor": {"name": "ConnectWise"}}], "isExploited": false}
