Prior to version 0.6.12, a vulnerability was identified in the DIFY where normal users are improperly granted permissions to edit APP names, descriptions and icons. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to modify app details, despite being restricted from viewing apps, which poses a security risk to the integrity of the application. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can modify app details.", "datePublished": "2025-04-18T16:05:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-18T16:37:49", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/langgenius/dify/security/advisories/GHSA-gg5w-m2vw-vmmj", "https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5266"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32795"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f3a48235-d564-30d5-b23c-637fda9d7034", "product": {"name": "dify"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c2712b9b-8e3f-32b0-8a8b-a7c1f4187d45", "vendor": {"name": "langgenius"}}], "isExploited": false}
