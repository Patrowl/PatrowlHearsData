In versions 2.8.11 and below, the MySQLWriteTool executes arbitrary SQL provided by the caller using PDO::prepare() + execute() without semantic restrictions. This is consistent with the name (\u201cwrite tool\u201d), but in an LLM/agent context it becomes a high-risk capability: prompt injection or indirect prompt manipulation can cause execution of destructive queries such as DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, DELETE, ALTER, or privilege-related statements (subject to DB permissions). Deployments that expose an agent with MySQLWriteTool enabled to untrusted input and/or run the tool with a DB user that has broad privileges are impacted. This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12.", "datePublished": "2025-12-10T22:55:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-11T15:37:39", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-898v-775g-777c", "https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai", "https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/commit/44bab85d92bf162898ee48d0bcef6ba0d29b59c9", "https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/releases/tag/2.8.12", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67510"], "aliases": ["GHSA-898v-775g-777c", "CVE-2025-67510"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "62403507-fa4a-3144-9588-c52c54709fe5", "product": {"name": "neuron-ai"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cbd22e03-75d9-343e-ba5c-3cd2e99713d6", "vendor": {"name": "neuron-core"}}], "isExploited": false}
