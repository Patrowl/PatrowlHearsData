Cherry Studio registers a custom protocol called `cherrystudio://`. When handling the MCP installation URL, it parses the base64-encoded configuration data and directly executes the command within it. In the files `src/main/services/ProtocolClient.ts` and `src/main/services/urlschema/mcp-install.ts`, when receiving a URL of the `cherrystudio://mcp` type, the `handleMcpProtocolUrl` function is called for processing. If an attacker crafts malicious content and posts it on a website or elsewhere (there are many exploitation methods, such as creating a malicious website with a button containing this malicious content), when the user clicks it, since the pop-up window contains normal content, the direct click is considered a scene action, and the malicious command is directly triggered, leading to the user being compromised. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.", "datePublished": "2025-10-10T19:50:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-10T20:46:08", "baseScore": 9.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/security/advisories/GHSA-hh6w-rmjc-26f6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-61929"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4894b962-1b5a-372e-96de-56918b02f855", "product": {"name": "cherry-studio"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.7.0-alpha.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a3fb900f-98cb-39b5-8186-2ac7f4e4b4ce", "vendor": {"name": "CherryHQ"}}], "isExploited": false}
