A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Classic Web Client due to insufficient sanitization of HTML content in ICS files. When a user views an e-mail message containing a malicious ICS entry, its embedded JavaScript executes via an ontoggle event inside a <details> tag. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript within the victim's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as setting e-mail filters to redirect messages to an attacker-controlled address. As a result, an attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the victim's account, including e-mail redirection and data exfiltration.", "datePublished": "2025-03-12T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-21T22:55:23", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Security_Center", "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.1.5#Security_Fixes", "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/10.0.13#Security_Fixes", "https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_Releases/9.0.0/P44#Security_Fixes", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27915", "https://strikeready.com/blog/0day-ics-attack-in-the-wild", "https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2025-27915"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27915"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 29.36, "exploitedSince": "2025-10-07T00:00:00", "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "63f0e45b-b899-3144-91d2-264822dcf37f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "92dad9d3-a214-33fd-bb4c-d6c88b7284b5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": true}
