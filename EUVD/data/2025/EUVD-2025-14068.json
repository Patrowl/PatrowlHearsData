This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like password and email through the edit_profile_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user's email addresses and passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-05-09T01:42:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-09T03:42:51", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/54f1ebfb-67f1-461d-91f1-269b0a2c0653?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3278939/wpbookit/trunk/core/admin/classes/controllers/class.wpb-profile-controller.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3810"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3810"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ec651dac-2ca0-3523-ae73-5dae0eabd208", "product": {"name": "WPBookit"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa75055a-bedf-385f-a905-44d150b29046", "vendor": {"name": "iqonicdesign"}}], "isExploited": false}
