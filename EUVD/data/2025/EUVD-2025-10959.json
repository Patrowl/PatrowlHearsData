The code uses the yauzl library for reading the archive. The yauzl library does not contain any mechanism to detect or prevent extraction of a  Zip Bomb https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb . Therefore, when using the User Import functionality with a Zip Bomb, PeerTube will try extracting the archive which will cause a disk space resource exhaustion.", "datePublished": "2025-04-15T15:30:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-15T15:30:54", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/releases/tag/v7.1.1", "https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/peertube-archive-resource-exhaustion/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32949"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32949"], "assigner": "JFROG", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [], "isExploited": false}
