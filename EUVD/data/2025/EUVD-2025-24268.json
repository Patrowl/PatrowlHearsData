Prior to commit dea1e16, a malicious package can introduce arbitrary JavaScript code into the Hydra database that is automatically evaluated in a client's browser when anyone visits the build page. This could be done by a third-party project as part of its build process. This also happens in other places like with hydra-release-name. This issue has been patched by commit dea1e16. A workaround involves either not building untrusted packages or not visiting the builds page.", "datePublished": "2025-08-12T15:47:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-12T15:57:41", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/security/advisories/GHSA-7qwg-q53v-vh99", "https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/commit/dea1e168f590efb27db32dbacc82b09e15f8ae4b"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54800"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "41d3cceb-2dbc-32e7-bdff-55a3c58d4f94", "product": {"name": "hydra"}, "product_version": "< dea1e168f590efb27db32dbacc82b09e15f8ae4b"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "31837f23-a5b0-3a51-8a6b-3b708766bdd7", "vendor": {"name": "NixOS"}}], "isExploited": false}
