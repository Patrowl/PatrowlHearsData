This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to redirect legitimate users to malicious websites, potentially leading to phishing attacks or the delivery of exploit kits.\n\nOpen Redirection via returnUrl\u00a0Parameter: An Open Redirection vulnerability exists in the /s/action/unlock/user.user/0\u00a0endpoint. The returnUrl\u00a0parameter, intended for post-action redirection, is not properly validated. This allows an attacker to craft a URL that, when clicked by a user, redirects them to an arbitrary external website controlled by the attacker.\n\nMitigationUpdate Mautic to a version that properly validates or sanitizes the returnUrl\u00a0parameter to ensure that redirects only occur to trusted, internal URLs or explicitly whitelisted domains.", "datePublished": "2025-05-28T17:47:05", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-28T17:57:39", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-6vx9-9r2g-8373", "https://github.com/mautic/mautic"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5256", "GHSA-6vx9-9r2g-8373"], "assigner": "Mautic", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2c6f85d9-f473-3617-ac05-62d7e80e9885", "product": {"name": "Mautic"}, "product_version": "> 1.0.0 << 6.0.2, < 5.2.6, < 4.4.16"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c98c294e-4899-3ab3-80ee-d3cd91107946", "vendor": {"name": "Mautic"}}], "isExploited": false}
