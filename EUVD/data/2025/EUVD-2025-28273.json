Prior to version 4.9.0, pycares is vulnerable to a use-after-free condition that occurs when a Channel object is garbage collected while DNS queries are still pending. This results in a fatal Python error and interpreter crash. The vulnerability has been fixed in pycares 4.9.0 by implementing a safe channel destruction mechanism.", "datePublished": "2025-06-20T19:14:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-20T20:06:23", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/saghul/pycares/security/advisories/GHSA-5qpg-rh4j-qp35", "https://github.com/saghul/pycares/security/advisories/GHSA-5qpg-rh4j-qp35", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiodns/commit/f259a6e3650555157af53ac2b39f2ff545321d55", "https://github.com/saghul/pycares/commit/ebfd7d71eb8e74bc1057a361ea79a5906db510d4", "https://github.com/aio-libs/aiodns/releases/tag/v3.5.0", "https://github.com/saghul/pycares/releases/tag/v4.9.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48945"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0f8a43bf-b4d5-365c-9e9f-7cacc4f50e25", "product": {"name": "aiodns"}, "product_version": "< 4.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f8e46d86-be44-376d-b743-afa1f07db63c", "vendor": {"name": "aio-libs"}}], "isExploited": false}
