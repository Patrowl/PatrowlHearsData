This allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious executable in a predictable location such as C:\\Program.exe. If the service runs with elevated privileges, exploitation results in privilege escalation to SYSTEM level. This vulnerability arises from an unquoted service path affecting systems where the executable resides in a path containing spaces.\nAffected products and versions include: ABP 2.0.7.6130 and earlier as well as AES 1.0.6.6133 and earlier.", "datePublished": "2025-07-23T07:26:03", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-23T14:10:47", "baseScore": 9.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.asustor.com/security/security_advisory_detail?id=47"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-8070"], "assigner": "ASUSTOR1", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "888a8702-ed33-310e-b4c4-a6c2fa1fb652", "product": {"name": "ABP and AES"}, "product_version": "AES 1.0 \u22641.0.6.6133"}, {"id": "bbec7709-b902-3047-8efe-4e81d68926b3", "product": {"name": "ABP and AES"}, "product_version": "ABP 2.0 \u22642.0.7.6130"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fdc219d5-bf28-3113-9ed2-98636a6362fc", "vendor": {"name": "ASUSTOR"}}], "isExploited": false}
