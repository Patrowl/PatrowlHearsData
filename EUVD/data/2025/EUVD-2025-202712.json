Versions 0.23.1 mistakenly include an API endpoint that is intended for internal use by the SFTP software sftpgo, exposing it to the public-facing HTTP API for AzuraCast installations. A user with specific internal knowledge of a station's operations can craft a custom HTTP request that would affect the contents of a station's database, without revealing any internal information about the station. In order to carry out an attack, a malicious user would need to know a valid SFTP station username and the coordinating internal filesystem structure. This issue is fixed in version 0.23.2.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T06:53:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T20:39:38", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/security/advisories/GHSA-9449-rphm-mjqr", "https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast/commit/34620dbad93f6cd8e209a4220e3e53c7c5fea844", "https://github.com/AzuraCast/AzuraCast", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67737"], "aliases": ["GHSA-9449-rphm-mjqr", "CVE-2025-67737"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "09793253-f24e-38f1-a2bc-ac001e361496", "product": {"name": "AzuraCast"}, "product_version": "< 0.23.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b43bcb37-5522-3d26-84c2-e81ccdaa18da", "vendor": {"name": "azuracast"}}], "isExploited": false}
