Versions 2.8.11 and below use MySQLSelectTool, which is vulnerable to Read-Only Bypass.  MySQLSelectTool is intended to be a read-only SQL tool (e.g., for LLM agent querying, however, validation based on the first keyword (e.g., SELECT) and a forbidden-keyword list does not block file-writing constructs such as INTO OUTFILE / INTO DUMPFILE. As a result, an attacker who can influence the tool input (e.g., via prompt injection through a public agent endpoint) may write arbitrary files to the DB server if the MySQL/MariaDB account has the FILE privilege and server configuration permits writes to a useful location (e.g., a web-accessible directory). This issue is fixed in version 2.8.12.", "datePublished": "2025-12-10T23:05:22", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-11T15:37:08", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/security/advisories/GHSA-j8g6-5gqc-mq36", "https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai", "https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/commit/72735d0ea133266cf2f5d5d195d41e9dd865289a", "https://github.com/neuron-core/neuron-ai/releases/tag/2.8.12", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67509"], "aliases": ["GHSA-j8g6-5gqc-mq36", "CVE-2025-67509"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7513f750-531f-3abb-86db-e12f7579e4b6", "product": {"name": "neuron-ai"}, "product_version": "< 2.8.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d1e704ea-57c5-3983-9c2b-5dae71b7e405", "vendor": {"name": "neuron-core"}}], "isExploited": false}
