When the application is configured with authentication disabled (i.e., the \"Allow unknown devices\" option is enabled), the /api/executeScript endpoint is exposed without access control. This allows unauthenticated remote attackers to inject arbitrary AppleScript payloads via the X-Script HTTP header, resulting in code execution using do shell script. Successful exploitation grants attackers the ability to run arbitrary commands on the macOS host with the privileges of the Remote for Mac background process.", "datePublished": "2025-07-03T19:47:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-03T20:00:11", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/osx/http/remote_for_mac_rce.rb", "https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/osx/http/remote_for_mac_rce/", "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote-for-mac/id1086962925", "https://packetstorm.news/files/id/195347", "https://vulncheck.com/advisories/remote-for-mac-rce"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34089"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 56.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc946880-67d0-3425-b3cc-144021d397f1", "product": {"name": "Remote for Mac"}, "product_version": "* \u22642025.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "651f4541-55dd-37f3-a15d-39c47fc54360", "vendor": {"name": "Aexol Studio"}}], "isExploited": false}
