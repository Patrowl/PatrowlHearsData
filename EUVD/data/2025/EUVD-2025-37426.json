This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This requires the attacker have access to a defined third-party server as specified in the settings, so it is unlikely that this will be exploitable by contributor-level users, and more likely to be exploited by administrators who also have access to the plugin's settings.", "datePublished": "2025-11-01T06:40:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T13:30:29", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/99db7ac5-b7ac-4a4f-bd05-e563a3dfb839?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3384901%40restful-syndication&new=3384901%40restful-syndication&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12171"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12171"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "45bca218-dc62-386a-8a46-e2275dce628d", "product": {"name": "RESTful Content Syndication"}, "product_version": "1.1.0 \u22641.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e3366960-67f8-3317-9aec-80271f23beb8", "vendor": {"name": "anthonyeden"}}], "isExploited": false}
