{"id": "EUVD-2025-18083", "enisaUuid": "7b91e943-d25c-3082-a927-1f1afb374ddc", "description": "The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to lack of restriction on the directory a file can be deleted from in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php). This vulnerability can be paired with CVE-2025-4798 to delete any file within the WordPress root directory.", "datePublished": "2025-06-11T03:41:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-11T13:23:50", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f9d9e485-171f-4e36-943d-397d540e31f4?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-options.php#L16", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-options.php#L42", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-downloadmanager/trunk/download-manager.php#L215", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3294467/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4799"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-4799"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 1.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f77150a0-c84c-3173-ab4e-94b68025115e", "product": {"name": "WP-DownloadManager"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.68.10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8b21b6e7-53f1-368f-bae6-c35f543974ec", "vendor": {"name": "GamerZ"}}], "isExploited": false}
