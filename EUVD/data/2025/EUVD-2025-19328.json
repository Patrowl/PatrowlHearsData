Prior to version 6.6.13, a critical Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the `/api/v2/Photo::fromUrl` endpoint. This flaw lets an attacker instruct the application\u2019s backend to make HTTP requests to any URL they choose. Consequently, internal network resources\u2014such as localhost services or cloud-provider metadata endpoints\u2014become reachable. The endpoint takes a URL from the user and calls it server-side via fopen() without any safeguards. There is no IP address validation, nor are there any allow-list, timeout, or size restrictions. Because of this, attackers can point the application at internal targets. Using this flaw, an attacker can perform internal port scans or retrieve sensitive cloud metadata. Version 6.6.13 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-06-27T13:00:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-27T13:58:56", "baseScore": 3.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/security/advisories/GHSA-cpgw-wgf3-xc6v", "https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee/commit/9dc162eefe56ce185ac1d59da42ee557933d914d"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53018"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b27cb519-d174-3c06-b93e-48e64e839a44", "product": {"name": "Lychee"}, "product_version": "< 6.6.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4c7aa3c7-bf73-3e6a-9f9e-7f7011a8eec1", "vendor": {"name": "LycheeOrg"}}], "isExploited": false}
