Prior to commit e6b4271, a command injection vulnerability was discovered in the discussion-to-slack.yml GitHub Actions workflow. Untrusted discussion fields (title, body, etc.) were directly interpolated into shell commands in a run: block. An attacker could craft a malicious GitHub Discussion title or body (e.g., $(curl ...)) to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Actions runner. This issue has been fixed in commit e6b4271 where the discussion-to-slack.yml workflow was removed. Users should remove the discussion-to-slack.yml workflow if using a fork or derivative of this repository.", "datePublished": "2025-07-01T18:17:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-01T18:17:01", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-432r-9455-7f9x", "https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/commit/e6b427150b35e97a089ea10409de8c5c52f8a7b9"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-53104"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "851b8879-4707-3cf1-a66e-9425ae1ec1ed", "product": {"name": "gluestack-ui"}, "product_version": "< e6b4271"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2b78dfa6-7e1c-3c63-a414-f38dadb160af", "vendor": {"name": "gluestack"}}], "isExploited": false}
