NVMS-9000 firmware (used by many white-labeled DVR/NVR/IPC products) contains hardcoded API credentials and an OS command injection flaw in its configuration services. The web/API interface accepts HTTP/XML requests authenticated with a fixed vendor credential string and passes user-controlled fields into shell execution contexts without proper argument sanitization. An unauthenticated remote attacker can leverage the hard-coded credential to access endpoints such as /editBlackAndWhiteList and inject shell metacharacters inside XML parameters, resulting in arbitrary command execution as root. The same vulnerable backend is also reachable in some models through a proprietary TCP service on port 4567 that accepts a magic GUID preface and base64-encoded XML, enabling the same command injection sink. Firmware releases from mid-February 2018 and later are reported to have addressed this issue.\u00a0Exploitation evidence was observed by the Shadowserver Foundation on 2025-01-28 UTC.", "datePublished": "2025-11-24T20:30:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-25T13:06:45", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25126", "https://blogs.juniper.net/en-us/threat-research/iot-botnet-exploiting-tvt-shenzhen-dvrs-still-lingers", "https://github.com/mcw0/PoC/blob/master/TVT_and_OEM_IPC_NVR_DVR_RCE_Backdoor_and_Information_Disclosure.txt", "https://qkl.seebug.org/vuldb/ssvid-97217", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180614014914/http://en.tvt.net.cn:80/news/227.html", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/tvt-nvms9000-hardcoded-api-credentials-and-command-injection"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-25126", "GHSA-54fc-5f6v-pcx6"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 1.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dd1c7b77-62ef-3172-a89b-d371e8486127", "product": {"name": "NVMS-9000"}, "product_version": "0 <mid-February firmware builds"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "462dac82-70b7-3031-9d55-a4958a29f59e", "vendor": {"name": "Shenzhen TVT Digital Technology Co., Ltd."}}], "isExploited": false}
