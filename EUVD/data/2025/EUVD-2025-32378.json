It can also be 0, if there\nis no owner of the other page half, and xdp_do_redirect() for this\nbuffer ran so far that it triggered a flush of the devmap/cpumap bulk\nqueue, and the consumers of those bulk queues also freed the buffer,\nall by the time xdp_do_redirect() returns the execution back to enetc.\n\nThis is the reason why enetc_flip_rx_buff() is called before\nxdp_do_redirect(), but there is a big flaw with that reasoning:\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() will set rx_swbd->page = NULL on both sides of the\nenetc_page_reusable() branch, and if xdp_do_redirect() returns an error,\nwe call enetc_xdp_free(), which does not deal gracefully with that.\n\nIn fact, what happens is quite special. The page refcounts start as 1.\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() figures they're reusable, transfers these\nrx_swbd->page pointers to a different rx_swbd in enetc_reuse_page(), and\nbumps the refcount to 2. When xdp_do_redirect() later returns an error,\nwe call the no-op enetc_xdp_free(), but we still haven't lost the\nreference to that page. A copy of it is still at rx_ring->next_to_alloc,\nbut that has refcount 2 (and there are no concurrent owners of it in\nflight, to drop the refcount). What really kills the system is when\nwe'll flip the rx_swbd->page the second time around. With an updated\nrefcount of 2, the page will not be reusable and we'll really leak it.\nThen enetc_new_page() will have to allocate more pages, which will then\neventually leak again on further errors from xdp_do_redirect().\n\nThe problem, summarized, is that we zeroize rx_swbd->page before we're\ncompletely done with it, and this makes it impossible for the error path\nto do something with it.\n\nSince the packet is potentially multi-buffer and therefore the\nrx_swbd->page is potentially an array, manual passing of the old\npointers between enetc_flip_rx_buff() and enetc_xdp_free() is a bit\ndifficult.\n\nFor the sake of going with a simple solution, we accept the possibility\nof racing with xdp_do_redirect(), and we move the flip procedure to\nexecute only on the redirect success path. By racing, I mean that the\npage may be deemed as not reusable by enetc (having a refcount of 0),\nbut there will be no leak in that case, either.\n\nOnce we accept that, we have something better to do with buffers on\nXDP_REDIRECT failure. Since we haven't performed half-page flipping yet,\nwe won't, either (and this way, we can avoid enetc_xdp_free()\ncompletely, which gives the entire page to the slab allocator).\nInstead, we'll call enetc_xdp_drop(), which will recycle this half of\nthe buffer back to the RX ring.", "datePublished": "2025-10-04T15:16:41", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-04T15:16:41", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-50483", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/306526331e7a37e714e11ab7c6d73eb004745224", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/628050ec952d2e2e46ec9fb6aa07e41139e030c8", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7fba523b51ccce5f7981f8a43ad84d664da68131", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bcf2c1dc5358dcf7e34a68cdb6b0bbf967801efa"], "aliases": ["CVE-2022-50483", "GHSA-3xm2-jm9m-87r6"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0613e1b9-fd17-325a-9292-5378dea709ad", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9d2b68cc108db2fdb35022ed2d88cfb305c441a6 <306526331e7a37e714e11ab7c6d73eb004745224"}, {"id": "1fabee95-130c-39fd-b51e-a240d572ca45", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.0.16"}, {"id": "530cb4ab-f0ac-34da-b35f-60a2ca718227", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9d2b68cc108db2fdb35022ed2d88cfb305c441a6 <628050ec952d2e2e46ec9fb6aa07e41139e030c8"}, {"id": "6bdd6480-4978-3204-9fe7-68038a8f0e77", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.15.86"}, {"id": "6d2cd549-1af7-33f2-a64a-db097b7de95a", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "5.13"}, {"id": "8a507810-c477-30c7-be9e-518c9257097c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "bd79b7e3-afe8-31cb-9f9c-5ba5582d4eaf", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9d2b68cc108db2fdb35022ed2d88cfb305c441a6 <bcf2c1dc5358dcf7e34a68cdb6b0bbf967801efa"}, {"id": "d48e7fdc-4d40-3619-9777-6c6b8a5011e1", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "9d2b68cc108db2fdb35022ed2d88cfb305c441a6 <7fba523b51ccce5f7981f8a43ad84d664da68131"}, {"id": "dd8c39c7-6faf-3593-ab3e-fab374926038", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1.2"}, {"id": "e79fe5f5-d7c5-355b-8d6c-61eec588515f", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75186f45-98f2-39e6-ab25-5c41c6a2fed4", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
