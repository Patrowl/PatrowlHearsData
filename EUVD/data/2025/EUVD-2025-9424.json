Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was\non SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the\ntask may be on SCX but no longer runnable.\n\nThis could lead to a non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()\nwhich cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode\nis the task ending up with (!on_rq && on_cpu) state which can cause\npotential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.\n\nFix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set. This makes\n@prev_on_scx only used in one place.
