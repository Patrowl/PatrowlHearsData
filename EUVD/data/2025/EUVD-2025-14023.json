A malicious project assigned as a node owner can provide a path to any local file (readable by ironic-conductor), which may then be written to the target node disk. This is difficult to exploit in practice, because a node deployed in this manner should never reach the ACTIVE state, but it still represents a danger in environments running with non-default, insecure configurations such as with automated cleaning disabled. The fixed versions are 24.1.3, 26.1.1, and 29.0.1.", "datePublished": "2025-05-08T17:16:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-13T04:24:03", "baseScore": 2.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/2107847", "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2025-001.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-44021", "https://github.com/openstack/ironic/commit/10590b36f541130f6a5d7a49da0f095ff8390cce", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/ironic/PYSEC-2025-38.yaml", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/08/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-44021"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9b9e902e-1395-3308-b05b-3fba26e41c35", "product": {"name": "Ironic"}, "product_version": "24 <24.1.3"}, {"id": "ab329f80-2538-3d9a-9d8a-8cbb6d84aafc", "product": {"name": "Ironic"}, "product_version": "25 <26.1.1"}, {"id": "ca602c0d-aaf2-37ff-b6c9-ab4edf925e8c", "product": {"name": "Ironic"}, "product_version": "27 <29.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "36d4a5a3-21ec-381a-bac9-d0dcfa1b00f7", "vendor": {"name": "OpenStack"}}], "isExploited": false}
