This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts. Note: This can only be exploited unauthenticated if the attacker knows which page contains the 'truelysell_edit_staff' shortcode.", "datePublished": "2025-10-16T06:47:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-16T15:37:17", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a636e865-9556-4afb-8726-4537a160f379?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/truelysell-service-booking-wordpress-theme/43398124", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10742"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10742"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ddbbe95-2b1d-3aca-b4bc-c380659e290e", "product": {"name": "Truelysell Core"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "216a03ad-7c45-3e1c-b9fa-982f3d7f2cbe", "vendor": {"name": "dreamstechnologies"}}], "isExploited": false}
