Prior to 0.6.0, the project's provided HTTP client's local JWK Set cache should do a full replacement when the goroutine refreshes the remote JWK Set. The current behavior is to overwrite or append. This is a security issue for use cases that utilize the provided auto-caching HTTP client and where key removal from a JWK Set is equivalent to revocation. The affected auto-caching HTTP client was added in version v0.5.0 and fixed in v0.6.0. The only workaround would be to remove the provided auto-caching HTTP client and replace it with a custom implementation. This involves setting the HTTPClientStorageOptions.RefreshInterval to zero (or not specifying the value).", "datePublished": "2025-01-09T17:22:59", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-09T18:09:01", "baseScore": 2.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:H/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/security/advisories/GHSA-675f-rq2r-jw82", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22149", "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/issues/40", "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/pull/41", "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset/commit/01db49a90f7f20c7fb39a699a2f19a7a5f379ed3", "https://github.com/MicahParks/jwkset"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-22149", "GHSA-675f-rq2r-jw82"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10192252-49a9-32bc-ae19-55a1759285f3", "product": {"name": "jwkset"}, "product_version": "0.5.0, < 0.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b24a9761-29b4-3103-ab6c-fa677d2849e3", "vendor": {"name": "MicahParks"}}], "isExploited": false}
