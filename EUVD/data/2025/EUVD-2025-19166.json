An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious files on the affected system and then execute arbitrary code or obtain root privileges on the system.", "datePublished": "2025-06-25T16:29:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-25T12:26:24", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-unauth-rce-ZAd2GnJ6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20282"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9113286b-ed8a-3b88-92ce-752dbe4e33cf", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "3.4 Patch 1"}, {"id": "f81a2234-0aea-357b-bbf4-4d4d8488f305", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "3.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3c256bc5-e908-3799-b978-41c94618a987", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
