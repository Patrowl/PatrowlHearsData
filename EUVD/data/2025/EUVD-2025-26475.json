An integer overflow during temporary file creation leads to an out-of-bounds memory access, allowing an attacker to potentially perform path traversal or access private temporary file content by creating symbolic links. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to manipulate file paths and access unauthorized data. The core issue stems from insufficient validation of file path lengths during temporary file operations.", "datePublished": "2025-09-03T01:52:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-03T15:44:33", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-7039", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2392423"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7039"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5c717083-c118-3218-a8c9-b9e555d2dc8b", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
