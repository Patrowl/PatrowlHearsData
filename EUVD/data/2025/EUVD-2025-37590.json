This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a payments status through server-side validation though the /wc-api/bp-payeer-gateway-callback endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update unpaid order statuses to paid resulting in a loss of revenue.", "datePublished": "2025-11-04T04:27:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T04:27:16", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11890", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/crypto-payment-gateway-with-payeer-for-woocommerce", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/43ca1393-637d-48e2-84f3-a06a4f0d83d1?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/crypto-payment-gateway-with-payeer-for-woocommerce/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11890", "GHSA-grcx-5pw5-xxrw"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c7b12ff4-a8eb-3456-8a6a-4214a41caae9", "product": {"name": "Crypto Payment Gateway with Payeer for WooCommerce"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "245b0780-7141-370a-9e5e-3429e8654d21", "vendor": {"name": "beycanpress"}}], "isExploited": false}
