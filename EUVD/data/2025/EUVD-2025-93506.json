Unprivileged software adversary with an authenticated user combined with a low complexity attack may enable denial of service. This result may potentially occur via local access when attack requirements are not present without special internal knowledge and requires passive user interaction. The potential vulnerability may impact the confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (high) of the vulnerable system, resulting in subsequent system confidentiality (none), integrity (none) and availability (none) impacts.", "datePublished": "2025-11-11T16:50:15", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-12T20:00:50", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01304.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26405"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-26405"], "assigner": "intel", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7103a8ba-0f9e-3612-8330-89a8de99afb6", "product": {"name": "Intel(R) NPU Drivers"}, "product_version": "See references"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "003e7f47-3fe6-3ae3-9546-a36a1a20fb0b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
