A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images.", "datePublished": "2025-03-17T21:32:37", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-04T22:02:39", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-265r-hfxg-fhmg", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1a43cb6a1035441f9aca8f5666a9b3ef9e70ab20", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cf158e884cfe4812a6c371b59e4ea9bc4c46e51a", "https://github.com/containerd/containerd", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-40635", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00005.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-40635", "GHSA-265r-hfxg-fhmg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13783466-edde-3a92-91cc-3283bc04e1ef", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "2.0.0-beta.0, < 2.0.4"}, {"id": "26912302-fb13-3abb-be03-98a691174708", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.38"}, {"id": "e47e4ebc-c2d8-3855-9a38-a61eccfca791", "product": {"name": "containerd"}, "product_version": "1.7.0-beta.0, < 1.7.27"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "89a634b5-dc74-37b0-aaff-7b84e0b7cfd8", "vendor": {"name": "containerd"}}], "isExploited": false}
