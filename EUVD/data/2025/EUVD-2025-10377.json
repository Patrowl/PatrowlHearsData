From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.", "datePublished": "2025-04-08T13:53:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-08T18:40:36", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-6hxc-62jh-p29v", "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/pull/821", "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/commit/29d38719112639d8c0ba910254a3dd4f482ea2d1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-31498"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e2b18133-db62-30ec-9011-ea48935b63ea", "product": {"name": "c-ares"}, "product_version": "1.32.3, < 1.34.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "28e4b3ce-2908-3967-b5a8-4e895aa2aa03", "vendor": {"name": "c-ares"}}], "isExploited": false}
