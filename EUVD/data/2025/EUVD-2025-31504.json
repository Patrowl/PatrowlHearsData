Unfortunately, if all active streams fail, then we\ntake the smallest value of { LONG_MAX, LONG_MAX, ... } as the value to set\nin wreq->transferred - which is then returned from ->write_iter().\n\nLONG_MAX was chosen as the initial value so that all the streams can be\nquickly assessed by taking the smallest value of all stream->transferred -\nbut this only works if we've set any of them.\n\nFix this by adding a flag to indicate whether the value in\nstream->transferred is valid and checking that when we integrate the\nvalues.  stream->transferred can then be initialised to zero.\n\nThis was found by running the generic/750 xfstest against cifs with\ncache=none.  It splices data to the target file.  Once (if) it has used up\nall the available scratch space, the writes start failing with ENOSPC.\nThis causes ->write_iter() to fail.  However, it was returning\nwreq->transferred, i.e. LONG_MAX, rather than an error (because it thought\nthe amount transferred was non-zero) and iter_file_splice_write() would\nthen try to clean up that amount of pipe bufferage - leading to an oops\nwhen it overran.  The kernel log showed:\n\n    CIFS: VFS: Send error in write = -28\n\nfollowed by:\n\n    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n\nwith:\n\n    RIP: 0010:iter_file_splice_write+0x3a4/0x520\n    do_splice+0x197/0x4e0\n\nor:\n\n    RIP: 0010:pipe_buf_release (include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h:282)\n    iter_file_splice_write (fs/splice.c:755)\n\nAlso put a warning check into splice to announce if ->write_iter() returned\nthat it had written more than it was asked to.", "datePublished": "2025-09-05T18:31:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-25T21:32:04", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f08c80af3c9a9849cd178b4843b7c01d103506a1", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/387164a2b97e1f5404c6d0049a7409bac7d2bc5b", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3de58b12ce074ec05b8741fa28d62ccb1070468", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-39723"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-39723"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1a140400-a428-36e2-9f34-f31987e7f2f4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.10"}, {"id": "401f4f51-225c-3882-9baf-28fe6a117e02", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "288ace2f57c9d06dd2e42bd80d03747d879a4068 <f08c80af3c9a9849cd178b4843b7c01d103506a1"}, {"id": "472d3637-b388-3787-8384-1ca28bc2921b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "9fc0ed26-cb50-3df8-a0c6-96653af40453", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16.4"}, {"id": "dfc36043-8db1-3502-98db-09a8d0e21f68", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17"}, {"id": "f1e1bd03-5e45-3c8f-b228-1c4f4e99163c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.44"}, {"id": "f953bb63-c48c-39d0-aa6a-69b7f81d69ab", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "288ace2f57c9d06dd2e42bd80d03747d879a4068 <a3de58b12ce074ec05b8741fa28d62ccb1070468"}, {"id": "ff43e398-01b7-382f-af4b-db2b4622c1dd", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "288ace2f57c9d06dd2e42bd80d03747d879a4068 <387164a2b97e1f5404c6d0049a7409bac7d2bc5b"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "44adac14-f519-39e4-99dd-15477c8a5858", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
