This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-10-08T03:31:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-08T14:20:09", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10494", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3369415%40motors-car-dealership-classified-listings%2Ftrunk&old=3367132%40motors-car-dealership-classified-listings%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/e6066890-75b9-468d-9f67-78e93f58dcc1?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10494", "GHSA-vq7p-fh8p-r62j"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ab14d13-4b93-3f2a-acea-ab88530f87bd", "product": {"name": "Motors \u2013 Car Dealership & Classified Listings Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.4.89"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e8539e5-8734-3c80-a872-21bd4ff605f4", "vendor": {"name": "stylemix"}}], "isExploited": false}
