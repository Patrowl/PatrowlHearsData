This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity or capability prior to updating their details like email in the 'Eventin\\Speaker\\Api\\SpeakerController::update_item' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-08-08T18:26:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-08T18:58:03", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9e0d441d-1da5-45e7-8a14-ce178099c0cc?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-event-solution/tags/4.0.28/core/speaker/Api/SpeakerController.php#L419", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3336972/wp-event-solution/trunk/core/speaker/Api/SpeakerController.php#file0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-4796"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fd27e41e-4ef2-3aa3-bfa8-0ae6f229831f", "product": {"name": "Eventin \u2013 Event Manager, Events Calendar, Booking, Tickets and Registration"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.0.34"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6c44a222-5c4d-3af2-9914-697fd6a54c5c", "vendor": {"name": "arraytics"}}], "isExploited": false}
