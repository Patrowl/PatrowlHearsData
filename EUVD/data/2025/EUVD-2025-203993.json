A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ChurchCRM versions 6.4.0 and prior that allows a low-privilege user with the \u201cManage Groups\u201d permission to inject persistent JavaScript into group role names. The payload is saved in the database and executed whenever any user (including administrators) views a page that displays that role, such as GroupView.php or PersonView.php. This allows full session hijacking and account takeover. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available.", "datePublished": "2025-12-17T21:18:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-18T15:08:55", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM/security/advisories/GHSA-j9gv-26c7-3qrh"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-67876"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a79cdd9-45a6-3fed-8495-62774e7bd225", "product": {"name": "crm"}, "product_version": "\u2264 6.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a2f1e59b-d6da-35f3-8df5-1d5b5117bb6c", "vendor": {"name": "ChurchCRM"}}], "isExploited": false}
