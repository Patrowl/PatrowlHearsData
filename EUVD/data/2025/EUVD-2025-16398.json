Prior to version 1.6.6, Fabio allows clients to remove X-Forwarded headers (except X-Forwarded-For) due to a vulnerability in how it processes hop-by-hop headers. Fabio adds HTTP headers like X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Port when routing requests to backend applications. Since the receiving application should trust these headers, allowing HTTP clients to remove or modify them creates potential security vulnerabilities. Some of these custom headers can be removed and, in certain cases, manipulated. The attack relies on the behavior that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.", "datePublished": "2025-05-30T06:14:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-30T12:24:19", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/security/advisories/GHSA-q7p4-7xjv-j3wf", "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/commit/fdaf1e966162e9dd3b347ffdd0647b39dc71a1a3", "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio", "https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.6.6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-48865", "GHSA-q7p4-7xjv-j3wf"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ac2391dc-5940-3997-b385-7fcb3b39f9b1", "product": {"name": "fabio"}, "product_version": "< 1.6.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f505e24a-306c-3e09-b440-98265de4480e", "vendor": {"name": "fabiolb"}}], "isExploited": false}
