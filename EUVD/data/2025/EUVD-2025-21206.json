This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email address. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-07-12T05:30:11", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-14T15:49:38", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/507c2abd-47d3-4a28-a9b7-a1ad9b026e7d?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/nokri-job-board-wordpress-theme/22677241"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-1313"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc7a3577-75c0-366f-8041-43fad5d9edaa", "product": {"name": "Nokri \u2013 Job Board WordPress Theme"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "be27f2d1-236d-3588-b8a4-a25423d5a918", "vendor": {"name": "scriptsbundle"}}], "isExploited": false}
