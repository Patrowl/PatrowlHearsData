However, if a\nmalicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block\ndevice while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for\ns_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,\nwhen calculating the block group of some block number (such as the\nstarting block of a preallocation region), could result in an\nunderflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in\next4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service\nattack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to\nthe block device.\n\nFor a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if\nthe system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it\nwill not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()\nwill call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in\nall of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.\n\nAlso, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an\ninline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the\ncompiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k.", "datePublished": "2025-10-01T11:45:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-01T11:45:54", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-53503", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/100c0ad6c04597fefeaaba2bb1827cc015d95067", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31668cebf45adfb6283e465e641c4f5a21b07afa", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5354b2af34064a4579be8bc0e2f15a7b70f14b5f", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/620a3c28221bb219b81bc0bffd065cc187494302", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4319e457d6e3fb33e443efeaf4634fc36e8a9ed"], "aliases": ["CVE-2023-53503", "GHSA-794g-3p8m-5jpc"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "07883263-e455-3e7b-9755-1003339875d7", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.3.4"}, {"id": "3131a0ff-e0e6-3a47-986b-def793057ed5", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.4"}, {"id": "606e3df0-b581-30f2-92c4-8e8d295609dc", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.15.113"}, {"id": "85f98bd6-5894-30e9-a8b2-5545008016de", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <5354b2af34064a4579be8bc0e2f15a7b70f14b5f"}, {"id": "86690e00-25c1-3595-b76f-91f414c2ecb0", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <b4319e457d6e3fb33e443efeaf4634fc36e8a9ed"}, {"id": "9313ef38-4dc9-3810-86ff-8a6400b77cde", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <620a3c28221bb219b81bc0bffd065cc187494302"}, {"id": "9c33759d-c48e-3754-8d0b-22b56ab1e521", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <100c0ad6c04597fefeaaba2bb1827cc015d95067"}, {"id": "b05aa7b5-bb84-3cc2-8a22-b1edd4590548", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 5.10.181"}, {"id": "d10f3fc9-fb56-3b41-bea1-c02a8757eced", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 <31668cebf45adfb6283e465e641c4f5a21b07afa"}, {"id": "f58ed6ee-aa3c-3292-85c1-0ce238cf88bf", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.1.30"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3dff772d-4d86-3cf5-9eaf-8016b6dcb6d9", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
