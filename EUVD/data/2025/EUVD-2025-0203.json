Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-01-21T15:37:58", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T20:41:21", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24017", "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b", "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24017", "GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03df88bc-edee-320f-ae65-647bc308ff0a", "product": {"name": "yeswiki"}, "product_version": "< 4.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1931a017-c2c4-3829-b1de-916d9285b365", "vendor": {"name": "YesWiki"}}], "isExploited": false}
