This is due to the `upload_file` function in the `infility_import_file` class only validating the MIME type which can be easily spoofed, and the `import_data` function missing capability checks. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T03:20:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-15T18:15:57", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/542a18f6-9d17-4e54-85e1-e01630ca371e?source=cve", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/infility-global/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12968"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12968"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c47f7644-2d14-3214-ad5f-6e9edb0260ab", "product": {"name": "Infility Global"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.14.23"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "314305b5-6282-3576-b485-b30dfaa700fc", "vendor": {"name": "infility"}}], "isExploited": false}
