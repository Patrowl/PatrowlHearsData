This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-10-25T06:49:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-27T15:54:15", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/2249ef72-9955-4636-b32f-e88720923268?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/directorist/tags/8.4.5/includes/classes/class-add-listing.php#L634", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3377181%40directorist&new=3377181%40directorist&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10488"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10488"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c798c747-2b09-32ee-b5ad-8d319688528b", "product": {"name": "Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings"}, "product_version": "* \u22648.4.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fcbc36b6-b000-3b5c-adf5-1b2adc0963d2", "vendor": {"name": "wpWax"}}], "isExploited": false}
