Prior to version 0.6.13, if cert_policy is set to none (the default value), then pam_pkcs11 will only check if the user is capable of logging into the token. An attacker may create a different token with the user's public data (e.g. the user's certificate) and a PIN known to the attacker. If no signature with the private key is required, then the attacker may now login as user with that created token. The default to *not* check the private key's signature has been changed with commit commi6638576892b59a99389043c90a1e7dd4d783b921, so that all versions starting with pam_pkcs11-0.6.0 should be affected. As a workaround, in `pam_pkcs11.conf`, set at least `cert_policy = signature;`.", "datePublished": "2025-02-10T15:43:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-21T15:48:59", "baseScore": 9.2, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-8r8p-7mgp-vf56", "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/470263258d1ac59c5eade439c4d9caba0097e6e6", "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/b665b287ff955bbbd9539252ff9f9e2754c3fb48", "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/commit/d9530167966a77115db6e885d459382a2e52ee9e", "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/releases/tag/pam_pkcs11-0.6.13"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24032"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69fbdafd-41cb-391e-9783-5e6d0f2d8f1b", "product": {"name": "pam_pkcs11"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7ca43a6c-bfa1-3027-ac59-493a0865c93f", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSC"}}], "isExploited": false}
