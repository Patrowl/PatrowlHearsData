Prior to 2.2.3, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Filerise application due to improper handling of uploaded SVG files. The application accepts user-supplied SVG uploads without sanitizing or restricting embedded script content. When a malicious SVG containing inline JavaScript or event-based payloads is uploaded, it is later rendered directly in the browser whenever viewed within the application. Because SVGs are XML-based and allow scripting, they execute in the origin context of the application, enabling full stored XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.3.", "datePublished": "2025-12-01T22:20:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-02T14:10:15", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-qrcv-vjvf-fr29", "https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/f2ce43f18f0444f8f63f7c33758d1837dd5ba91e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-66403"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b3d41fae-8706-32af-8382-d070545e3b97", "product": {"name": "FileRise"}, "product_version": "< 2.2.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23305870-b324-3f0e-b3ee-8a0e3ef3e357", "vendor": {"name": "error311"}}], "isExploited": false}
