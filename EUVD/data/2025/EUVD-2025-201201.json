The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the\nlists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&xfrm_state_gc_work).", "datePublished": "2025-12-04T16:08:17", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T17:48:29", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-40256", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7d879c19d306512c2e260f37e8a3e5c85e37c50"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-40256"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0516d330-f0f9-3a17-8cdd-058206ec23b4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.17.10"}, {"id": "6ac79d7a-769a-3ba6-8164-aa6905b4a1f4", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "6.16"}, {"id": "823e2b62-7ac3-37c6-82c6-1c3ae870d0bc", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "dc3636912d41770466543623cb76e7b88fdb42c7 <f7d879c19d306512c2e260f37e8a3e5c85e37c50"}, {"id": "97c401bb-b0d6-3ae3-8f1a-4af035a5f2d6", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.18"}, {"id": "9d8cc3fe-48d3-3dd4-97e6-8cf2ef7cc4eb", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "cad82e5d-dc9a-3e34-a783-574e336d1d06", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "b441cf3f8c4b8576639d20c8eb4aa32917602ecd <d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715"}, {"id": "f5c9a310-7195-3f0f-bd3d-a10d94d83313", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "b441cf3f8c4b8576639d20c8eb4aa32917602ecd <10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2e3f0a63-25df-3e21-96fe-9b9be20065c3", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
