Versions prior to 20.12.3 and 20.13.0 contain a vulnerability that allows script execution in the admin panel which could lead to cross-site scripting against authenticated admin users. The attack requires an admin user with configuration access, so in practicality it is not very likely to be useful given that a user with this level of access is probably already a full admin. Versions 20.12.3 and 20.13.0 contain a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-02-28T15:26:14", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-26T19:32:15", "baseScore": 2.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/security/advisories/GHSA-5pxh-89cx-4668", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27400", "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/commit/d307e5bf75729a2347dde0952fe9fd9fcd9c6aea", "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts", "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases/tag/v20.12.3", "https://github.com/OpenMage/magento-lts/releases/tag/v20.13.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27400", "GHSA-5pxh-89cx-4668"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d1635be-f9f6-39da-8107-6615a4d8a0df", "product": {"name": "magento-lts"}, "product_version": "< 20.12.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "208d951d-51d4-36ce-b00b-e33b2837e958", "vendor": {"name": "OpenMage"}}], "isExploited": false}
