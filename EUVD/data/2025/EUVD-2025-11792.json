Prior to version 9.0.7, users can be sorted by their password hash. This flaw allows an attacker to make assumptions about the hash values of other users stored in the password column of the user table, based on the results of the sorted list of users. Although unlikely, if an attacker knows the hash value of their password, they can change the password and repeat the sorting until the other user's password hash is fully revealed. This issue is patched in version 9.0.7.", "datePublished": "2025-04-16T21:45:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-17T13:14:36", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/security/advisories/GHSA-3ph3-jcfx-fq53", "https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/commit/91740192d2e2c575c6a04534c079baf9f3af0a7f", "https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/commit/bd900d0b48fe37a98def4c0e094e39e7e385e9ea"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32789"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "981085d2-aefd-38f7-964e-6c28acbbf54a", "product": {"name": "espocrm"}, "product_version": "< 9.0.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "258f0924-d0c6-3303-9a81-380b64a72366", "vendor": {"name": "espocrm"}}], "isExploited": false}
