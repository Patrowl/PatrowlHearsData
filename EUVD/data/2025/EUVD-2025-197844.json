The 'www-data' user is a member of the 'nagios' group, which has write access to '/usr/local/nagioslogserver/scripts', while several scripts in this directory are owned by root and may be executed via sudo without a password. A local attacker running as 'www-data' can move one of these root-owned scripts to a backup name and create a replacement script with attacker-controlled content at the original path, then invoke it with sudo. This allows arbitrary commands to be executed with root privileges, providing full compromise of the underlying operating system.", "datePublished": "2025-11-17T18:30:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-26T15:34:10", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.nagios.com/products/security/#log-server", "https://www.nagios.com/changelog/nagios-log-server/nagios-log-server-2026r1-0-1/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/nagios-log-server-local-privilege-escalation-via-writable-scripts-and-sudo-rules", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34323", "https://theyhack.me/Rooting-Nagios-Log-Server/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34323"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b010d641-61ff-3d25-9f2e-dfc721a57b8f", "product": {"name": "Log Server"}, "product_version": "0 <2026R1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1a53d6a1-79a1-38c0-8535-6f3330b833a6", "vendor": {"name": "Nagios"}}], "isExploited": false}
