Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2.", "datePublished": "2025-04-25T00:18:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-25T15:18:38", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322", "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/c84302972a152d851cf5dd859ff332b354b70111", "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router", "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/e6c53a0130559b4a9bd47f9cf76ea5b08a69868a/packages/react-router/lib/server-runtime/server.ts#L407", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-43864"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-43864", "GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e745c868-38c0-34e3-a7b2-a54849397517", "product": {"name": "react-router"}, "product_version": "7.2.0, < 7.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26811048-4505-322e-8fe5-6ae5289b104f", "vendor": {"name": "remix-run"}}], "isExploited": false}
