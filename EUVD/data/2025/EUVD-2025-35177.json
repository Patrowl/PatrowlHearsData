The application loads a network plugin without validating its digital signature or verifying its authenticity. A local attacker can exploit this behavior by placing a malicious component in the expected location, which is controllable by the attacker (e.g., under %APPDATA%), resulting in code execution within the context of the user. The main application is digitally signed, which may allow a malicious component to inherit trust and evade detection by security solutions that rely on signed parent processes.", "datePublished": "2025-10-21T15:31:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-22T21:31:19", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-57521", "https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/7405", "https://github.com/piuppi/Proof-of-Concepts/blob/main/Bambu%20Lab/Bambu%20Studio/README.md", "http://bambu.com", "https://wiki.bambulab.com/en/software/bambu-studio/release/release-note-2-3-0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-57521", "GHSA-mgv2-737c-m3c7"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bf8d0ab9-e07c-377d-8049-31f441f856f1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ba07987-36c3-3c0f-a4fc-5dc777dc7094", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
