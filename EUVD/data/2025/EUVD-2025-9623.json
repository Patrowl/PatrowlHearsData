A Self Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Arduino-IDE prior to version v2.3.5. The vulnerability occurs in the Additional Board Manager URLs field, which can be found in the Preferences -> Settings section of the Arduino IDE interface. In the vulnerable versions, any values entered in this field are directly displayed to the user through a notification tooltip object, without a proper output encoding routine, due to the underlying ElectronJS engine interpretation. This vulnerability exposes the input parameter to Self-XSS attacks, which may lead to security risks depending on where the malicious payload is injected. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.3.5.", "datePublished": "2025-04-02T21:09:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-03T14:01:53", "baseScore": 1.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/security/advisories/GHSA-252h-4j5q-88pc", "https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide/commit/d298b3ffc94008e89066cd999d891e84190da18f"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27608"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9927596d-2acd-349d-93ac-8e9e98a91f0d", "product": {"name": "arduino-ide"}, "product_version": "< 2.3.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "efe6b66b-76d6-3296-bd4f-388e23702e9a", "vendor": {"name": "arduino"}}], "isExploited": false}
