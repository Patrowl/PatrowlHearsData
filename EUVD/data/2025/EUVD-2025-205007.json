This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of IceWarp. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of a parameter passed to the gmaps webpage. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script.
