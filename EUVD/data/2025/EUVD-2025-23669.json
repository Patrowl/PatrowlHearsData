In versions 0.9.2 and below, the github/workflows/release-canary.yml GitHub Actions repository workflow improperly used the pull_request_target event trigger, which allowed for untrusted code from a forked pull request to be executed in a privileged context. An attacker could create a pull request containing a malicious preinstall script in the package.json file and then trigger the vulnerable workflow by posting a specific comment (!canary). This allowed for arbitrary code execution, leading to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN, and could have allowed an attacker to push malicious code to the repository or publish compromised packages to the NPM registry. There is a remediation commit which removes github/workflows/release-canary.yml, but a version with this fix has yet to be released.", "datePublished": "2025-08-05T23:31:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-06T20:29:56", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/security/advisories/GHSA-588g-38p4-gr6x", "https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/commit/9e1c9c61d742c435ac5e0901b7e0c9249b9fc70c", "https://callstack.notion.site/Post-Incident-Security-Measures-GitHub-Actions-Workflow-Vulnerability-2405d027c0f8804ab7f7cdfb43366a31"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54594"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cd2d6ba8-0347-34f7-a9f7-18687abcc07c", "product": {"name": "react-native-bottom-tabs"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b1bdc326-61a0-37bd-8cac-a95f41f7a446", "vendor": {"name": "callstackincubator"}}], "isExploited": false}
