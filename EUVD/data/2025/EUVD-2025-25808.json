This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password during a staff password reset. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with vendor-level access and above, to elevate their privilege to the level of a staff member and then change arbitrary user passwords, including those of administrators in order to gain access to their accounts. By default, the plugin allows customers to become vendors.", "datePublished": "2025-08-26T05:07:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-26T15:40:18", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/f3664a96-4ce7-4561-9b4b-dff91cd49384?source=cve", "https://dokan.co/wordpress/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5931"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "370aa40b-ea84-302c-993d-29335b4a3f9f", "product": {"name": "Dokan Pro"}, "product_version": "* \u22644.0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bbf40df1-2090-3f66-8eca-5ce3f793d9ac", "vendor": {"name": "wedevs"}}], "isExploited": false}
