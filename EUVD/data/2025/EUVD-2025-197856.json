During the EAP-Response/Identity exchange, the subscriber's full Network Access Identifier (NAI), which embeds the raw IMSI, is transmitted without encryption, tunneling, or pseudonymization. An attacker located within Wi-Fi range (~100 meters) can passively capture these frames without requiring user interaction or elevated privileges. The disclosed IMSI enables device tracking, subscriber correlation, and long-term monitoring of user presence near any broadcasting Freebox device. The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability, and the `FreeWifi_secure` service is planned for full deactivation by 1 October 2025.", "datePublished": "2025-11-17T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-18T16:23:31", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://gist.github.com/7h30th3r0n3/1a0fadb19f1528e3d3f6bad9f680c3b0#file-cve-2025-63292-frebox-imsi-md", "https://7h30th3r0n3.fr/the-vulnerability-that-killed-freewifi_secure/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63292"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-63292"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "65c78df6-e95a-3b9d-94a7-962ff09fbb6b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec7cb543-f165-3ecb-90c9-6a8042214d66", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
