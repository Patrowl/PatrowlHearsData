Versions v0.1.36 through v0.1.38 contain a bug in a RTP packet factory that can be exploited to trigger a panic with Pion based SFU via crafted RTP packets, This only affect users that use pion/interceptor. Users should upgrade to v0.1.39 or later, which validates that: `padLen > 0 && padLen <= payloadLength` and return error  on overflow, avoiding panic. If upgrading is not possible, apply the patch from the pull request manually or drop packets whose P-bit is set but whose padLen is zero or larger than the remaining payload.", "datePublished": "2025-06-09T21:13:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-10T20:04:42", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/pion/interceptor/security/advisories/GHSA-f26w-gh5m-qq77", "https://github.com/pion/webrtc/issues/3148", "https://github.com/pion/interceptor/pull/338", "https://github.com/pion/interceptor/commit/fa5b35ea867389cec33a9c82fffbd459ca8958e5", "https://github.com/pion/interceptor", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49140"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-49140", "GHSA-f26w-gh5m-qq77"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e32af70e-c829-3d52-a485-df922de689fb", "product": {"name": "interceptor"}, "product_version": "0.1.36, < 0.1.39"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d48759f2-b1bc-33d1-8d2c-8420175e25df", "vendor": {"name": "pion"}}], "isExploited": false}
