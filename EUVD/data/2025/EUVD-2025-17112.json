When Detective Mode is enabled, the plugin\u2019s logger captures the entire contents of $_POST (and sometimes raw request bodies or $_GET) without redacting any password\u2010related keys. As a result, whenever a user submits a login form, whether via native wp_login or a third\u2010party login widget, their actual password is written in clear text into the logs. An authenticated attacker or any user whose actions generate a login event will have their password recorded; an administrator (or anyone with database read access) can then read those logs and retrieve every captured password.", "datePublished": "2025-06-06T11:13:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-06T16:08:09", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6364415-da02-4236-b635-d8fbd27faa33?source=cve", "https://simple-history.com/support/detective-mode/", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-history/#developers", "https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/546", "https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/commit/68eab0cab6882eafef4bfece884093eeda5ac018", "https://wordpress.org/support/topic/security-vulnerability-passwords-stored-as-plain-text-in-logs/", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3267487/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5760"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5760"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5e748546-b99c-3701-818f-43a674ace0fe", "product": {"name": "Simple History \u2013 Track, Log, and Audit WordPress Changes"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.8.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a7fe8341-e4b7-356c-840d-e1b9c005066b", "vendor": {"name": "eskapism"}}], "isExploited": false}
