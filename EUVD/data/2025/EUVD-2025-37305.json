This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).", "datePublished": "2025-10-31T06:42:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-31T14:26:13", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c66d0fb4-e2df-4bdb-8ccb-18a96173a55d?source=cve", "https://codecanyon.net/item/user-extra-fields/12949844", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7846"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7846"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fa3c324a-2986-3e0d-8a99-0250f5f63964", "product": {"name": "WordPress User Extra Fields"}, "product_version": "* \u226416.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2c48ce46-6098-35f1-a369-f253d8a8473d", "vendor": {"name": "vanquish"}}], "isExploited": false}
