This is due to the plugin exposing state-changing REST actions through an AJAX bridge without proper CSRF token validation, and having destructive logic reachable via GET requests with no permission_callback. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to force logged-in administrators to create, update, or delete markers and geometry features via CSRF attacks, and allows anonymous users to trigger mass deletion of markers via unsafe GET requests.", "datePublished": "2025-10-09T01:48:48", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-09T18:10:57", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11166", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-google-maps/trunk/includes/class.rest-api.php#L287", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-google-maps/trunk/includes/class.rest-api.php#L45", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-google-maps/trunk/includes/class.rest-api.php#L850", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3370954%40wp-google-maps%2Ftrunk&old=3317391%40wp-google-maps%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file1", "https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2025-11166", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/840ba5b2-838a-455a-b39d-865f89c05249?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11166", "GHSA-8j57-89fx-hmh4"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cf481825-3bfa-39ec-a6fb-30ca56917435", "product": {"name": "WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps)"}, "product_version": "* \u22649.0.46"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4584ee25-c767-3f13-8992-af3e8f67ba11", "vendor": {"name": "wpgmaps"}}], "isExploited": false}
