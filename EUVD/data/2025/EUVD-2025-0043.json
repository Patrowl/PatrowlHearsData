A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users running versions of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-01-06T16:20:16", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-26T19:48:04", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-r9px-m959-cxf4", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21614", "https://github.com/go-git/go-git"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-21614", "GHSA-r9px-m959-cxf4"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fc28e5b5-88a7-31b2-b4e1-d60b8e040cbb", "product": {"name": "go-git"}, "product_version": "4.0.0, < 5.13.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d2720a42-bfdb-3319-84b3-b171fff63f64", "vendor": {"name": "go-git"}}], "isExploited": false}
