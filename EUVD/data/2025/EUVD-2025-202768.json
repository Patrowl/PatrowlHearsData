Prior to 1.2, the Express server used express.json() without a size limit, which could allow attackers to send extremely large request bodies. This can cause excessive memory usage, degraded performance, or process crashes, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Any application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected. The issue is not a flaw in Express itself, but in configuration. This issue is fixed in version 1.2. To work around, consider adding a limit option to the JSON parser, rate limiting at the application or reverse-proxy level, rejecting unusually large requests before parsing, or using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T07:40:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T20:44:17", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/security/advisories/GHSA-qgc4-8p88-4w7m", "https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/commit/197d848e5450bf85b0dd19ef8c2aa4ba96192300", "https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express", "https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/commit/8dff7f56504b356278d849734ef2050e5cd23b61", "https://github.com/Aarondoran/servify-express/releases/tag/V1.2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-67731"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-67731", "GHSA-qgc4-8p88-4w7m"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "93270ad3-c439-3d7f-953e-6753c2ffcd50", "product": {"name": "servify-express"}, "product_version": "< 1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "288d6380-4c1d-3916-b30d-b0d5555c4f2f", "vendor": {"name": "Aarondoran"}}], "isExploited": false}
