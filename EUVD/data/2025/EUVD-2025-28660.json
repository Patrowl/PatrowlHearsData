Prior to version 0.10.0, persistent volume data is world readable and that would allow non-privileged users to access sensitive data such as databases of k8s workload. The rawfile-localpv storage class creates persistent volume data under /var/csi/rawfile/ on Kubernetes hosts by default. However, the directory and data in it are world-readable. It allows non-privileged users to access the whole persistent volume data, and those can include sensitive information such as a whole database if the Kubernetes tenants are running MySQL or PostgreSQL in a container so it could lead to a database breach. This issue has been patched in version 0.10.0.", "datePublished": "2025-08-28T22:03:35", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-29T13:24:03", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/openebs/rawfile-localpv/security/advisories/GHSA-wh95-vw4r-xwx4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58061"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0bb1b841-16e5-31bc-bca3-f8c74c22c83c", "product": {"name": "rawfile-localpv"}, "product_version": "< 0.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ea3580d4-ad0b-3801-9079-9b3c3d8a0757", "vendor": {"name": "openebs"}}], "isExploited": false}
