Attackers with access to the update interface - typically via the unit's USB update port - can craft or modify firmware packages to execute arbitrary code as root, allowing persistent compromise of the device's integrity and deck randomization process. Physical or on-premises access remains the most likely attack path, though network-exposed or telemetry-enabled deployments could theoretically allow remote exploitation if misconfigured. The vendor confirmed that firmware updates have been issued to correct these update-chain weaknesses and that USB update access has been disabled on affected units.", "datePublished": "2025-10-24T23:02:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-27T15:21:02", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:P/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.ioactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IOActive-card-shuffler-security.pdf", "https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/", "https://www.wired.com/story/how-hacked-card-shufflers-allegedly-enabled-a-mob-fueled-poker-scam-that-rocked-the-nba/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/shuffle-master-deck-mate-2-insecure-update-chain", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34500"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-34500"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b7c9a75d-2685-3837-882c-a82e13a8cae9", "product": {"name": "Deck Mate 2"}, "product_version": "0 <all known versions prior to 2025-10-23"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ccc76714-622d-345c-ad36-dc0713eddd5b", "vendor": {"name": "Light & Wonder, Inc. / SHFL Entertainment, Inc. / Shuffle Master, Inc."}}], "isExploited": false}
