{"id": "EUVD-2025-4463", "enisaUuid": "dafa06b2-cbd7-3956-918d-30633a4aa983", "description": "Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A heap buffer overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.28.0 to v0.28.4. Versions prior to v0.28.0, such as v0.27.7, are **not** affected. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The heap overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fixiso`. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T19:24:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-19T15:15:44", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/security/advisories/GHSA-38h4-fx85-qcx7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-26623", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/3168", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/pull/3174", "https://github.com/jim-easterbrook/python-exiv2/commit/4cc875e392f9e0bc705fe03d929b9a382b78dae4", "https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-26623", "GHSA-38h4-fx85-qcx7"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 1.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2fc66225-99a0-3920-98e8-33755e2bcc89", "product": {"name": "exiv2"}, "product_version": "0.28.0, < 0.28.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff158ccf-0153-31b3-9fea-92985eb2af10", "vendor": {"name": "Exiv2"}}], "isExploited": false}
