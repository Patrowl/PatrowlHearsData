It enables a website to obfuscate email addresses, and should prevent spambots from collecting them. The module doesn't sufficiently validate the data attribute value on links, potentially leading to a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This is mitigated by the fact an attacker must be able to insert link (<a>) HTML elements containing data attributes into the page.", "datePublished": "2025-03-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-07T22:30:42", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-contrib-2025-007"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27823"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "55ca3732-445e-3e7e-a5fb-ad1b5fd0d753", "product": {"name": "Mail Disguise"}, "product_version": "0 <1.x-1.0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c93ff477-e82b-3aff-9831-20b9bcf23035", "vendor": {"name": "backdropcms"}}], "isExploited": false}
