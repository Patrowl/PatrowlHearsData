Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.420.7, a Remote Code Execution (RCE)*vulnerability exists in Coolify's application deployment workflow. This flaw allows a low-privileged member to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project creation or updates. By defining a malicious service that mounts the host filesystem, an attacker can achieve root-level command execution on the host OS, completely bypassing container isolation. Version 4.0.0-beta.420.7 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2026-01-05T17:39:42", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-05T19:53:41", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "references": ["https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/security/advisories/GHSA-h5xw-7xvp-xrxr"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59156"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0fecf16a-90a2-3b30-9b1a-58518309c835", "product": {"name": "coolify"}, "product_version": "< 4.0.0-beta.420.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "537269b3-59a8-3b2e-9924-a96a80f19b5e", "vendor": {"name": "coollabsio"}}], "isExploited": false}
