Versions 3.25.23 and below contain a vulnerability where certain VS Code workspace configuration files (.code-workspace) are not protected in the same way as the .vscode folder. If the agent was configured to auto-approve file writes, an attacker able to influence prompts (for example via prompt injection) could cause malicious workspace settings or tasks to be written. These tasks could then be executed automatically when the workspace is reopened, resulting in arbitrary code execution. This issue is fixed in version 3.26.0.", "datePublished": "2025-09-05T22:51:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-08T20:11:45", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/security/advisories/GHSA-4pqh-4ggm-jfmm", "https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/commit/296edfc829a7c6efc8b5dbe09aa766a9aed79598", "https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases/tag/v3.26.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-58372"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d4e2a8c9-6a3f-3720-a838-a02af77d1132", "product": {"name": "Roo-Code"}, "product_version": "< 3.26.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5b70364a-1014-3188-8980-b968df8e9a20", "vendor": {"name": "RooCodeInc"}}], "isExploited": false}
