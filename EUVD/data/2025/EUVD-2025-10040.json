A vulnerability was identified in tarteaucitron.js, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as javascript:alert(). Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link. An attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks, or modification of the user interface behavior. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.20.1.", "datePublished": "2025-04-07T14:52:12", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-12T21:03:38", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/security/advisories/GHSA-p5g4-v748-6fh8", "https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/2fa1e01023bce2e4b813200600bb1619d56ceb02", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-31476"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-31476"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34e1877e-7e4c-3f67-9a99-66b3603bb255", "product": {"name": "tarteaucitron.js"}, "product_version": "< 1.20.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "342b887d-ee0d-3dcb-bd85-15338745fab6", "vendor": {"name": "amauric"}}], "isExploited": false}
