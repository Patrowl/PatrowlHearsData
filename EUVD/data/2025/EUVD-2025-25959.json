This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to deactivate all of a site's plugins. While we escalated this to Envato after not being able to establish contact, it appears the developer added a nonce check, however that is not sufficient protection as the nonce is exposed to all users with access to the dashboard.", "datePublished": "2025-08-28T03:42:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-28T03:42:43", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0099c700-e1af-4d97-a518-151a9139ea35?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/user/liquidthemes"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-0951"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "713b0075-c353-3b73-bab4-5120db1febf3", "product": {"name": "ArcHub - Architecture and Interior Design WordPress Theme"}, "product_version": "*"}, {"id": "b8a0aa55-3bfc-354d-87a0-481cfa564166", "product": {"name": "AI Hub - Startup & Technology WordPress Theme"}, "product_version": "*"}, {"id": "cc9d7a2d-6262-31c4-8ea8-942c68355499", "product": {"name": "Hub - Responsive Multi-Purpose WordPress Theme"}, "product_version": "*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a08fb879-b4af-3503-ae4e-24fb639f1ccd", "vendor": {"name": "LiquidThemes"}}], "isExploited": false}
