An on-path attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting network traffic using a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as a trusted host and monitor or change communications between the remote metrics service and the vulnerable client.", "datePublished": "2025-01-08T16:09:46", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-13T22:24:43", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-thousandeyes-cert-pqtJUv9N"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20126"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f87189fe-4252-3757-a4ce-8ec413497d7f", "product": {"name": "Cisco ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent"}, "product_version": "1.200"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "609ca52d-16d5-3b19-8971-d6bb514490fd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
