In addition, if the product is configured to enable the individual air conditioner control function, an attacker who has access to the Wi-Fi communication between the units by exploiting this vulnerability may be able to execute ECHONET Lite commands to perform operations such as turning the air conditioner on or off and changing the set temperature. The individual air conditioner control function is available only in display unit version 02.00.01 or later and measurement unit version 02.03.01 or later.
