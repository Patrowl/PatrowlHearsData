In versions of dstack prior to 0.5.4, a malicious host may provide a crafted LUKS2 data volume to a dstack CVM for use as the `/data` mount. The guest will open the volume and write secret data using a volume key known to the attacker, causing disclosure of Wireguard keys and other secret information. The attacker can also pre-load data on the device, which could potentially compromise guest execution. LUKS2 volume metadata is not authenticated and supports null key-encryption algorithms, allowing an attacker to create a volume such that the volume opens (cryptsetup open) without error using any passphrase or token, records all writes in plaintext (or ciphertext with an attacker-known key), and/or contains arbitrary data chosen by the attacker. Version 0.5.4 of dstack contains a patch that addresses LUKS headers.", "datePublished": "2025-09-12T13:01:02", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-28T14:46:59", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/security/advisories/GHSA-jxq2-hpw3-m5wf", "https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/commit/e36ad5f732d8821876a861934e1f47cda7b1a130", "https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/blob/04de4e422bb06f075b4215b2cfc410f5d7ac7aed/dstack-util/src/system_setup.rs#L453-L456", "https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/merge_requests/837"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59054"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6f385013-e7f0-3c8e-9ae3-e10b88f58a32", "product": {"name": "dstack"}, "product_version": "< 0.5.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dd090a63-09c2-316d-8974-5dcb0c523136", "vendor": {"name": "Dstack-TEE"}}], "isExploited": false}
