Prior to version 1.7.7, a user with access to any document on a Grist installation can use a feature for fetching from a URL that is executed on the server. The privileged network access of server-side requests could offer opportunities for attack escalation. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.7. The mitigation was to use the proxy for untrusted fetches intended for such purposes. As a workaround, avoid making http/https endpoints available to an instance running Grist that expose credentials or operate without credentials.", "datePublished": "2025-11-13T21:43:57", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-14T17:10:33", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-qh95-2qv8-pqx3", "https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.7.7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-64752"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b9b9ae23-7812-35db-8d3e-f4a606875802", "product": {"name": "grist-core"}, "product_version": "< 1.7.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2fd2a0ae-080c-38e8-a166-59d5f62aacdc", "vendor": {"name": "gristlabs"}}], "isExploited": false}
