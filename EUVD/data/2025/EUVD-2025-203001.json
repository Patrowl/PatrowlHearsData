This is due to the plugin using an unsanitized user-supplied value from the shortcode's 'mode' attribute in a call to include() without proper path validation. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve full remote code execution if combined with file upload capabilities.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T03:20:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-15T18:16:04", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/527f8f08-bab3-4319-99bf-845c8b378c19?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/player-leaderboard/trunk/public/class-player-leaderboard-public.php#L1419", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3416129%40player-leaderboard&new=3416129%40player-leaderboard", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12824"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12824"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5675889b-7e3b-381c-aa67-6f988a74becf", "product": {"name": "Player Leaderboard"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 \u22641.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6651b6b1-30dd-3276-afb2-40960b4c2602", "vendor": {"name": "tharkun69"}}], "isExploited": false}
