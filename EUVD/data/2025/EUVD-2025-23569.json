Cursor allows writing in-workspace files with no user approval in versions below 1.3.9, If the file is a dotfile, editing it requires approval but creating a new one doesn't. Hence, if sensitive MCP files, such as the .cursor/mcp.json file don't already exist in the workspace, an attacker can chain a indirect prompt injection vulnerability to hijack the context to write to the settings file and trigger RCE on the victim without user approval. This is fixed in version 1.3.9.", "datePublished": "2025-08-05T00:11:07", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-05T13:58:39", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/cursor/cursor/security/advisories/GHSA-4cxx-hrm3-49rm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-54135"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b5b52497-129c-3c5a-88b8-4dfd6c2f9ca7", "product": {"name": "cursor"}, "product_version": "< 1.3.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4414ada1-4943-3509-9319-468018298d0a", "vendor": {"name": "cursor"}}], "isExploited": false}
