For example, within functions like re_parse_disjunction, the negative size is used to compute an offset (pos) for patching a jump instruction.\n\n\n  *  This negative offset is then incorrectly added to the buffer pointer (s->byte\\_code.buf + pos), leading to an out-of-bounds write on the first line of the snippet below:\n\nput_u32(s->byte_code.buf + pos, len);", "datePublished": "2025-10-16T18:30:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-29T21:30:32", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:L/SC:H/SI:H/SA:L", "references": ["https://bellard.org/quickjs/Changelog", "https://issuetracker.google.com/434196926", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62495"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62495"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "46cff50d-8add-3ebc-82cd-5a0baf047dc9", "product": {"name": "QuickJS"}, "product_version": "2025-04-26 <2025-09-13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d7857fc3-f2b0-3f66-97a3-4df9c831c2bb", "vendor": {"name": "QuickJS"}}], "isExploited": false}
