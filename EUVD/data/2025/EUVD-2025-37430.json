This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their details like email. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change arbitrary user's email addresses, including administrators, and leverage that to reset the user's password and gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-11-01T06:40:36", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-03T13:30:52", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/264cb002-bf40-4cc2-9c21-cda9bb24f494?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6574"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6574"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c0d73af8-7f59-3029-866a-a1888e0def84", "product": {"name": "Service Finder Bookings"}, "product_version": "* <6.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9d56f0bc-4219-3082-b413-e585e27795aa", "vendor": {"name": "aonetheme"}}], "isExploited": false}
