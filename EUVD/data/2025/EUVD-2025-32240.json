This affects an unknown function of the component JWT HMAC Secret Handler. Such manipulation of the argument secret with the input default leads to use of hard-coded cryptographic key\r . It is possible to launch the attack remotely. Attacks of this nature are highly complex. The exploitability is reported as difficult. The exploit is publicly available and might be used.
