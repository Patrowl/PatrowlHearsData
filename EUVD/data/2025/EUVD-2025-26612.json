Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\r\n\r This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the user profile component of Cisco Webex Meetings. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to conduct an XSS attack against the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2025-09-03T17:42:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-03T17:58:00", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-xss-55bv8hhm"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20328"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6b14ae5e-ba20-3f79-ba58-930fe3a013ab", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Meetings"}, "product_version": "N/A"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ea409c86-c46e-3210-be8e-1a8621f20445", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
