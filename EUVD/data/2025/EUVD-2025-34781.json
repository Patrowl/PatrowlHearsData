For instance, a 127-bit BigInt using radix 32 (where $\\text{log2\\_radix}=5$) is calculated to need $\\text{n\\_digits}=26$.\n\n\n  *  The maximum number of bits actually stored is $\\text{n\\_bits}=127$, which requires only two 64-bit limbs ($\\text{JS\\_LIMB\\_BITS}=64$).\n\n\n  *  The conversion loop iterates $\\text{n\\_digits}=26$ times, attempting to read 5 bits in each iteration, totaling $26 \\times 5 = 130$ bits.\n\n\n  *  In the final iterations of the loop, the code attempts to read data that spans two limbs:\n\nC\n\n\n\nc = (r->tab[pos] >> shift) | (r->tab[pos + 1] << (JS_LIMB_BITS - shift));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  *  Since the BigInt was only allocated two limbs, the read operation for r->tab[pos + 1] becomes an Out-of-Bounds Read when pos points to the last valid limb (e.g., $pos=1$).\n\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to cause the engine to read and process data from the memory immediately following the BigInt buffer. This can lead to Information Disclosure of sensitive data stored on the heap adjacent to the BigInt object.", "datePublished": "2025-10-16T18:30:24", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-29T21:30:32", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:L/VA:L/SC:H/SI:L/SA:L", "references": ["https://bellard.org/quickjs/Changelog", "https://issuetracker.google.com/434193024", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62493"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-62493"], "assigner": "Google", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "284f8580-2ad7-3de4-bca4-ef69eb589b7d", "product": {"name": "QuickJS"}, "product_version": "2025-04-26 <2025-09-13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "63d2075a-1c6c-3e64-a2f6-216dcd43539a", "vendor": {"name": "QuickJS"}}], "isExploited": false}
