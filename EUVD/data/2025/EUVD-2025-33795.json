A use-after-free (write) vulnerability has been detected in versions Poppler prior to 25.10.0 within the StructTreeRoot class. The issue arises from the use of raw pointers to elements of a `std::vector`, which can lead to dangling pointers when the vector is resized. The vulnerability stems from the way that refToParentMap stores references to `std::vector` elements using raw pointers. These pointers may become invalid when the vector is resized. This vulnerability is a common security problem involving the use of raw pointers to `std::vectors`. Internally, `std::vector `stores its elements in a dynamically allocated array. When the array reaches its capacity and a new element is added, the vector reallocates a larger block of memory and moves all the existing elements to the new location. At this point if any pointers to elements are stored before a resize occurs, they become dangling pointers once the reallocation happens. Version 25.10.0 contains a patch for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-10-10T22:11:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:11:41", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2025-042_poppler/", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1884", "https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1884#note_3114334"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-52885"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fd77c094-6eef-32ab-9d76-983ebd76b5f5", "product": {"name": "poppler"}, "product_version": "< 25.10.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c7ae0c78-9593-36ed-af5e-ab12ee25ec5d", "vendor": {"name": "poppler"}}], "isExploited": false}
