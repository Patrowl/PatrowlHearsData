These credentials, which allow root access, are disabled at the conclusion of the build. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if their nodes use VM images created via the Image Builder project and the vulnerability was exploited during the build process, which requires an attacker to access the build VM and modify the image while the build is in progress.", "datePublished": "2025-08-17T23:03:56", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T21:14:52", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/tuEsLUQu_PA", "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/133115", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-7342", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/22/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-7342"], "assigner": "kubernetes", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35d8032a-439a-3841-b0f1-fb79602435aa", "product": {"name": "Image Builder"}, "product_version": "0 \u22640.1.44"}, {"id": "b3d05d54-83f4-3a37-b050-022002bd0a1f", "product": {"name": "Image Builder"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8ab7da8a-14a1-3b4e-9c68-015daeace42e", "vendor": {"name": "Kubernetes"}}], "isExploited": false}
