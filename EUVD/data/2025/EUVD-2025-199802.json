{"id": "EUVD-2025-199802", "enisaUuid": "3ef0ac9a-31ee-348d-bba8-50b2083665e6", "description": "The FindAll Listing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is due to the 'findall_listing_user_registration_additional_params' function not restricting what user roles a user can register with. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply the 'administrator' role during registration and gain administrator access to the site. Note: The vulnerability can only be exploited if the FindAll Membership plugin is also activated, because user registration is in that plugin.", "datePublished": "2025-11-27T04:36:42", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-28T19:33:26", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/14981949-271c-4f98-a6a1-b00619f1436d?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/findall-business-directory-theme/24415962", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13538"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13538"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea224deb-f61a-3f59-9a00-4455279ae4f3", "product": {"name": "FindAll Listing"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.0.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e3aea1f2-166a-3809-9636-1bc1e219b586", "vendor": {"name": "Elated Themes"}}], "isExploited": false}
