Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest files before using their contents, allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on mismatch, warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later. As a workaround prior to updating, use only trusted .linkr manifests, manually verify manifest integrity, and host manifests on trusted servers.", "datePublished": "2025-09-16T16:48:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-16T18:26:18", "baseScore": 9.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/security/advisories/GHSA-6wph-mpv2-29xv", "https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/commit/182e5ddaa51972e144005b500c4bcebf2fd1a6c0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59334"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6a636b82-c4bb-32fa-a8af-35437ee5758f", "product": {"name": "Linkr"}, "product_version": "< 2.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d094b87-39a9-3cd0-a890-bf44308f7f35", "vendor": {"name": "mohammadzain2008"}}], "isExploited": false}
