The c_database_schema field fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the browser, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. This vulnerability can be exploited via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack due to the absence of CSRF protections on the POST request. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when visited by a victim, stores the payload persistently in the installation configuration. As a result, the payload executes whenever any user subsequently accesses the vulnerable installation page, leading to persistent client-side code execution.", "datePublished": "2025-08-05T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-07T14:03:50", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.dax-tokaido.com/recovery/install/database-configuration/", "https://gist.github.com/anonx-hunter/a7ef32a01d7d888413b08bf8589fdd7e#file-cve-2025-51541-shopware-xss-md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-51541"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e37d1804-5d38-373f-887a-a2c57a03d604", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9a696e0d-e2c8-3a4a-bd70-3b6f48dbafab", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
