Once the thread has picked up the call off of the queue,\nfurther events will cause it to be requeued, and once the socket lock is\ndropped (recvmsg uses call->user_mutex to allow the socket to be used in\nparallel), a second thread can come in and its recvmsg can pop the call off\nthe socket queue again.\n\nIn such a case, the first thread will be receiving stuff from the call and\nthe second thread will be blocked on call->user_mutex.  The first thread\ncan, at this point, process both the event that it picked call for and the\nevent that the second thread picked the call for and may see the call\nterminate - in which case the call will be \"released\", decoupling the call\nfrom the user call ID assigned to it (RXRPC_USER_CALL_ID in the control\nmessage).\n\nThe first thread will return okay, but then the second thread will wake up\nholding the user_mutex and, if it sees that the call has been released by\nthe first thread, it will BUG thusly:\n\n\tkernel BUG at net/rxrpc/recvmsg.c:474!\n\nFix this by just dequeuing the call and ignoring it if it is seen to be\nalready released.  We can't tell userspace about it anyway as the user call\nID has become stale.", "datePublished": "2025-08-16T12:30:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-19T00:31:23", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7692bde890061797f3dece0148d7859e85c55778", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/839fe96c15209dc2255c064bb44b636efe04f032", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6c75a97a32a5fa2060c3dd30207e63b6914b606d", "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/962fb1f651c2cf2083e0c3ef53ba69e3b96d3fbc", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38524"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-38524"], "assigner": "Linux", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "19f941da-07b6-3fd8-8246-8875c383938c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "248f219cb8bcbfbd7f132752d44afa2df7c241d1 <6c75a97a32a5fa2060c3dd30207e63b6914b606d"}, {"id": "25f82012-76e3-3786-82a7-65814be35a45", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "248f219cb8bcbfbd7f132752d44afa2df7c241d1 <7692bde890061797f3dece0148d7859e85c55778"}, {"id": "3568af18-c016-30da-9844-f8344b73c1a9", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.15.8"}, {"id": "422f9318-8d97-3c52-8467-d4c8090fa84b", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "4.9"}, {"id": "634dcdd0-a7fc-3b33-b718-a3f31f2cbb96", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.6.100"}, {"id": "687e2d53-9033-38e1-bda6-9458cc7b030c", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "248f219cb8bcbfbd7f132752d44afa2df7c241d1 <962fb1f651c2cf2083e0c3ef53ba69e3b96d3fbc"}, {"id": "8360fd39-58b8-3573-9d82-85945058fc40", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 0"}, {"id": "8672ff2c-e860-3313-8223-44d0cba99e94", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.12.40"}, {"id": "9954be33-a4e6-3d73-825d-9f47a35a789d", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "patch: 6.16"}, {"id": "e4d686bb-0e51-3887-93b5-5b4abe2eeccf", "product": {"name": "Linux"}, "product_version": "248f219cb8bcbfbd7f132752d44afa2df7c241d1 <839fe96c15209dc2255c064bb44b636efe04f032"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c33a4aeb-5e44-39a6-8105-c883e746b280", "vendor": {"name": "Linux"}}], "isExploited": false}
