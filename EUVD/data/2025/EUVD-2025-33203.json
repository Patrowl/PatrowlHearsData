In versions 1.7 and below, a vulnerability in the way Cursor CLI Agent protects its sensitive files (i.e. */.cursor/cli.json) allows attackers to modify the content of the files through prompt injection, thus achieving remote code execution. A prompt injection can lead to full RCE through modifying sensitive files on case-insensitive filesystems.
