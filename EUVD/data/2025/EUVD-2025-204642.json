In the default emulated shell configuration, these command emulations perform real outbound HTTP requests to attacker-supplied destinations. Because no outbound request rate limiting was enforced, unauthenticated remote attackers could repeatedly invoke these commands to generate unbounded HTTP traffic toward arbitrary third-party targets, allowing the Cowrie honeypot to be abused as a denial-of-service amplification node and masking the attacker\u2019s true source address behind the honeypot\u2019s IP.", "datePublished": "2025-12-31T21:36:19", "dateUpdated": "2026-01-02T14:35:42", "baseScore": 6.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/security/advisories/GHSA-83jg-m2pm-4jxj", "https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/pull/2800", "https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie", "https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/releases/tag/v2.9.0", "https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie/issues/2622", "https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-34469", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/cowrie-unrestricted-wget-curl-emulation-enables-ssrf-based-ddos-amplification", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83jg-m2pm-4jxj", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-34469"], "aliases": ["GHSA-83jg-m2pm-4jxj", "CVE-2025-34469"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "26de387d-bd85-32b0-85f6-eb606bace603", "product": {"name": "Cowrie"}, "product_version": "0 <2.9.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bcabfc2c-f999-3c35-8140-8946de9b747d", "vendor": {"name": "Cowrie"}}], "isExploited": false}
