A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Horilla HRM 1.3.0 allows authenticated admin or privileged users to inject malicious JavaScript payloads into multiple fields in the Project and Task modules. These payloads persist in the database and are executed when viewed by an admin or other privileged users through the web interface. Although the issue is not exploitable by unauthenticated users, it still poses a high risk of session hijacking and unauthorized action within high-privilege accounts.
