CS Cart 4.18.3 allows unrestricted upload of HTML files, which are rendered directly in the browser when accessed. This allows an attacker to upload a crafted HTML file containing malicious content, such as a fake login form for credential harvesting or scripts for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Since the content is served from a trusted domain, it significantly increases the likelihood of successful phishing or script execution against other users.", "datePublished": "2025-07-31T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-31T19:58:25", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://cs.com", "https://github.com/hackerwahab/CS-Cart-Vulns/blob/main/CVE-2025-50848.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-50848"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4a745299-493c-3e76-b2a6-6cfbb11ea622", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "47b9a67d-fc01-35ec-bd37-fa73d1207561", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
