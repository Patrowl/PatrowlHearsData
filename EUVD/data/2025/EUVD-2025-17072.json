This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the 'ss_option_maint.php' and 'ss_user_filter_list' files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete pending comments, and re-enable a previously blocked user via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.", "datePublished": "2025-06-06T06:42:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-06T16:08:45", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/aefb192a-ed42-44a9-bbd1-5906909a419c?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/stop-spammer-registrations-plugin/trunk/settings/ss_option_maint.php#L73", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/stop-spammer-registrations-plugin/trunk/settings/ss_user_filter_list.php#L239", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/stop-spammer-registrations-plugin/trunk/settings/ss_user_filter_list.php#L447", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2935"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-2935"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c28d53e7-1871-3d37-a775-c6c621eb6da5", "product": {"name": "Anti-Spam: Spam Protection | Block Spam Users, Comments, Forms"}, "product_version": "* \u22642024.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0743a453-425f-3d1a-9023-9ff8dc7936a4", "vendor": {"name": "mcitar"}}], "isExploited": false}
