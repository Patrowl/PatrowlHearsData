Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF).", "datePublished": "2025-02-11T15:20:29", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-12T15:51:14", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-38w6-vx8g-67pp", "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/77e421029cb564a97f42b6e41c9edce49f79cecd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24897"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "73a98cd0-9053-3c2e-a044-5b8e879fcca7", "product": {"name": "misskey"}, "product_version": "12.109.0, < 2025.2.0-alpha.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f95f72b-7ccf-3b94-9cdb-57a413af9e40", "vendor": {"name": "misskey-dev"}}], "isExploited": false}
