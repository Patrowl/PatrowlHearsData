This is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied file paths in the profile update functionality combined with improper handling of array inputs by PHP's filter_input() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server via the 'current_user_avatar' parameter in a two-stage attack which can make remote code execution possible. This only affects sites with the custom avatar setting enabled.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T03:20:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T14:57:28", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/9d8304bf-bec2-4fcf-9fe2-46b626b3dae9?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-manager/trunk/includes/forms/trait-wpum-account.php#L70", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-manager/tags/2.9.12/includes/forms/trait-wpum-account.php#L70", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-manager/trunk/includes/forms/trait-wpum-account.php#L75", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-manager/tags/2.9.12/includes/forms/trait-wpum-account.php#L75", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-manager/trunk/includes/forms/trait-wpum-account.php#L86", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wp-user-manager/tags/2.9.12/includes/forms/trait-wpum-account.php#L86", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13320"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13320"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "088189c0-067f-33cb-87e0-0e363c704a77", "product": {"name": "WP User Manager \u2013 User Profile Builder & Membership"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.9.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6df269c4-66e6-3fdf-999b-289fa1f80c0b", "vendor": {"name": "wpusermanager"}}], "isExploited": false}
