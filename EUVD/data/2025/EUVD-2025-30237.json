This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to claiming a business when using the claim_business AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to login as any user including admins. Please note that subscriber privileges or brute-forcing are needed when completing the business takeover. The claim_id is needed to takeover the admin account, but brute-forcing is a practical approach to obtaining valid IDs.", "datePublished": "2025-09-19T05:28:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-19T11:54:56", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/7eb018bc-2650-4e0d-8da9-325eac826d45?source=cve", "https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-5948"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5948"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea210bd1-059a-32eb-8adb-34cf0f681a38", "product": {"name": "Service Finder Bookings"}, "product_version": "* \u22646.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70ea8d0a-7d3b-3826-98a4-043714fdded5", "vendor": {"name": "aonetheme"}}], "isExploited": false}
