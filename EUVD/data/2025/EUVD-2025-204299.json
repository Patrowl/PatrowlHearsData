The values remained encrypted and securely stored at rest; however, an encrypted representation could be exposed in client responses. Updating the Certificate Signing Extension to version 1.0.12 or higher ensures configuration handling occurs exclusively on the server side, preventing encrypted values from being transmitted to or rendered by client-side components.", "datePublished": "2025-12-18T18:30:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-18T18:30:30", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.connectwise.com/company/trust/security-bulletins/2025-12-18-screenconnect-certificate-signing-extension-update", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14823"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-14823"], "assigner": "ConnectWise", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5ef4721-3592-387e-ade0-add9d63b930a", "product": {"name": "ScreenConnect"}, "product_version": "ScreenConnect (all supported versions) when used with the Certificate Signing Extension versions prior to 1.0.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fcbbe3f2-10e0-3f27-8073-4e8d0f4736f0", "vendor": {"name": "ConnectWise"}}], "isExploited": false}
