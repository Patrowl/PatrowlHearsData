This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.", "datePublished": "2025-06-13T09:30:34", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-13T09:30:34", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/978c13e5-d30c-4caa-ab6d-256f2517fd79?source=cve", "https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/auto-attachments/trunk/auto-attachments.php", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6012"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6012"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61ed5367-3a3a-3a8b-9f9c-835bb84e0197", "product": {"name": "Auto Attachments"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ba66e935-1c62-34ba-a028-3d120f031c5a", "vendor": {"name": "kaisercrazy"}}], "isExploited": false}
