It is responsible for the camera feed on Falcon, Sparrow, and Bravo devices, but exposes administrative API endpoints on port 8080 without authentication. Endpoints include but are not limited to: /reboot, /logs, /crashpack, and /adb/enable. This results in multiple impacts including denial of service (DoS) via /reboot, information disclosure via /logs, and remote code execution (RCE) via /adb/enable. The latter specifically results in adb being started over TCP without debugging confirmation, providing an attacker in the LAN/WLAN with shell access.", "datePublished": "2025-10-02T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-24T14:25:04", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59403", "https://gainsec.com/2025/09/27/fly-by-device-2-the-falcon-sparrow-gated-wireless-rce-camera-feed-dos-information-disclosure-and-more", "https://gainsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Root-from-the-Coop-Device-3_-Root-Shell-on-Flock-Safetys-Bravo-Compute-Box-GainSec.pdf", "https://www.flocksafety.com/products", "https://www.flocksafety.com/products/license-plate-readers", "https://gainsec.com/2025/09/27/fly-by-device-2-the-falcon-sparrow-gated-wireless-rce-camera-feed-dos-information-disclosure-and-more/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-59403", "GHSA-4q23-4xwf-899h"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f780a79a-00f3-31cc-b113-73d7be118783", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd3b2eca-16c3-3e63-a436-38619dbbc813", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
