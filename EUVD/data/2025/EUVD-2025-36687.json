However, the object members (i.e., child attributes) remain accessible to search queries. This exposure allows adversaries to infer or reconstruct the original contents of the excluded object.\n\n\n\n\nWorkaround - If you cannot upgrade immediately and FLS exclusion rules are used for object valued attributes (like ~object), add an additional exclusion rule for the members of the object (like ~object.*).", "datePublished": "2025-10-29T18:30:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-29T18:30:32", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://search-guard.com/cve-advisory/", "https://docs.search-guard.com/latest/changelog-searchguard-flx-3_1_2", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-12147"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-12147"], "assigner": "floragunn", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4507a1d4-a93d-37f6-8beb-1a9260a0f029", "product": {"name": "Search Guard FLX"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 \u22643.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23681139-1967-3aa4-9bab-fd74a53f1bfd", "vendor": {"name": "floragunn"}}], "isExploited": false}
