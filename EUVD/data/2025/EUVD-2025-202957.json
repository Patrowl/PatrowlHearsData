This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the plugin's reset functionality. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the reset operation is performed via a GET request, making exploitation trivial via image tags or hyperlinks.", "datePublished": "2025-12-12T03:21:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-18T20:38:41", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/eab5de7e-ddab-4c6f-af87-acce7b5ff15b?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rabbit-hole/trunk/functions/admin.php#L7", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/rabbit-hole/tags/1.1/functions/admin.php#L7", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-13366"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-13366"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fbbc7183-e265-35ce-ad14-418b65fb081f", "product": {"name": "Rabbit Hole"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af4e4fda-8c3d-3419-bfe8-26bc9ce7c321", "vendor": {"name": "frapesce"}}], "isExploited": false}
