It identifies itself as a device without input or output capabilities, which results in the use of the Just Works pairing method. This method does not implement any authentication, which therefore allows machine-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, this lack of authentication allows attackers to interact with the device via BLE without requiring prior authorization.", "datePublished": "2025-06-20T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-20T13:53:04", "baseScore": 0.0, "references": ["https://syss.de", "https://support.coros.com/hc/en-us/articles/20087694119828-COROS-PACE-3-Release-Notes", "https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2025-024.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32877"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "71f18a6c-ca64-3524-b5b2-c7655cf04bef", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fea3aa38-aa77-33b6-baa9-a33ea96fe092", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
