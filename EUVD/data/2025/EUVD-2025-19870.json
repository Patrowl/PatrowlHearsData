The challenge is sent from the server to the client, is encrypted by the client and sent back. The server does the same encryption locally and if the responses match it is prooven that the client knows the correct password. Since all VNC communication is unencrypted, an attacker can obtain the challenge and response and try to derive the password from this information.", "datePublished": "2025-07-03T11:33:30", "dateUpdated": "2025-07-03T13:15:43", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.endress.com", "https://sick.com/psirt", "https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices", "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1", "https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2025/sca-2025-0008.json", "https://sick.com/psirt", "https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2025/sca-2025-0008.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-27458"], "assigner": "SICK AG", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "28aeca88-e408-303c-ad53-bb6357bb4c80", "product": {"name": "Endress+Hauser MEAC300-FNADE4"}, "product_version": "vers:all/*"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2121eac8-36eb-35a9-a542-77b17f210f72", "vendor": {"name": "Endress+Hauser"}}], "isExploited": false}
