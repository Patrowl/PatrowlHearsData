This is due to a lack of restriction on user role in the 'nsl_registration_store_extra_input' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an account on the site with an arbitrary role, including Administrator, when registering via a social login. The Nextend Social Login plugin must be installed and configured to exploit the vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-04-25T11:12:53", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-25T11:57:50", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-2470", "https://themeforest.net/item/service-finder-service-and-business-listing-wordpress-theme/15208793", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/a1f62cda-262b-46d9-a839-0a573813cfa1?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-2470", "GHSA-mcrr-9jjf-26v7"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4c2f1251-089e-3bda-8976-c93840dd8d79", "product": {"name": "Service Finder Bookings"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d998052c-531f-31d4-895b-818e25405487", "vendor": {"name": "aonetheme"}}], "isExploited": false}
