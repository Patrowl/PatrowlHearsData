Prior to version 2.4.4, an out-of-bounds array access issue exists in WAMR's fast interpreter mode during WASM bytecode loading. When frame_ref_bottom and frame_offset_bottom arrays are at capacity and a GET_GLOBAL(I32) opcode is encountered, frame_ref_bottom is expanded but frame_offset_bottom may not be. If this is immediately followed by an if opcode that triggers preserve_local_for_block, the function traverses arrays using stack_cell_num as the upper bound, causing out-of-bounds access to frame_offset_bottom since it wasn't expanded to match the increased stack_cell_num. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.4.", "datePublished": "2025-11-25T22:13:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-26T14:50:41", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/security/advisories/GHSA-gvx3-gg3x-rjcx", "https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime/releases/tag/WAMR-2.4.4"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-64713"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ab1f958-9730-395f-9176-e15569ebbf38", "product": {"name": "wasm-micro-runtime"}, "product_version": "< 2.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1d81dbce-9a17-36e9-bc68-0d900e24cfea", "vendor": {"name": "bytecodealliance"}}], "isExploited": false}
