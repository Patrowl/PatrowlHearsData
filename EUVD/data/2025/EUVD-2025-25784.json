Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.\n\nAccording to Apple documentation, when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has \"get-task-allow\" entitlement, the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.\n\n\nThis issue was fixed in version 5.0.175", "datePublished": "2025-08-26T12:23:04", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-26T13:48:30", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://cert.pl/en/posts/2025/08/tcc-bypass/", "https://invoiceninja.com/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-8700"], "assigner": "CERT-PL", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d020bf8-1d2b-3bec-87a4-45da6fa67e7f", "product": {"name": "Invoice Ninja"}, "product_version": "0 <5.0.175"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "282b4f55-9a98-3327-9d5b-a0ad8f2bfbe4", "vendor": {"name": "Invoice Ninja"}}], "isExploited": false}
