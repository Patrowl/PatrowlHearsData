An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2025-01-08T16:19:19", "dateUpdated": "2025-01-08T20:34:39", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cspc-xss-CDOJZyH", "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-xwork-xss-KCcg7WwU"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-20167"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "055eadb4-e0bc-3ac4-8cb3-4da1d9d4eb08", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11"}, {"id": "35d6193e-40a6-30c7-a002-d38dbc25dc9a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.3"}, {"id": "7c66cffb-4bc5-3f7b-8ca8-1501cbcd696e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.2"}, {"id": "b3f803a4-a2bb-369e-870b-7e0ddcbdc3f6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "2.11.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d6d4d0d-ac93-3bbd-b1cf-fce8cab95faa", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
