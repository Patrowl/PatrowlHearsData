Prior to version 0.6.12, a normal user is able to access and modify APP orchestration, even though the web UI of APP orchestration is not presented for a normal user. This access control flaw allows non-admin users to make unauthorized access and changes on the APPSs. This issue has been patched in version 0.6.12. A workaround for this vulnerability involves updating the the access control mechanisms to enforce stricter user role permissions and implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only users with admin privileges can access Orchestration of the APPs.", "datePublished": "2025-04-25T15:05:32", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-25T15:54:38", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "references": ["https://github.com/langgenius/dify/security/advisories/GHSA-6pw4-jqhv-3626", "https://github.com/langgenius/dify/pull/5266"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-43862"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0cabee3c-6af8-3a6e-a4ff-803cec5f4322", "product": {"name": "dify"}, "product_version": "< 0.6.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94751d60-ba6e-3d57-8b8a-d7fab36f7ab1", "vendor": {"name": "langgenius"}}], "isExploited": false}
