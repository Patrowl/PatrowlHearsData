This is due to improper configurations in the 'jobsearch_xing_response_data_callback', 'set_access_tokes', and 'google_callback' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected Xing user, or any connected Xing user if the Xing id is known. It is also possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first connected Google user if the user has logged in, without subsequently logging out, in thirty days. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.8.4.", "datePublished": "2025-04-25T11:12:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-25T13:53:07", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-11917", "https://codecanyon.net/item/jobsearch-wp-job-board-wordpress-plugin/21066856", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6de8a608-8715-4f9c-9f2f-df60dd1cc579?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-11917", "GHSA-hpf6-jp82-wrpj"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "707445c6-8299-36dd-8172-0f2d99311967", "product": {"name": "JobSearch WP Job Board"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.8.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4fb7c016-a11b-3064-8f09-6ee579115f71", "vendor": {"name": "eyecix"}}], "isExploited": false}
