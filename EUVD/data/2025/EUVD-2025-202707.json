They allow potential arbitrary code execution when processing crafted PDF files. The vulnerability stems from insufficient handling of memory allocation failures after assigning an extremely large value to a form field's charLimit property via JavaScript. This can result in memory corruption and may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by persuading a user to open a malicious file.", "datePublished": "2025-12-11T18:30:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-11T18:30:44", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.foxit.com/support/security-bulletins.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55313"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-55313"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc4ad906-d9aa-3db0-9f2d-3eaefd3ac578", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4ab65765-5d1b-3972-8d7a-689b9410268e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
