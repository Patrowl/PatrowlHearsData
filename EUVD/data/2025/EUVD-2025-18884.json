This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Sony XAV-AX8500 devices. An attacker must first obtain the ability to pair a malicious Bluetooth device with the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the Bluetooth L2CAP protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the elysian-bt-service process.
