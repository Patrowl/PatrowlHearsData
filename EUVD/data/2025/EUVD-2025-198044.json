{"id": "EUVD-2025-198044", "enisaUuid": "abe54052-f071-3960-af75-9fcfbbc5585b", "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Awesome Miner thru 11.2.4 that allows arbitrary read and write to kernel memory and MSRs (such as LSTAR) as an unprivileged user. This is due to the implementation of an insecure version of WinRing0 (1.2.0.5, renamed to IntelliBreeze.Maintenance.Service.sys) that lacks a properly secured DACL, allowing unprivileged users to interact with the driver and, as a result, the kernel. This can result in local privilege escalation, information disclosure, denial of service, and other unspecified impacts.", "datePublished": "2025-11-18T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-18T17:04:06", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.awesomeminer.com/download", "https://dreadsec.co/p/cve-2025-63602-hijacking-system-calls-with-a-popular-crypto-miner.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-63602"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-63602"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a65bdbd5-7dd2-3ee8-824f-91de3c28c074", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9847fdfb-3532-380c-b95a-5935d6ef3eff", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
