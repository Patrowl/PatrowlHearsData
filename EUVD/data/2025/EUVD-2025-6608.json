A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`.", "datePublished": "2025-03-17T22:50:49", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-17T22:50:49", "baseScore": 8.9, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "references": ["https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-q4v2-fvrv-qrf6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-29913"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "660a5cde-1ca4-3661-9d96-b24f0f088bca", "product": {"name": "CryptoLib"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.3.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e782e45d-77e1-38ad-9d1d-63b84e8fe81c", "vendor": {"name": "NASA"}}], "isExploited": false}
