Prior to version 1.9.5, if the clone URL returned by GitHub is malicious (or can be injected using upstream vulnerabilities) a shell script injection can occur within the `withpasswd` function. Alternatively, an argument injection is possible in the `gettreesha `function. either of these can then lead to a potential RCE. Users should upgrade immediately to v1.9.5 to receive a fix. All prior versions are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.", "datePublished": "2025-06-25T16:39:45", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-26T14:38:03", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/security/advisories/GHSA-589r-g8hf-xx59", "https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/pull/448"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-52483"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72315b67-4820-37c8-b771-228b6324f278", "product": {"name": "Registrator.jl"}, "product_version": "< 1.9.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d10ccb59-7f43-396d-aa39-1a4fc08cf698", "vendor": {"name": "JuliaRegistries"}}], "isExploited": false}
