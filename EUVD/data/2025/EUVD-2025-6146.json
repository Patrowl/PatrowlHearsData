The ChecksumCalculator class within allows for hashing and checksum generation, but it includes or defaults to algorithms that are no longer recommended for secure cryptographic use cases (e.g., SHA-1, CRC32, and SSDEEP). These algorithms, while possibly valid for certain non-security-critical tasks, can expose users to security risks if used in scenarios where strong cryptographic guarantees are required.
