This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled HTTP headers (such as X-Forwarded-For, HTTP_CLIENT_IP, and similar headers) to determine user IP addresses in the `pp_get_ip_address()` function when the \"Use transients\" feature is enabled. This makes it possible for attackers to bypass authorization by spoofing these headers with the IP address of a legitimately authenticated user, granted the \"Use transients\" option is enabled (non-default configuration) and the site is not behind a CDN or reverse proxy that overwrites these headers.", "datePublished": "2025-10-25T05:31:20", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-27T15:49:58", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-11244", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/password-protected/tags/2.7.11/includes/transient-functions.php#L33", "https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2025-11244", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/30b4371d-54a2-4111-ad2c-b38b6b31884d?source=cve", "https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2025-11244/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-11244", "GHSA-qpv7-hgm5-vr7r"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "170d6a78-fd83-3d33-bbe1-33f76dc1f311", "product": {"name": "Password Protected \u2014 Lock Entire Site, Pages, Posts, Categories, and Partial Content"}, "product_version": "* \u22642.7.11"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f1519df-3c49-3e2d-8c61-c184f424b34f", "vendor": {"name": "saadiqbal"}}], "isExploited": false}
