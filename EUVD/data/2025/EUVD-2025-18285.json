If a string is already very large, combining it with more input can cause a hidden overflow in the size calculation. This makes the system think it has enough memory when it doesn\u2019t. As a result, data may be written past the end of the allocated memory, leading to crashes or memory corruption.", "datePublished": "2025-06-13T15:40:38", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-07T00:42:01", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6052", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2372666", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6052"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6052"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "efbdd84f-abe4-340e-918a-c040313a61d1", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
