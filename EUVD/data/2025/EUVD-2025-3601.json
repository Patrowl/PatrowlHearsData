In versions 0.6.12 and prior, the pam_pkcs11 module segfaults when a user presses ctrl-c/ctrl-d when they are asked for a PIN. When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault. The most likely impact to a system affected by this issue is an availability impact due to a daemon that uses PAM crashing. As of time of publication, a patch for the issue is unavailable.", "datePublished": "2025-02-10T15:38:39", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-10T15:50:52", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/security/advisories/GHSA-wvr3-c9x3-9mff", "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/blob/bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c#L211", "https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_pkcs11/blob/bb2e3f3a95e44fdf44b0d5a4b377db3179021380/src/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.c#L797"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24031"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "42117076-0a94-358c-bcac-8c22d6214f34", "product": {"name": "pam_pkcs11"}, "product_version": "\u2264 0.6.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3446b860-54c6-3a2c-81ce-291ed034d740", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSC"}}], "isExploited": false}
