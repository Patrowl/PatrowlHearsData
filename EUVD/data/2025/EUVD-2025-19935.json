The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.", "datePublished": "2025-07-04T08:16:47", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-12T16:10:28", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5351", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2369367"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-5351"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "874c2186-70f6-3d5a-93aa-dd9545d7068f", "product": {"name": "libssh"}, "product_version": "0.10.0 <0.11.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "538e3125-f49e-3100-8693-13f3d224549d", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}, {"id": "f71b62ae-6267-395d-b0ab-a5192fa661d8", "vendor": {"name": "libssh"}}], "isExploited": false}
