In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website.", "datePublished": "2025-04-22T17:32:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-25T16:02:55", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32951", "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html", "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-jmix-application", "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-32951", "GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "00a053b6-8f52-380b-87ce-df6d820c1a4d", "product": {"name": "jmix"}, "product_version": "2.0.0, < 2.4.0"}, {"id": "184ef417-95bd-3a7d-abb0-f13ee6431b7e", "product": {"name": "jmix"}, "product_version": "1.0.0, < 1.6.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94922e2a-c324-3d46-9558-9b530994e01c", "vendor": {"name": "jmix-framework"}}], "isExploited": false}
