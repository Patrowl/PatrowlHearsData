This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to retrieve access to a back-up's filename while a backup is running. This information has little value on it's own, but could be used to aid in a brute force attack to retrieve back-up contents in limited environments (i.e. NGINX).", "datePublished": "2025-10-25T04:22:44", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-27T15:57:24", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10579", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3381187%40backwpup%2Ftrunk&old=3362645%40backwpup%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=#file23", "https://research.cleantalk.org/cve-2025-10579", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/1e9a1484-2000-47fa-9890-fa02eddabcd9?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10579", "GHSA-vq3q-xwqw-cc8c"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "88baef6b-3bb8-3831-a173-2dee64e75a2f", "product": {"name": "BackWPup \u2013 WordPress Backup & Restore Plugin"}, "product_version": "* \u22645.5.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "677e7c17-8335-3d01-9f20-b8c67061a3c2", "vendor": {"name": "wp_media"}}], "isExploited": false}
