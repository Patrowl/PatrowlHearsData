This temporary file is created in a directory accessible to all users on the system. An unauthorized local user or process can exploit this behavior by placing a file lock on the temporary token file using the flock system call. This prevents MinKNOW from completing the token generation process. As a result, no valid local token is created, and the software is unable to execute commands on the sequencer. This leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, blocking sequencing operations.", "datePublished": "2025-10-23T21:31:43", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-23T21:31:43", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-medical-advisories/icsma-25-294-01", "https://github.com/cisagov/CSAF/blob/develop/csaf_files/OT/white/2025/icsma-25-294-01.json", "https://nanoporetech.com/software/", "https://nanoporetech.com/about/contact", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-10937"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-10937"], "assigner": "icscert", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "36bb639d-f1c0-3a24-ab2a-80628fdf89ed", "product": {"name": "MinKNOW"}, "product_version": "0 <24.11"}, {"id": "ec6b84d5-f9c0-3f94-89d8-39b96401051a", "product": {"name": "MinKNOW"}, "product_version": ""}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6f98d98a-12eb-3d15-ac99-bb832cd2f5e4", "vendor": {"name": "Oxford Nano Technologies"}}], "isExploited": false}
