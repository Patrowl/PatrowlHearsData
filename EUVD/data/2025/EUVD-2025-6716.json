This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user's identity prior to updating their password through the 'boombox_ajax_reset_password' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level privileges and above, to change arbitrary user's passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.", "datePublished": "2025-03-19T04:21:06", "dateUpdated": "2025-03-19T14:03:01", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12295", "https://themeforest.net/item/boombox-viral-buzz-wordpress-theme/16596434", "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/c453aaf6-767d-4929-bbb3-3c0b78b0507a?source=cve"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-12295", "GHSA-wq5g-2475-cmrr"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2fd9a317-7499-3a44-a17d-7465160f62ea", "product": {"name": "BoomBox Theme Extensions"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "325146e3-d623-3778-afb4-9d6130cc8717", "vendor": {"name": "PX-lab"}}], "isExploited": false}
