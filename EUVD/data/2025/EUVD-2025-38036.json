In versions 1.61.11 below, as well as 2.0.0-alpha.0 through 2.8.1-rc.0, a vulnerability allowed for unauthenticated queries to access data that required additional access controls. Router incorrectly handled access control directives on interface types/fields and their implementing object types/fields, applying them to interface types/fields while ignoring directives on their implementing object types/fields when all implementations had the same requirements. Apollo Router customers defining @authenticated, @requiresScopes, or @policy directives inconsistently on polymorphic types (i.e., object types that implement interface types) are impacted. This issue is fixed in versions 1.61.12 and 2.8.1.", "datePublished": "2025-11-06T20:42:51", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-07T13:48:35", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/apollographql/router/security/advisories/GHSA-x33c-7c2v-mrj9", "https://github.com/apollographql/router/commit/75ca43ecb9d38423b63d09896702f9da425cc754", "https://github.com/apollographql/router", "https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases/tag/v2.8.1", "https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/security/authorization#authorization-directives", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64173"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-64173", "GHSA-x33c-7c2v-mrj9"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "083e945d-603c-329c-8b39-fe3b2355c5ad", "product": {"name": "Router"}, "product_version": "2.8.1-rc.0, < 2.8.1"}, {"id": "0cf98341-af28-3976-81a1-25b4f1215693", "product": {"name": "Router"}, "product_version": "< 1.61.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "846fd6d5-15c0-3fd9-b067-5d03973eb1eb", "vendor": {"name": "apollographql"}}], "isExploited": false}
