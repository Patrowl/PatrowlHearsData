Although UUIDv4 conversation IDs are generated server-side and are difficult to brute force, they can be obtained from less-protected sources such as server-side access logs, browser history, or screenshots. The vulnerability permits a logged-in user to gain read-only access to another user's conversations by exploiting the `/api/share/conversationID` endpoint, which lacks authorization checks. This issue is resolved in version v0.7.9-rc1.", "datePublished": "2025-09-11T03:30:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-11T03:30:54", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://huntr.com/bounties/361405bb-a739-41eb-a680-4cb6193e7c76", "https://github.com/danny-avila/librechat/commit/3af2666890bbf291cb7b9f3e03592d54714f0ff5", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6088"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-6088"], "assigner": "@huntr_ai", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ace0a68-8fb5-3876-9b1a-4d94f65ec557", "product": {"name": "danny-avila/librechat"}, "product_version": "unspecified <v0.7.9-rc1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a771d36d-7bde-3498-8553-1111c8c9815d", "vendor": {"name": "danny-avila"}}], "isExploited": false}
