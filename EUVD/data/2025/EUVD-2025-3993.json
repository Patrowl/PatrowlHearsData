HTML Injection occurs when an application improperly validates or sanitizes user inputs, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML code. In this scenario, the vulnerability exists in the \"Add Target\" functionality of the application, where the Target Organization and Target Description fields accept HTML payloads. The injected HTML is rendered and executed in the target area, potentially leading to malicious actions. Exploitation of HTML Injection can compromise the application's integrity and user trust. Attackers can execute unauthorized actions, steal sensitive information, or trick users into performing harmful actions. The organization's reputation, customer trust, and regulatory compliance could be negatively affected. This issue affects all versions up to and including 2.2.0. Users are advised to monitor the project for future releases which address this issue. There are no known workarounds.", "datePublished": "2025-02-04T19:26:54", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-04T19:55:31", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L", "references": ["https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/security/advisories/GHSA-4phc-m2wm-p8x6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-24966"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5e878cdd-44ef-3305-93c1-56e001458083", "product": {"name": "rengine"}, "product_version": "\u2264 2.2.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c54bc8f8-41f7-3f4d-9169-220fc02f17f4", "vendor": {"name": "yogeshojha"}}], "isExploited": false}
