By leveraging knowledge of several identifiers generated close to the same time, the attacker could determine a desired identifier which could enable them to access limited system information. This poses a low risk to confidentiality without impacting the integrity or availability of the service.", "datePublished": "2025-09-09T02:09:55", "dateUpdated": "2025-09-09T02:09:55", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://me.sap.com/notes/3640477", "https://url.sap/sapsecuritypatchday"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-42925"], "assigner": "sap", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29c8a012-24c4-3c3f-91c2-61858da884f2", "product": {"name": "SAP NetWeaver AS Java (IIOP Service)"}, "product_version": "SERVERCORE 7.50"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "89aa1d87-273f-3030-8788-9191bdee0558", "vendor": {"name": "SAP_SE"}}], "isExploited": false}
