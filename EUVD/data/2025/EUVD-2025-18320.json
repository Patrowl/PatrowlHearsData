This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. Administrators have the ability to extend file manager usage privileges to lower-level users including subscribers, which would make this vulnerability more severe on such sites.", "datePublished": "2025-06-14T05:32:01", "dateUpdated": "2025-06-17T18:40:09", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/00df02cd-b4d3-477a-86ee-aa2f9b5216e8?source=cve", "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&new=3310066%40filester%2Ftrunk&old=3294389%40filester%2Ftrunk&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-3234"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-3234"], "assigner": "Wordfence", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "deb95bc1-f132-34f7-a6fa-c611c8658f9d", "product": {"name": "File Manager Pro \u2013 Filester"}, "product_version": "* \u22641.8.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e7660abe-a02e-338c-bd66-6cf98e14c371", "vendor": {"name": "NinjaTeam"}}], "isExploited": false}
