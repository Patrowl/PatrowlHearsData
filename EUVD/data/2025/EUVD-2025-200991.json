The application follows symbolic links placed inside the ~/Library/Logs/Aquarius directory and treats them as regular files. When building the support ZIP, Aquarius recursively enumerates logs using a JUCE directory iterator configured to follow symlinks, and later writes file data without validating whether the target is a symbolic link. A local attacker can exploit this behavior by planting symlinks to arbitrary filesystem locations, resulting in unauthorized disclosure or modification of arbitrary files. When chained with the associated HelperTool privilege escalation issue, root-owned files may also be exposed.", "datePublished": "2025-12-03T18:30:26", "dateUpdated": "2025-12-03T18:30:26", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-65843", "https://almightysec.com/insecure-file-handling-via-symlink", "https://almightysec.com/insecure-file-handling-via-symlink/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2025-65843", "GHSA-3h59-4588-8c38"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c768e46c-dcfc-3c5a-bc15-771a6f93ba19", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a14ef2c1-770a-3884-8a5e-8def59b34cbd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
