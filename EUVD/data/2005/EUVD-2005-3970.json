NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Internet Explorer and the proper fix should be in that browser; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in Drupal.", "datePublished": "2005-12-03T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T23:31:48", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-958", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2005/2684", "http://securityreason.com/securityalert/220", "http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-958", "http://secunia.com/advisories/18630", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15663", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/418291/100/0/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/17824", "http://drupal.org/files/sa-2005-008/advisory.txt", "http://drupal.org/files/sa-2005-008/4.6.3.patch"], "aliases": ["CVE-2005-3975"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.82, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "594f678e-2f86-304a-9d2c-3ee5da34f3f5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b86987a4-b69a-335e-97d2-3d7841d7b848", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
