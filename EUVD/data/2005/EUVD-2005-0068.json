NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability.  While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2005-01-19T05:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T20:57:41", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0067.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/13124", "http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2005-0067"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4acfe73b-c86e-33ac-89fb-c06ecd707ea0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d8818a43-4208-3f3a-b574-983ecb120e87", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
