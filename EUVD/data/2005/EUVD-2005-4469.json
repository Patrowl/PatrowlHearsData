NOTE: it is not clear whether this problem can be exploited for code execution. If not, then perhaps the user-assisted nature of the attack should exclude the issue from inclusion in CVE.", "datePublished": "2005-12-22T01:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T23:46:05", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["http://securityreason.com/securityalert/290", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/420006/100/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15999"], "aliases": ["CVE-2005-4474"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b024aa96-d3df-362f-bff0-6d1e049ae9a8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9083f4cd-5b1d-330e-8778-a49ceea0f65a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
