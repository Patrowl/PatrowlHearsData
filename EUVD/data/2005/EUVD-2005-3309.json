NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Internet Explorer (CVE-2005-3312) and the proper fix should be in that browser; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpBB.", "datePublished": "2005-10-25T04:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T23:10:08", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N", "references": ["https://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-925", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/15170", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/22837", "http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa-925", "http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2005-10/0479.html", "http://secunia.com/advisories/18098", "http://secunia.com/advisories/17295/", "http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=113017003617987&w=2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2005-3310"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "398f6db2-c3a8-3679-a424-d353bafd95ad", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c033ed21-0721-34ed-940e-f0b7daf6f703", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
