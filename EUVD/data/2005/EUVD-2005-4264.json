NOTE: the normal operation of InfoPath appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath.  If no realistic scenarios exist for this problem in other products, then perhaps it should be excluded from CVE.", "datePublished": "2005-12-15T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:18:55", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C", "references": ["http://support.microsoft.com/kb/908233/", "http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/6V00B1FEUE.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2005-4269"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 15.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "21b3a3ba-0bfd-3318-9d7c-3d7edda308b8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26f29e0e-da15-34d0-a6f5-eabb55f9e128", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
