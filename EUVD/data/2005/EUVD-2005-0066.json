NOTE: CVE-2004-0790, CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability.  While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2005-01-19T05:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T20:57:40", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0065.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/13124", "http://www.gont.com.ar/drafts/icmp-attacks-against-tcp.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2005-0065"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "09c33334-8a9c-3018-942d-bd8d4416cef4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b7acaa7e-f24c-3312-8f42-8e30d36013d3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
