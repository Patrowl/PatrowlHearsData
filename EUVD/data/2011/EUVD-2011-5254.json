The flaw occurs due to improper bounds checking in the file parser, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code. Exploitation is achieved via a crafted payload that bypasses DEP and ASLR protections using ROP techniques, and requires user interaction to open the file.", "datePublished": "2025-08-20T15:37:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-20T15:37:52", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://mjm-software.com", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/mjm_quickplayer_s3m.rb", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17229", "https://web.archive.org/web/20111016194042/https://www.corelan.be/index.php/forum/security-advisories/corelan-11-003-mjm-quickplayer-2-3-2010-stack-buffer-overflow-s3m/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/mjm-quickplayer-s3m-stack-based-buffer-overflow"], "aliases": ["CVE-2011-10023"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 12.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ab5408b-f34d-3948-8402-a979a4f56f54", "product": {"name": "QuickPlayer"}, "product_version": "2010"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c0f1c802-2342-3fee-8f3e-b2c24c0195b6", "vendor": {"name": "MJM Software"}}], "isExploited": false}
