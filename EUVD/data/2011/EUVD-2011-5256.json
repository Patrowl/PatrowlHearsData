The vulnerability arises from an unsafe strcpy() operation that fails to validate input length, allowing attackers to overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH). By crafting a malicious .mmm file, an attacker can trigger the overflow when the file is opened, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability was remediated in version 17.", "datePublished": "2025-08-20T15:36:31", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-20T15:36:31", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/windows/fileformat/magix_musikmaker_16_mmm.rb", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17329", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17313", "https://www.magix.com/us/music-editing/music-maker/", "https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/another-researcher-hit-with-threat-of-german-anti-hacking-law", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110503060356/https://www.corelan.be/index.php/forum/security-advisories/corelan-11-002-magix-music-maker-16-stack-buffer-overflow/", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/magix-musik-maker-stack-based-buffer-overflow"], "aliases": ["CVE-2011-10021"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 12.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f7f9cf5e-3e27-3e48-bbfd-df319d8cda7d", "product": {"name": "Magix Musik Maker"}, "product_version": "* \u226416"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9dedbea4-6ba2-366a-b71f-4f933010ad42", "vendor": {"name": "MAGIX Software GmbH"}}], "isExploited": false}
