NOTE: it could be argued that this is a design limitation of the Net::HTTPS API, and separate implementations should be independently assigned CVE identifiers for not working around this limitation. However, because this API was modified within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been assigned.", "datePublished": "2011-05-13T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T17:53:46", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0633.html", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2011-0633.html", "http://vttynotes.blogspot.com/2010/12/man-in-middle-fun-with-perl-lwp.html", "http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/GAAS/libwww-perl-6.02/Changes", "http://vttynotes.blogspot.com/2011/03/quick-note-on-lwp-and-perl-security-cve.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2011-0633"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ac899c9e-4d4e-3d88-a16a-a2d05fdcbf9b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3786d15c-afca-3002-b3f6-0fd7baafad3c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
