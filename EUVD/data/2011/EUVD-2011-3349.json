NOTE: the vendor has disputed the severity of this issue, saying \"we believe the risk of deliberate, malicious, or unauthorized manipulation of medical devices is extremely low... we strongly believe it would be extremely difficult for a third-party to wirelessly tamper with your insulin pump... you would be able to detect tones on the insulin pump that weren't intentionally programmed and could intervene accordingly.\"", "datePublished": "2022-05-17T01:53:27", "dateUpdated": "2025-04-11T03:50:14", "baseScore": 4.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P", "references": ["http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HackersCanKillDiabeticsWithInsulinPumpsFromAHalfMileAwayUmNoFactsVsJournalisticFearMongering.aspx", "http://www.scmagazineus.com/black-hat-insulin-pumps-can-be-hacked/article/209106/", "http://www.loop-blog.com/Blog_Full_Post?id=a09C000000Dbz3JIAR", "http://sixuntilme.com/blog2/2011/08/hacked_jay_radcliffe_insulin_p.html", "http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/08/04/insulin-pumps-vulnerable-to-hacking/?test=faces", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/69643", "http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/vulnerabilities/231600265", "http://www.darkreading.com/security/vulnerabilities/231300312/getting-root-on-the-human-body.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-3386"], "aliases": ["CVE-2011-3386"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a7fc8f5f-39ed-3ad4-beff-28713cd18471", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b1149f99-9bde-3e2a-bf63-61d4c8664c33", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
