These rsp buffers have values in them, such as buffer lengths, that need to be validated to ensure that no buffer overflow/over-reads happen. However, rsp buffers are not always in locked memory, meaning a time-of-check, time-of-use issue can occur where we check that the value is valid, but then a race condition occurs where this memory is swapped out with a different, possibly out of range, value.", "datePublished": "2018-04-18T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T19:00:25", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-04-01", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103671"], "aliases": ["CVE-2015-9157"], "assigner": "qualcomm", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "cc6fea35-fcea-38c4-907e-7958e6fb8516", "product": {"name": "Snapdragon Mobile, Snapdragon Wear"}, "product_version": "IPQ4019, MDM9206, MDM9607, MDM9625, MDM9635M, MSM8909W, SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 400, SD 410/12, SD 600, SD 615/16/SD 415, SD 617, SD 650/52, SD 800, SD 808, SD 810"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4df36a89-8724-3ef7-9698-336443656b50", "vendor": {"name": "Qualcomm, Inc."}}], "isExploited": false}
