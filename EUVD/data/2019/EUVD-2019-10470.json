The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input and improper boundary checks when reading data into an internal buffer. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious requests to the web management interface of an affected device. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious requests must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS.", "datePublished": "2019-08-07T05:50:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:02:16", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1913", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190806-sb220-rce", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154667/Realtek-Managed-Switch-Controller-RTL83xx-Stack-Overflow.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1913"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 12.72, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aa8ae620-223a-3272-9a6b-324f0d797fe4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.1.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "653ec21e-79a5-31f9-9128-6de0352e2042", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
