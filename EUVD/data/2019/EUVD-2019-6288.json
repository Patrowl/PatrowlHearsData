The attacker must have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a troubleshooting file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:06:46", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-ise-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15281"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9ba01951-1f94-3e26-a8a2-c5ef66072249", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3bd592e3-ff07-32c1-b1ff-34201e3b1ddf", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
