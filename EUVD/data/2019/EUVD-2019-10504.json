The vulnerability is due to improper handling of email messages that contain large attachments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious email message through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition due to high CPU utilization. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to recover the ESA.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:26:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:05:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-esa-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1947"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a2567be-67f0-3eaa-982f-d5857539ffa0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e62834f1-28f2-374e-949d-b137f765647a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
