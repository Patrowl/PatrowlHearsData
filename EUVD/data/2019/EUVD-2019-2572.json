When entering new credentials to a site that isn't registered within this product, a pop-up window will appear asking the user if they want to save these new credentials. The code of the pop-up window can be read and, to some extent, manipulated by remote servers. This pop-up window will stay on any page the user visits within the browser until a decision is made. A malicious web server can forcefully manipulate the pop-up and cause it not to appear, stopping users from securing their credentials. This vulnerability is related to id=\"uniqkey-password-popup\" and password-popup/popup.html, but is a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-10676.", "datePublished": "2019-04-08T17:57:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:32:02", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Apr/8", "https://vuldb.com/?id.132960", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152452/Uniqkey-Password-Manager-1.14-Denial-Of-Service.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-10845"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "86940506-d31d-3bcb-8bfc-238d699e9090", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f14b786c-4fed-3cf0-b082-b2ba7660665c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
