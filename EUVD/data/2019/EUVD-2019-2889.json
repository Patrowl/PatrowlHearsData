This results from an incomplete patch for CVE-2018-12426. Arbitrary file upload is achieved by using a non-blacklisted executable file extension in conjunction with a whitelisted file extension, and prepending \"magic bytes\" to the payload to pass MIME checks. Specifically, an unauthenticated remote user submits a crafted file upload POST request to the REST api remote_upload endpoint. The file contains data that will fool the plugin's MIME check into classifying it as an image (which is a whitelisted file extension) and finally a trailing .phtml file extension.", "datePublished": "2019-06-03T20:34:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:48:08", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-live-chat-support/#developers", "https://wp-livechat.com/", "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9320"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-11185"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 6.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3863f115-cdbe-378f-97bd-ac78e7230d5a", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aabe7fa7-48e8-3dfa-86d6-a8092c71b575", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
