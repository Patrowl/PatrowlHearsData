The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specifically crafted XML payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition until the system is manually rebooted. Software versions prior to X12.5.1 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T00:20:31", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:39:34", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ces-tvcs-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108002"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1720"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "03ea1c6f-0fb7-3307-b62c-d7e0f6838667", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <X12.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a6e69194-306e-3b7f-a235-c526170a6628", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
