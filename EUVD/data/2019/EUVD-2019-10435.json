The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands or scripts on the targeted device.", "datePublished": "2019-06-20T03:05:34", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:16:32", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-tele-shell-inj", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108883"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1878"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "37a66fae-c9be-36d1-accc-524772d704a3", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence TC Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.7.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "275086ed-430c-37c2-9b4b-a2c4e3e350ac", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
