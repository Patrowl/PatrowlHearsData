The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the URL for device disconnection and providing the connected device information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deny service to specific clients that are connected to the guest network.", "datePublished": "2019-06-20T03:05:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:05:23", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-rv-dos", "https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2019-29", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108848"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1897"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 5.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "54be8f12-d78e-3c92-91f6-60342dd4beb6", "product": {"name": "Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.3.51"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "804609d9-4ec6-3f47-b6a8-0721d5f60efe", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
