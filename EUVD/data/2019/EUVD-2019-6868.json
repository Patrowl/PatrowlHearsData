The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the user to a specific malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:27:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:03:26", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-msa-open-redirect"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15974"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "13d34cfa-eb25-347c-ae58-50cab0c809d8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Managed Services Accelerator"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9a818720-0896-3c58-a0de-f3ef2eae98cd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
