The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request for the affected web interface and injecting malicious code into that request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web-based management interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:26:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:04:58", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-er-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16025"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fbe19d20-759f-3218-a601-22078a1460ff", "product": {"name": "Cisco Emergency Responder"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "512a2fc9-e5a8-3f7e-b8cb-e714654f297d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
