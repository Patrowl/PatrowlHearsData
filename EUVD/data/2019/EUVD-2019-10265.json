The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of certain MOBIKE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MOBIKE packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The MOBIKE feature is supported only for IPv4 addresses.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:10:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:08:55", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-ike-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108166"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1708"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.94, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "52ae7ee5-d193-3d50-9d5b-1f13a39b8e6d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.10.1.17"}, {"id": "601f9b92-e474-38a3-9b34-e2882ddd20d7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.8.4"}, {"id": "7ae2715c-c6fc-373b-90ff-7f2bb2d73254", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.3.0.3"}, {"id": "b43a523d-a3fb-33a4-bb6b-8959a86dedf9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.9.2.50"}, {"id": "ecd15db3-9825-326f-913f-c2b9143f2c87", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.2.3.12"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e701770a-40a8-369d-8ca3-289d46ed2da3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
