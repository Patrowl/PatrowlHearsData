The vulnerability is due to excessive use of system resources when the affected device is logging a drop action for received MODE_PRIVATE (Mode 7) NTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding the device with a steady stream of Mode 7 NTP packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU and memory usage on the affected device, which could cause internal system processes to restart or cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload. Note: The NTP feature is enabled by default.", "datePublished": "2019-08-29T21:45:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:58:07", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-ntp-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1967"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.57, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "799a1c48-38ef-3e22-a07f-74b0abb73f03", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(2)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "081fb680-e1b1-39d1-a573-d27e9019c584", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
