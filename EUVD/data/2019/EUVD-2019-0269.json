This causes potential SQL injection in sequelize 3.19.3 and earlier, where a malicious user could put `[\"test\", \"'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')\"]` inside of ``` database.query('SELECT * FROM TestTable WHERE Name IN (:names)', { replacements: { names: directCopyOfUserInput } }); ``` and cause the SQL statement to become `SELECT Id FROM Table WHERE Name IN ('test', '\\'); DELETE TestTable WHERE Id = 1 --')`. In Postgres, MSSQL, and SQLite, the backslash has no special meaning. This causes the the statement to delete whichever Id has a value of 1 in the TestTable table.", "datePublished": "2018-05-29T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T03:47:51", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10556", "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5671", "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/commit/23952a2b020cc3571f090e67dae7feb084e1be71", "https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/commits/v3.20.0?after=62e4dacb28a779a190a3e042b971dcd8c7926e49+34&branch=v3.20.0&qualified_name=refs%2Ftags%2Fv3.20.0", "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/102"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10556", "GHSA-9c2p-jw8p-f84v"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4f33d3e-78ed-30db-bd1f-f6cd3491bc5a", "product": {"name": "sequelize node module"}, "product_version": "\u22643.19.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c8ecf1f8-8e03-3545-a6d1-2584fa34ba82", "vendor": {"name": "HackerOne"}}], "isExploited": false}
