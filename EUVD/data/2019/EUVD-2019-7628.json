If a user does not have direct access to the elevation feature through group policies, they are prompted to enter a PIN code in a challenge-response manner upon attempting to elevate privileges. The challenge's response uses a simple algorithm that can be easily emulated via data (customer ID and device name) available to all users, and thus any user can elevate to Administrator privilege.", "datePublished": "2020-01-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:33:17", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AC:L/AV:L/A:N/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:C/UI:R", "references": ["https://improsec.com/en/responsible-disclosure", "https://www.adminbyrequest.com/en/releasenotes"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-17202"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "30d55bf1-c9b1-3b71-9c80-65b0974ad121", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f740dedf-d518-31c7-ace4-3d36963d229e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
