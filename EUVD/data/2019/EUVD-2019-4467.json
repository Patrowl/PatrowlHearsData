A user with local access to only the Windows logon screen can escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\System. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit. The attacker must disconnect the computer from the local network / WAN and connect it to an internet facing access point / network. At that point, the attacker can execute the password-reset functionality, which will expose a web browser. Browsing to a site that calls local Windows system functions (e.g., file upload) will expose the local file system. From there an attacker can launch a privileged command shell.", "datePublished": "2019-08-20T12:00:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:32:55", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/nulsect0r/CVE-2019-12889"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12889"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "501cc596-13ea-39ba-bc97-4d42feaed6ed", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c9ccace9-a1fd-39c7-991e-d09a86df614d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
