The device uses a custom UDP protocol to start and control video and audio services. The protocol has been partially reverse engineered. Based upon the reverse engineering, no password or username is ever transferred over this protocol. Thus, one can set up the camera connection feed with only the encoded UID. It is possible to set up sessions with the camera over the Internet by using the encoded UID and the custom UDP protocol, because authentication happens at the client side.", "datePublished": "2024-11-07T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2025-11-04T17:12:03", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.alecto.nl", "https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jul/14", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-20461", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2024/Jul/14"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-20461"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.07, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69d78ef5-3e20-3a58-ba2f-862393dc4bec", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "018c5a38-fab0-35b3-9431-0ee2fea41e90", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
