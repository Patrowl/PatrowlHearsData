The vulnerability is due to improper signature verification during the installation of an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image. An authenticated, local attacker could exploit this vulnerability and load a malicious, unsigned OVA image on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to perform code execution on a crafted software OVA image.", "datePublished": "2019-09-25T20:16:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:09:50", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-vman"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12662"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e4656c04-854a-3d50-a6c8-db1969428bda", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software 6.0(2)A1(1)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "67f69f1b-6d9a-3cd2-bbe2-bb70beed074a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
