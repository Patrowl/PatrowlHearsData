This issue is exploitable only during the installation of the product by an administrator. A local authenticated low privileged user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by staging a malicious DLL in the search path of the installer prior to its execution by a local administrator. This would cause loading of the malicious DLL, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.", "datePublished": "2019-10-07T18:21:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T04:14:02", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318889"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-3745"], "assigner": "dell", "epss": 0.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1e4ff90d-05f0-3020-8029-6544ca1320b2", "product": {"name": "Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.4.0"}, {"id": "8943dd6b-0825-34e8-9206-4ecd21696c8e", "product": {"name": "Dell Encryption Enterprise"}, "product_version": "unspecified <10.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1045cc3e-165f-30c8-9c30-bba15ebd1bf1", "vendor": {"name": "Dell"}}], "isExploited": false}
