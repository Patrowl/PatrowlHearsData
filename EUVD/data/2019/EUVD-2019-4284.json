The vulnerability is due to the use of an incorrect data type for a length variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating the transfer of a large file to an affected device via SCP. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid privilege level 15 credentials on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the length variable to roll over, which could cause the affected device to crash.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:46", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:12:21", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-scp-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12693"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8048cf7f-ef7c-3080-862e-9437302022ac", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c6f90139-53db-3d7f-a345-64af89bcc24e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
