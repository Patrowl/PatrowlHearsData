The vulnerability exists because, under certain circumstances, an affected device can be configured to not verify the digital signatures of system image files during the boot process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by abusing a specific feature that is part of the device boot process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries on the targeted device.", "datePublished": "2019-09-25T20:05:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:10:35", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-iosxe-digsig-bypass"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12649"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "40875e4f-2d89-3270-a808-d4b2bc1b6f77", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software 3.2.11aSG"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cb2a4ef3-4bff-395a-a72c-40b9fb618407", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
