This issue affects PAN-OS 9.0 versions prior to 9.0.5-h3 on PA-7080 and PA-7050 devices with an LFC installed and configured. This issue does not affect PA-7000 Series deployments using the first-generation SMC and the Log Processing Card (LPC). This issue does not affect any other PA series devices. This issue does not affect devices without an LFC. This issue does not affect PAN-OS 8.1 or prior releases. This issue only affected a very limited number of customers and we undertook individual outreach to help them upgrade. At the time of publication, all identified customers have upgraded SW or content and are not impacted.", "datePublished": "2019-12-20T15:22:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:56:43", "baseScore": 10.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2019-17440"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-17440"], "assigner": "palo_alto", "epss": 0.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "741a7d5b-2cac-3745-ae94-3a7ffd4351e7", "product": {"name": "PAN-OS"}, "product_version": "9.0 <9.0.5-h3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0b0dea8e-a391-3c29-bcca-a8d17f8ab23a", "vendor": {"name": "Palo Alto Networks"}}], "isExploited": false}
