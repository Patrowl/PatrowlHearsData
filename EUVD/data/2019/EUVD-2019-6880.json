To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation for certain CLI commands that are executed on a vulnerable system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system and sending crafted CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:42:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:04:00", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-unity-exp-comm-inject"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15986"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b7886381-c7b9-3fe3-951f-ea91f8eafd73", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unity Express"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3592acec-1dd7-38a5-8ae4-f8858169fec5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
