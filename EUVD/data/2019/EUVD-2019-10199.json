The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-23T23:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:48:06", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1642", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46263/", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106714", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-frpwr-mc-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1642"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.01, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7069ded5-dc84-3123-b09b-7141c8aa5a19", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "68601432-c0bd-3149-ab54-3ea0490dce43", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
