Manual intervention may be required before a device will resume normal operations. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the FPGA related to the processing of different types of input packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by being on the adjacent subnet and sending a crafted sequence of input packets to a specific interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a queue wedge condition on the interface. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop processing any additional packets that are received on the wedged interface. Version 2.2 is affected.", "datePublished": "2019-02-21T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:44:39", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107105", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-firpwr-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1700"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f2391b1e-8449-3edf-9a22-7bc33c5d0645", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Extensible Operating System (FXOS)"}, "product_version": "2.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c0b00056-68b8-3a3d-a29c-2dc622909920", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
