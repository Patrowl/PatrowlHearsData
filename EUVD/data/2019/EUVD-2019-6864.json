The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script or HTML code in the context of the interface, which could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:27:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:03:17", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-wsa-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15969"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f9971676-35dd-3613-bf72-7d1fce6780b1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ca56afc1-6fbd-3f08-b0b2-168018b06969", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
