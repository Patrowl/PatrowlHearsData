The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on the allowed Lua function calls within the context of user-supplied Lua scripts. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a heap overflow condition and execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of an affected device.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:27:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:47:14", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191112-asa-ftd-lua-rce"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15992"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 5.02, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f5958c38-b4ab-3329-b25e-3f0d09f3aad7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d2142672-d970-338d-971c-bfd9f22d3c02", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
