{"id": "EUVD-2019-6907", "enisaUuid": "64483f39-abdc-3bd8-9ce7-9befe1417135", "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Ethernet VPN (EVPN) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains crafted EVPN attributes. An attacker could indirectly exploit the vulnerability by sending BGP EVPN update messages with a specific, malformed attribute to an affected system and waiting for a user on the device to display the EVPN operational routes&rsquo; status. If successful, the attacker could cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer, or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim's BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:30:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:46:42", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-routes"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16018"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d3533bd-b07e-318d-8297-402f562eeca3", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "32d69c6c-323b-3321-9fd1-cf07607ebe40", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
