The cgi-bin/webfile_mgr.cgi file allows arbitrary file write by abusing symlinks. Specifically, this occurs by uploading a tar archive that contains a symbolic link, then uploading another archive that writes a file to the link using the \"cgi_untar\" command. Other commands might also be susceptible. Code can be executed because the \"name\" parameter passed to the cgi_unzip command is not sanitized.", "datePublished": "2019-05-23T13:22:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:10:08", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://community.wd.com/t/new-release-my-cloud-firmware-versions-2-31-183-05-20-2019/237717", "https://bnbdr.github.io/posts/wd/", "https://github.com/bnbdr/wd-rce/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-9949"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b96f989c-a1ae-366a-a81f-1601e3e0fae3", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70589818-b58d-3403-b370-4b3d008529ce", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
