The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:09:38", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-ise-store-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12638"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "304a3dcd-c978-39a5-9ba4-a60aa8c4102a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a89bed3-1f72-328b-8fcb-c4068ecd65f3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
