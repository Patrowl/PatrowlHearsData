The pre-installed Email application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. An attacker can send a specially crafted email to the victim that will inject HTML into the email application's UI as soon as the email is opened. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Email application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter their email credentials) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.", "datePublished": "2020-09-14T18:32:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:38", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/21/technical-advisory-multiple-html-injection-vulnerabilities-in-kaios-pre-installed-mobile-applications/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14756"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "eb438cc0-e8ac-35b5-b8a4-598196b1f5ae", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "42057999-2600-3bb2-b808-c50a78079324", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
