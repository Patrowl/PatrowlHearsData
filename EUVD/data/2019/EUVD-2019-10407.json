An attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker with elevated privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the administrative web management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary, system-level commands with root privileges on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:10:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:12:38", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imc-cmdinj-1850"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1850"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "43226dc7-893f-3d00-ab2b-74307ead8814", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Software (UCSE)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0(4k)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "747f8b3a-b8f0-3ba4-96ff-378f04411c40", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
