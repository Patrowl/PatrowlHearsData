When Squid is parsing ESI, it keeps the ESI elements in ESIContext. ESIContext contains a buffer for holding a stack of ESIElements. When a new ESIElement is parsed, it is added via addStackElement. addStackElement has a check for the number of elements in this buffer, but it's off by 1, leading to a Heap Overflow of 1 element. The overflow is within the same structure so it can't affect adjacent memory blocks, and thus just leads to a crash while processing.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T18:47:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:24:38", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-12521.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4682", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4743", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-12521", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-12521", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2019-12521.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-12521.html", "https://gitlab.com/jeriko.one/security/-/blob/master/squid/CVEs/CVE-2019-12521.txt", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/23/1", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00018.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-05", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4356-1/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/07/msg00009.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12521"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "35a6ba25-7a38-3838-98f7-cdb99c002001", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d26ec763-74d4-3dbd-b987-b18dbd796799", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
