The vulnerability is due to overly permissive file permissions of specific system files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device, creating a crafted command string, and writing this crafted string to a specific file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials for the device.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:20:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:23:36", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-nexus9k-rpe"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1803"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34d72227-9bdf-38e3-a0fa-ce9397982c8c", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches ACI Mode"}, "product_version": "unspecified <14.1(1i)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26a7014d-eea3-3c7a-90b3-eb668a8c1053", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
