The vulnerability is due to improper validation of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)-encoded variables in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to the SNMP daemon on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2019-08-28T18:50:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:15:22", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-fxnxos-snmp-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1963"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c80b7a0-60d0-3a24-be95-af3f5d3e8af7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.4(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "aa7976f5-b9f9-34d3-bb62-db241a217252", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
