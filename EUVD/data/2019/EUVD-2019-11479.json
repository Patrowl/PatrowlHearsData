Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.", "datePublished": "2021-05-26T18:45:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T03:00:18", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://hackerone.com/reports/1168198"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-25029"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 2.41, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e1f63d02-a15e-34f6-978f-55585a260cf6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
