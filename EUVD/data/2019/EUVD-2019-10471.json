The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web management interface. To send the malicious request, the attacker needs a valid login session in the web management interface as a privilege level 15 user. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user.", "datePublished": "2019-08-07T05:50:11", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:14:57", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1914", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190806-sb220-inject", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154667/Realtek-Managed-Switch-Controller-RTL83xx-Stack-Overflow.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1914"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e508a4f9-74a3-3a67-80ca-abc9931ac365", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.1.4.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8f2b9dee-3e47-3f80-9d64-bff60e6341d7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
