The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user. RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-02-28T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:16:07", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1663", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107185", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190227-rmi-cmd-ex", "http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/http/cisco_rv130_rmi_rce", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152507/Cisco-RV130W-Routers-Management-Interface-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46705/", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153163/Cisco-RV130W-1.0.3.44-Remote-Stack-Overflow.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154310/Cisco-RV110W-RV130-W-RV215W-Remote-Command-Execution.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1663"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 86.93, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "083244e8-7a61-3312-b3d6-8867cb0b4bef", "product": {"name": "RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.0.3.45"}, {"id": "4aaaa525-7a28-39e3-88ba-e3b221de1ae1", "product": {"name": "RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.2.2.1"}, {"id": "a3224272-3eac-3cfa-9b97-4146267d151e", "product": {"name": "RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.3.1.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a64b1545-2f2b-36df-8b82-77de65ed0e5d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
