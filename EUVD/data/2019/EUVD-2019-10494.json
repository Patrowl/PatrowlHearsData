The vulnerability is due to insufficient request header validation during the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious requests to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to use the acquired session token to gain full administrator access to the affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:25:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:52:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1937", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imcs-ucs-authby", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/49", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154239/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-Authentication-Bypass-Command-Injection.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/36", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154308/Cisco-UCS-Director-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/173531/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-2.2.0.0-Authentication-Bypass.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1937"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 90.9, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3c2557bc-1fb3-33ac-8de5-4fdff8defd3c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.7.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2583dfdc-d6e0-39ca-aee3-f31cbb5b2c23", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
