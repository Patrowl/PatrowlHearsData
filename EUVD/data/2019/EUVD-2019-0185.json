{"id": "EUVD-2019-0185", "enisaUuid": "52b3604a-16ed-3b80-a99b-6af8ecd9217e", "description": "In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires authentication to access it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.", "datePublished": "2018-09-18T14:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T02:16:58", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11787", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cq9c-55r7-455x", "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KARAF-4993", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d9ba4c3104ba32225646879a057b75b54430f349c246c85469037d3c@%3Cdev.karaf.apache.org%3E", "http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2018-11787.txt", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d9ba4c3104ba32225646879a057b75b54430f349c246c85469037d3c%40%3Cdev.karaf.apache.org%3E"], "aliases": ["CVE-2018-11787", "GHSA-cq9c-55r7-455x"], "assigner": "apache", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "94b07eb4-15f4-35fb-9cb5-ade4b5175f06", "product": {"name": "Apache Karaf"}, "product_version": "4.0.x prior to 4.0.9"}, {"id": "d6082034-9a77-31a4-888a-f16a46dff938", "product": {"name": "Apache Karaf"}, "product_version": "4.1.x prior to 4.1.1"}, {"id": "e0e915a6-de81-302c-9448-a9c129ad7f59", "product": {"name": "Apache Karaf"}, "product_version": "prior to 3.0.9"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a3ae62ed-4f58-3edb-8ac7-8307e4b99ba1", "vendor": {"name": "Apache Software Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
