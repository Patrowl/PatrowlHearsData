To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious DLL file would execute when the vulnerable application is launched. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another user account.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:41:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:05:00", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-webex-teams-dll"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16001"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c0f3aea3-3170-3129-a112-2b8d7cddaf59", "product": {"name": "Cisco Webex Teams"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a8cb99fe-a61f-33f8-a5e4-9ae429733393", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
