The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of the LLDP frame header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit may lead to a buffer overflow condition that could either cause a DoS condition or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Note: This vulnerability cannot be exploited by transit traffic through the device; the crafted packet must be targeted to a directly connected interface. This vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode if they are running a Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch Software release prior to 13.2(7f) or any 14.x release.", "datePublished": "2019-07-31T17:25:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:15:07", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190731-nxos-bo"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1901"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "314b27ab-451c-3d5a-bbfd-046c595f3f3d", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS System Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <13.2(7f)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e766da1e-87e0-30ec-9a86-21ce0ad4d19c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
