The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control mechanisms for IPv6 link-local connectivity imposed on the management interface of an affected device. An attacker on the same physical network could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the IPv6 link-local address on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass default access control restrictions on an affected device. Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices running versions prior to 4.2(0.21c) are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-03-11T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:42:40", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107317", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-apic-ipv6"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1690"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4d57d4f3-a844-35e3-9023-d66cac161b3b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.2(0.21c)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "23510927-cca6-3801-b94e-4d4cdf1957bc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
