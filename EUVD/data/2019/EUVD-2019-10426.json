The vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur under specific traffic conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent the targeted service interface from receiving any traffic, which would lead to a DoS condition on the affected interface. The device may have to be manually reloaded to recover from exploitation of this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-06-20T02:55:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:05:58", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-staros-asr-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108853"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1869"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b500da9d-fc89-39fc-9ae9-9a647d080e18", "product": {"name": "Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <21.11.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "47156939-64e5-31f7-9305-5f5958bb2edc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
