The vulnerability is due to improper authorization controls for a specific URL in the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could have a twofold impact: the attacker could either change the administrator password, gaining privileged access, or reset the network configuration details, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. In both scenarios, manual intervention is required to restore normal operations.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:11:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:04:44", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-wsa-unauth-devreset"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15956"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b3898de7-1f20-37f4-b253-ba7569d0e526", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e9c4fc66-370f-36b1-9dff-3458f94a14c7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
