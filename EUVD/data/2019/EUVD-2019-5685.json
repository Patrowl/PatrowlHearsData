When using the default configuration, the LAN Cache feature creates a local account FSAdminxxxxxxxxx (e.g., FSAdmin123456789) on the server that hosts the LAN Cache and all clients that are assigned to a LAN Cache. This account is placed into the local Administrators group of all clients assigned to the LAN Cache. When the assigned client is a Domain Controller, the FSAdminxxxxxxxxx account is created as a domain account and automatically added as a member of the domain BUILTIN\\Administrators group. Using the well known Pass-the-Hash techniques, an attacker can use the same FSAdminxxxxxxxxx hash from any LAN Cache client and pass this to a Domain Controller, providing administrative rights to the attacker on any Domain Controller. (Local account Pass-the-Hash mitigations do not protect domain accounts.)", "datePublished": "2019-10-11T11:44:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:19:41", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.kaseya.com/products/vsa/", "http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355.aspx", "https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin/", "https://lockstepgroup.com/blog/cve-2019-14510-abusing-the-kaseya-lan-cache-fsadmin-red-team-edition/", "http://community.kaseya.com/xsp/f/355/t/24675.aspx"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14510"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3cc20ef1-93c5-3bd9-a9bb-ff6a16a6b24f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c71d0c7d-115c-323c-a46a-d7068ec09529", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
