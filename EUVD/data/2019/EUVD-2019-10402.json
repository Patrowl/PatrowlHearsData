The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls for specific memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) authentication request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the authentication service, preventing users from successfully authenticating. Exploitation of this vulnerability does not impact users who were authenticated prior to an attack.", "datePublished": "2019-06-05T16:25:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:06:26", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-cucm-imp-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108615"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1845"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 9.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d2567150-0ada-3e18-b54e-96facd731a44", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.5(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9727ece8-5a4c-33b5-8fb3-ae311feaea77", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
