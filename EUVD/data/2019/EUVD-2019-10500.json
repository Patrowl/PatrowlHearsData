The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a user's HTTP request and modifying it into a request that causes the web interface to redirect the user to a specific malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.", "datePublished": "2019-07-17T20:30:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:18:29", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1943", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190717-sbss-redirect", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109288"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1943"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 22.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02ac3745-fc25-34be-a4bd-fad1fb969ae5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "1.3.7.18"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fd5ee06f-4535-3eaf-b863-811fe020714a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
