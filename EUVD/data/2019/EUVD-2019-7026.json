For example, a Move module author can enter the // sequence (which introduces a single-line comment), followed by very brief comment text, the \\r character, and code that has security-critical functionality. In many popular environments, this code is displayed on a separate line, and thus a reader may infer that the code is executed. However, the code is NOT executed, because language/compiler/ir_to_bytecode/src/parser.rs allows the comment to continue after the \\r character.", "datePublished": "2019-09-11T03:51:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:10:41", "baseScore": 5.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-summary/", "https://blog.openzeppelin.com/libra-vulnerability-release/", "https://github.com/libra/libra/commit/7efb0221989f17fdf7f8486730898ed947a1e19e"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16214"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "275b589c-4073-3183-9e6d-a2f51c4bd54e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ec59f046-6704-3c90-b6d2-f7bd30f0409d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
