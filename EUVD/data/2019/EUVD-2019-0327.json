A malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application 2.2.13 and earlier is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. This vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response.", "datePublished": "2018-05-31T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:03:05", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10532", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q52j-4q2q-hcj6", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/90", "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/90"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10532", "GHSA-q52j-4q2q-hcj6"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f8b24adc-8942-3123-9f27-dc1c2cab3416", "product": {"name": "console-io node module"}, "product_version": "\u22642.2.13"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c859270b-7e0b-3281-821d-818a39be8f6d", "vendor": {"name": "HackerOne"}}], "isExploited": false}
