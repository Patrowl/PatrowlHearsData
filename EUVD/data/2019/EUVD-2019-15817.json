A v2_decoder.cpp zmq::v2_decoder_t::size_ready integer overflow allows an authenticated attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of bytes beyond the bounds of a buffer, which can be leveraged to run arbitrary code on the target system. The memory layout allows the attacker to inject OS commands into a data structure located immediately after the problematic buffer (i.e., it is not necessary to use a typical buffer-overflow exploitation technique that changes the flow of control).", "datePublished": "2019-01-13T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T20:16:24", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-6250.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4368", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-6250.html", "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3351", "https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.1", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-22"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-6250"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 28.55, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4c3d2b9e-1ca9-347e-9416-620760a7fc6d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1a90d06f-0688-3b39-9523-b4c282b2132f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
