This could result in script running where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript.", "datePublished": "2019-12-20T15:07:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:32:10", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/MIME-Confusion-Attack-on-Midori-Browser/blob/master/README.md", "https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2016/08/26/mitigating-mime-confusion-attacks-in-firefox/", "https://portswigger.net/research/bypassing-csp-using-polyglot-jpegs"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-19916"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "68c7613a-c9b7-32a5-a91e-ef2775c3f584", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "19b374f8-a524-3d40-a3f8-d4e957b08724", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
