{"id": "EUVD-2019-6250", "enisaUuid": "ba6b1b3b-6c3c-3f47-85b4-c22d715f58d2", "description": "In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp_output.c change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. NOTE: this affects (for example) Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.190 or 4.14.x longterm kernels before 4.14.139.", "datePublished": "2019-08-20T07:25:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:42:04", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15239.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4497", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0027", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3979", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3978", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-15239.html", "https://pulsesecurity.co.nz/advisories/linux-kernel-4.9-tcpsocketsuaf", "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7f582b248d0a86bae5788c548d7bb5bca6f7691a", "https://lore.kernel.org/stable/41a61a2f87691d2bc839f26cdfe6f5ff2f51e472.camel%40decadent.org.uk/", "https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/kernel-sec/blob/f6273af2d956a87296b6b60379d0a186c9be4bbc/active/CVE-2019-15239", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00064.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00066.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15239"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "97aeae19-717a-3599-a38c-df7a819454d1", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7382ebee-2653-3f82-9a12-a2c155d16c1f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
