Pods with permission to access the host network, running on master nodes, can retrieve security credentials for the master AWS IAM role, allowing management access to AWS resources. With access to the security credentials, the user then has access to the entire infrastructure. Impact to data and system availability is high.", "datePublished": "2021-03-19T20:28:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:17:19", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1730161", "https://github.com/openshift/cluster-kube-apiserver-operator/pull/524"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-10200"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "84850092-cbd8-3f39-9195-e1ecdb1f9bbd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
