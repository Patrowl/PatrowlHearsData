These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient protections on the underlying filesystem. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by modifying critical files on the underlying filesystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges within the host namespace. This could allow the attacker to impact other running FTD instances.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:08:49", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-ftd-container-esc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12675"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f61378a0-363b-3d4c-a10d-cbe4df195e24", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6ea41a26-4844-32e3-bc2f-3e616716fb3f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
