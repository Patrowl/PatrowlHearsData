The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or by intercepting a user request on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning, access sensitive browser-based information, and similar exploits.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:10:32", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-uccx-http"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15259"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.21, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "baacb903-9a2e-3648-843f-2232a8f151e2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0fbb7e25-5019-3d3c-91fb-0a706009a2cd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
