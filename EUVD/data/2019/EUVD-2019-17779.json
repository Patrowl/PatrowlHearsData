By default, the application runs a transfer service on port 8080, accessible by everyone on the same Wi-Fi network. An attacker can send the POST parameters downfiles and cur-folder (with a crafted ../ payload) to the download.script endpoint. This will create a MusicPlayerArchive.zip archive that is publicly accessible and includes the content of any requested file (such as the /etc/passwd file).", "datePublished": "2019-02-17T03:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T21:17:31", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://gist.github.com/shawarkhanethicalhacker/b98c5ac7491cf77732c793ecc468f465"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-8389"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 4.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fe0c19c2-2e0d-3180-a773-2bdfa19a62b0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "08b917a2-c39c-305f-9eff-52e453962392", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
