The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking by the import-config process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to implement arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:15:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:12:13", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imc-bo"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1871"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a17e68d0-320b-3cb8-8a0b-752fcbb3d626", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Management Software)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0(4k)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d001ea7e-bad0-319c-8052-8e5a38c9f313", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
