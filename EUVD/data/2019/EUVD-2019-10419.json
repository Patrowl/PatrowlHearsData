The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted input parameter on a form in the Web UI and then submitting that form. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.", "datePublished": "2019-05-13T19:15:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:22:53", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190513-webui", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/400865", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108331"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1862"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8a7c1ff2-81ad-3a49-8953-957bf8cfa6d4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "3.2.0JA"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8df57a70-dfec-3914-9a82-5eb5256353ac", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
