This vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of role-based access control (RBAC). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific HTTP request with administrative credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a certificate that is signed and trusted by the ISE CA with arbitrary attributes. The attacker could use this certificate to access other networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.", "datePublished": "2019-05-16T01:20:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:24:02", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-ise-certcreation", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108356"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1851"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e7c9ab31-5e6f-30fb-a40d-609ad599476a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7dbc215e-6bf3-3c61-9c55-6e6640e28bd9", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
