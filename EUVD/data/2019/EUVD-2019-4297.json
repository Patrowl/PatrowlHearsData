The vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates certain incoming SPF messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a custom SPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured header filters, which could allow malicious content to pass through the device.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:50", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:53:34", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-esa-bypass"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12706"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.39, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "229caaaa-4d9e-38ae-a9b2-4be42c38ffa4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "61d818c3-2900-39af-9b21-6749ed81d0d6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
