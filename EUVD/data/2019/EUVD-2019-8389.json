The power consumption of each row-based display cycle depends on the number of illuminated pixels, allowing a partial recovery of display contents. For example, a hardware implant in the USB cable might be able to leverage this behavior to recover confidential secrets such as the PIN and BIP39 mnemonic. Note: BIP39 secrets are not displayed by default on this device. The side channel is relevant only if the attacker has enough control over the device's USB connection to make power-consumption measurements at a time when secret data is displayed. The side channel is not relevant in other circumstances, such as a stolen device that is not currently displaying secret data.", "datePublished": "2019-11-02T16:25:42", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:54:14", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://blog.inhq.net/posts/oled-side-channel-status-summary/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-18673"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4a432ad1-b873-3f83-82bb-364af0875b9f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2755dd3c-3141-34d2-9bf9-4cac8bf50a8f", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
