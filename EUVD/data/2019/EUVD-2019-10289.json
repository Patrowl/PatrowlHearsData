The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper locking mechanism on critical variables that need to stay static until used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a set of RPM-related CLI commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary command injection. The attacker would need administrator credentials for the targeted device.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T16:50:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:22:27", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-rpm-injec", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108361"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1732"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8438581a-0621-3320-aa0a-961d4d8f75d4", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "48e1cc22-8336-38a7-8978-2c1abc062421", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
