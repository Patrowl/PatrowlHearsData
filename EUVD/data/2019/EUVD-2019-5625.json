The Tsvncmd: URI handler allows a customised diff operation on Excel workbooks, which could be used to open remote workbooks without protection from macro security settings to execute arbitrary code. A tsvncmd:command:diff?path:[file1]?path2:[file2] URI will execute a customised diff on [file1] and [file2] based on the file extension. For xls files, it will execute the script diff-xls.js using wscript, which will open the two files for analysis without any macro security warning. An attacker can exploit this by putting a macro virus in a network drive, and force the victim to open the workbooks and execute the macro inside.", "datePublished": "2019-08-15T16:02:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:19:41", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=2188", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/7"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14422"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "776a7b49-2ee6-3099-b7b0-1839226b1647", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "95339998-3154-3e6d-aaf1-9e0b9de686ab", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
