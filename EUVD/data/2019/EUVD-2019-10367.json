The vulnerability exists because software digital signatures are not properly verified during CLI command execution. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to install an unsigned software image on an affected device. Note: If the device has not been patched for the vulnerability previously disclosed in the Cisco Security Advisory cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software image.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T22:15:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:19:45", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-sisv", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108431"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1810"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0afdd05f-879e-3b14-9903-4180ad1d9033", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6de690b4-4fd4-315e-b5d8-279d38df2c10", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
