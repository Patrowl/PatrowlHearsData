The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient permission enforcement. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating as the remote support user and submitting malicious input to specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying filesystem. The attacker has no control over the contents of the data written to the file. Overwriting a critical file could cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition (DoS).", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:07:09", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-tele-ce-file-ovrwrt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15273"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "02b20060-8451-392e-8ece-40693e55b45f", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence TC Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3d8081cb-2afa-32b0-a643-25f74732702b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
