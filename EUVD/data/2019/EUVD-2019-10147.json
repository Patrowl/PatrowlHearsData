The vulnerability is due to insufficient TLS client certificate validations for certificates sent between the various components of an ACI fabric. An attacker who has possession of a certificate that is trusted by the Cisco Manufacturing CA and the corresponding private key could exploit this vulnerability by presenting a valid certificate while attempting to connect to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain full control of all other components within the ACI fabric of an affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T14:50:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:24:03", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-aci-insecure-fabric"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1590"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.68, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "29587347-eeb2-3f27-abb5-80815e40bc45", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches ACI Mode"}, "product_version": "unspecified <14.1(1i)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "54f32b09-976e-3be8-b3bf-050804173157", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
