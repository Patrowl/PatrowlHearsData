The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied commands. An attacker who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:10:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:12:22", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imc-cmdinject-1634"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1634"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f8b9a575-1817-3860-9af0-2fa971f44bdf", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Software (UCSE)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.0(13o)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fe64b386-3a4c-387d-891c-6741bdf3ac19", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
