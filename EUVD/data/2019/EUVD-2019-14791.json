An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file.At 0x1eb9c the extracted interface element name from the xml file is used as an argument to /etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=<contents of interface element> using sprintf(). The destination buffer sp+0x40 is overflowed with the call to sprintf() for any interface values that are greater than 512-len(\"/etc/config-tools/config_interfaces interface=\") in length. Later, at 0x1ea08 strcpy() is used to copy the contents of the stack buffer that was overflowed sp+0x40 into sp+0x440. The buffer sp+0x440 is immediately adjacent to sp+0x40 on the stack. Therefore, there is no NULL termination on the buffer sp+0x40 since it overflowed into sp+0x440. The strcpy() will result in invalid memory access. An interface value of length 0x3c4 will cause the service to crash.", "datePublished": "2020-03-23T13:19:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T19:47:56", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0966"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-5186"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "937aa4df-77f5-3b58-aaa4-5c2d6d4b0603", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
