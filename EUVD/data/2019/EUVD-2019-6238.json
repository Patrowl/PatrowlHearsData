The implementation in versions 1.10.0 through 1.11.1 for HTTP/1.x traffic and all versions of Envoy for HTTP/2 traffic had O(n^2) performance characteristics. A remote attacker may craft a request that stays below the maximum request header size but consists of many thousands of small headers to consume CPU and result in a denial-of-service attack.", "datePublished": "2019-10-09T15:25:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:42:01", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commits/master", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/commit/afc39bea36fd436e54262f150c009e8d72db5014", "https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/8520"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15226"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 16.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ea3fdaf3-211c-3ecd-b870-dee04a4ce0c2", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "27c94824-08f9-36bd-80b1-7f297ab94257", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
