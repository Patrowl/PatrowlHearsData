This could lead to different denial of service scenarios, either by causing CAM table attacks, or by leading to traffic flapping if faking already existing clients in other nearby Aps of the same wireless infrastructure. An attacker can forge Authentication and Association Request packets to trigger this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-12-12T21:36:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T19:47:55", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-5061.html", "https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2019-0849"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-5061"], "assigner": "talos", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f7a909c2-dd71-33ec-94f4-370194add8d0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
