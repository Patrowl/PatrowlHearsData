{"id": "EUVD-2019-10363", "enisaUuid": "ca6ff43a-3d86-351e-af65-68bfb63bfa48", "description": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco Small Business Sx200, Sx300, Sx500, ESW2 Series Managed Switches and Small Business Sx250, Sx350, Sx550 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application of an affected device to cease processing traffic, resulting in the CPU utilization reaching one hundred percent. Manual intervention may be required before a device resumes normal operations. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to cease forwarding traffic, which could result in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T21:45:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:26:01", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-sb-snmpdos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108335"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1806"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a4d41fcd-a000-3204-bcb6-3a0aa259df68", "product": {"name": "Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.5.0.78"}, {"id": "aa861c9a-7220-3a3e-9373-90c3721a049e", "product": {"name": "Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.4.10.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f0d31ba7-8dc8-3f4a-b074-669ade112e8b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
