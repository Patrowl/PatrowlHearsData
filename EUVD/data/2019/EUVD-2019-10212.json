The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-24T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:47:37", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106710", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-meetings-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1655"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8fdf215-11e5-34e8-8592-f6dfde6ca042", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx Meetings Server"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3ed0867-c1b7-3d02-94ee-e26b2a377951", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
