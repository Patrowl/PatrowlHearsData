The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default SSH key pair that is present in all devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening an SSH connection via IPv6 to a targeted device using the extracted key materials. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the system with the privileges of the root user. This vulnerability is only exploitable over IPv6; IPv4 is not vulnerable.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:25:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:08:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-nexus9k-sshkey"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1804"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 7.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8cc780cf-f89b-3792-aea6-b68dacaf0159", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches ACI Mode 11.0.1b"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5369507b-d90d-3a53-a747-1219abd90c26", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
