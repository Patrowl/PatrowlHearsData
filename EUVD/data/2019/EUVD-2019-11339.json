The application's file-transfer web server improperly displays directory names, leading to Stored XSS, which may be used to steal a user's data. This requires user interaction because there is no known direct way for an attacker to create a crafted directory name on a victim's device. However, a crafted directory name can occur if a victim extracts a ZIP archive that was provided by an attacker.", "datePublished": "2020-05-17T23:05:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:53:09", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://apps.apple.com/us/app/documents-by-readdle/id364901807", "https://logicaltrust.net/blog/2019/12/documents.html#xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-20802"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "920b4c80-672f-34e0-94cd-6b0501681813", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4dd2a472-957b-3fd4-b16c-b36569e25f15", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
