The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of authentication in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to the web-based management interface on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view limited configuration details and potentially upload a virtual machine image.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T07:20:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:01:55", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfvis-authbypass"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1946"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b731a119-c84a-3150-9537-6e19c085256f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6fdf2410-1d60-38b9-9e3e-ceec619385eb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
