The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation in the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to change or corrupt user account information which could grant the attacker administrator access or prevent legitimate user access to the web interface, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:31:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:46:00", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-on-prem-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16029"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.49, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4eccdb76-0e82-3f2d-8ad9-72a6366be8af", "product": {"name": "Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2de580c1-1bff-3ecb-9d0a-c59ba3c5c254", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
