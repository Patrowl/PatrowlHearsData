The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a report containing malicious content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Versions 6.2.3, 6.3.0, and 6.4.0 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T01:10:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:37:37", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-cfmc-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107995"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1802"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "10a87040-f6a0-392e-bb72-733dc4ab4838", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.3.0"}, {"id": "4683bdde-6626-367d-be15-9df95eaf1004", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.2.3"}, {"id": "918418b2-84f4-33b6-aae2-0071c1fb2c3f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "87b1925a-3db9-3d08-8fe0-f1b3bd99472d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
