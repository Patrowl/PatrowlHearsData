The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:12:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:04:21", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-webex-player"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15284"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61dbdc70-9680-3ec2-941d-d1549d1dd51a", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx WRF Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6d5be374-39cb-310d-8b47-eb57666aec2a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
