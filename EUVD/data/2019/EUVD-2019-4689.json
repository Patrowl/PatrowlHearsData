{"id": "EUVD-2019-4689", "enisaUuid": "3aa3a333-543c-35d2-8732-14613b72a7b2", "description": "An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source through 13.27.0, 14.x and 15.x through 15.7.2, and 16.x through 16.4.0, and Certified Asterisk through 13.21-cert3. A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling SDP negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an SDP answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request to them. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing both a T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec (which is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).", "datePublished": "2019-07-12T19:24:37", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:41:10", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://downloads.digium.com/pub/security/AST-2019-003.html", "https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-28465", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/11/msg00038.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00001.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13161"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4347eca0-d092-371b-8309-646cd82bbaee", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ff6c5c40-f4ad-33c0-97a1-e3f5ce78cc40", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
