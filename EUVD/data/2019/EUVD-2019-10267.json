The vulnerability is due to incorrect isolation of the secondary management interface from internal sysadmin applications. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to one of the listening internal applications. A successful exploit could result in unstable conditions, including both a denial of service and remote unauthenticated access to the device. This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software Release 6.5.3 and 7.0.1, which will edit the calvados_boostrap.cfg file and reload the device.", "datePublished": "2019-04-17T21:50:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:11:48", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-asr9k-exr", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108007"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1710"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.88, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "98aea155-a289-3105-af58-6a5d4cd041ed", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.5.3"}, {"id": "ce309402-9387-34a8-bcf9-12cc1d5f5c72", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <7.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "26ef89f0-2d4e-3385-a54b-d14a0ca51875", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
