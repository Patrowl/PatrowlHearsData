{"id": "EUVD-2019-10273", "enisaUuid": "ac5d9b73-9ac5-3ae5-835f-2e0b905256f3", "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Software for Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input during user authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device using HTTP and supplying malicious user credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition, or to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the app user. Cisco fixed this vulnerability in the following SIP Software releases: 10.3(1)SR5 and later for Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831; 11.0(4)SR3 and later for Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX; and 12.5(1)SR1 and later for the rest of the Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series.", "datePublished": "2019-03-22T20:05:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:14:27", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190320-ip-phone-rce"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1716"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 7.27, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1437a20b-c81f-3a40-a0ab-b74c92d2dab8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified IP Conference Phone 8831"}, "product_version": "unspecified <10.3(1)SR5"}, {"id": "46b3e2f8-15d2-33fd-94f4-a69e24be29d0", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX"}, "product_version": "unspecified <11.0(4)SR3"}, {"id": "6d84d1c1-e20b-3a2b-b7a3-8e8a37d85b31", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.5(1)SR1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "41cd3aba-a681-35a7-9409-32c09b98094d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
