The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific VMAN CLI command on an affected device. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges, which may lead to complete system compromise.", "datePublished": "2019-09-25T20:15:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:09:59", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-xr-asr9k-privesc"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12709"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a2605b7f-ad3b-3690-82c7-162fbdc3b5eb", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83b662de-57bb-3656-8acd-7b2c544dae75", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
