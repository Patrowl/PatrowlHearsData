The vulnerability is due to extraneous subcommand options present for a specific CLI command within the local-mgmt context. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device, entering the local-mgmt context, and issuing a specific CLI command and submitting user input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands as root on an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials for the device.", "datePublished": "2019-08-29T21:45:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:11:02", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-ucs-privescalation"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1966"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "34fcd3bd-777e-37a3-86c2-2a3859264ce9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System (Managed)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.0(2a)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c3170524-3c20-32ed-a64e-a863bb752743", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
