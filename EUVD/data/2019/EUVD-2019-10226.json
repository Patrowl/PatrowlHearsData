The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages system memory resources when inspecting traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating specific traffic patterns for the software to inspect. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory resources used for traffic inspection. Depending on the configuration, the FTD Software could fail open and cease to inspect traffic or fail closed and result in a DoS condition. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to restore the software.", "datePublished": "2019-01-24T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:17:34", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-firepowertds-bypass", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106721"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1669"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.56, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0cded796-016d-3e1d-b2c7-5071c4867cb7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d77e499-1d0f-3742-a797-c3fff8fc9b21", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
