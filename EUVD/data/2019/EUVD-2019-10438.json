The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors.", "datePublished": "2019-06-05T16:35:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:22:06", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-ind-csrf", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108678"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1881"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.4, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e28a5b6f-a3dd-39c3-b2cc-f009dfd79040", "product": {"name": "Cisco Industrial Network Director"}, "product_version": "1.5(0.250)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ef69a9c9-3cb7-3fc4-bd35-4cb9e43ca781", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
