The vulnerability is due to improper endpoint learning when packets are received on a specific port from outside the ACI fabric and destined to an endpoint located on a border leaf when Disable Remote Endpoint Learning has been enabled. This can result in a Remote (XR) entry being created for the impacted endpoint that will become stale if the endpoint migrates to a different port or leaf switch. This results in traffic not reaching the impacted endpoint until the Remote entry can be relearned by another mechanism.", "datePublished": "2019-08-29T21:50:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:15:02", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nexus-aci-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1977"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.95, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a57fc7af-98b6-329e-a1a2-806d3e711b52", "product": {"name": "Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.2(4M)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4f740164-0818-3039-9cd7-4d4cba3c6173", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
