The vulnerability allows Microsoft browsers to bypass Same-Origin Policy (SOP) restrictions, and to allow requests that should otherwise be ignored. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could force the browser to send data that would otherwise be restricted.\nIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites, and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how affected Microsoft browsers handle different-origin requests.\n", "datePublished": "2019-08-14T20:55:04", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T18:13:29", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1192"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1192"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 2.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3a7fe5c4-e626-3cee-b249-dc1da8c4639d", "product": {"name": "Internet Explorer 10"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "674bdaf8-2d16-30e8-af43-5bac8bf357a6", "product": {"name": "Internet Explorer 11"}, "product_version": "1.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "9b33ad72-7d46-3243-9b34-a81d396ad9e4", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML-based)"}, "product_version": "1.0..0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "189d2c40-a1e9-3798-ac41-ee1054307c7c", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
