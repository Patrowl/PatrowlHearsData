All versions of hostapd and wpa_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The ability to install and execute applications is necessary for a successful attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.7 and newer, are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-17T13:31:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T21:54:44", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9495.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4430", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9495", "https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/", "https://www.synology.com/security/advisory/Synology_SA_19_16", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/56OBBOJJSKRTDGEXZOVFSTP4HDSDBLAE/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDOZGR3T7FVO5JSZWK2QPR7AOFIEJTIZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SVMJOFEYBGXZLFF5IOLW67SSOPKFEJP3/", "https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-19:03.wpa.asc", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/40", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152914/FreeBSD-Security-Advisory-FreeBSD-SA-19-03.wpa.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/07/msg00030.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-02/msg00021.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-9495"], "assigner": "certcc", "epss": 3.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "31441334-7bdd-3624-aa81-a72261696852", "product": {"name": "hostapd with EAP-pwd support"}, "product_version": "2.7 \u22642.7"}, {"id": "350aea84-0aea-32be-acd5-b6db7ea46cd7", "product": {"name": "wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support"}, "product_version": "2.7 \u22642.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eadca421-0fbe-31a2-8d40-f6348398b1f1", "vendor": {"name": "Wi-Fi Alliance"}}], "isExploited": false}
