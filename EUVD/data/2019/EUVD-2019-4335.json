(This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.", "datePublished": "2019-06-11T16:11:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-12-06T13:09:22", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-12749.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4462", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:4032", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3707", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2870", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2868", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1726", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-12749", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-12749.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-12749", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2019-12749.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-12749.html", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/11/2", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/11/2", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4015-1/", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4015-2/", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/16", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108751", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/06/msg00005.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/V2CQF37O73VH2JDVX2ILX2KD2KLXLQOU/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00059.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00092.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00026.html", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201909-08"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12749"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "550063cb-707f-3882-93a7-953791f479f2", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c0c1f4f4-8660-3ca2-a827-efbd490239b2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
