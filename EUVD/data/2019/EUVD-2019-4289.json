The vulnerability is due to excessive processing load for a specific WebVPN HTTP page request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple WebVPN HTTP page load requests for a specific URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU load on the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, which could cause traffic to be delayed through the device.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:53:53", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12698"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2853673f-05e7-3245-8a36-510de050b7fc", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "af4d5afe-1024-3981-abdf-c096d6bd2030", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
