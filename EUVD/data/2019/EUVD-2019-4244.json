The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of Raw Socket Transport payloads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a TCP session and then sending a malicious TCP segment via IPv4 to an affected device. This cannot be exploited via IPv6, as the Raw Socket Transport feature does not support IPv6 as a network layer protocol.", "datePublished": "2019-09-25T20:15:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:56:20", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-rawtcp-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12653"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8d4fabff-c597-3f23-92f2-15040440f19c", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c189ca37-427d-334a-8ab6-ce9b33397a2e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
