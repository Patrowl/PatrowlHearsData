The attacker would need valid device credentials. The vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input at the CLI authentication prompt for development shell access. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering crafted input at the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the AP development shell without proper authentication, which allows for root access to the underlying Linux OS. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.135.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-17T21:45:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:24:38", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-aironet-shell", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107991"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1654"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4afce638-1fde-331b-9c47-cf363c35b749", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3.150.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7203fd71-1dcc-338d-907b-c290819758ad", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
