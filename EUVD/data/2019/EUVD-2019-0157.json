{"id": "EUVD-2019-0157", "enisaUuid": "c037974f-b1fd-3eed-8728-ce043a490ba4", "description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 would parse the Transfer-Encoding header and only look for a single string value, if that value was not chunked it would fall through and use the Content-Length header instead. According to the HTTP standard Transfer-Encoding should be a comma separated list, with the inner-most encoding first, followed by any further transfer codings, ending with chunked. Requests sent with: \\\"Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked\\\" would incorrectly get ignored, and the request would use a Content-Length header instead to determine the body size of the HTTP message. This could allow for Waitress to treat a single request as multiple requests in the case of HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "datePublished": "2019-12-20T23:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-02-25T17:15:00", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-g2xc-35jw-c63p", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/f11093a6b3240fc26830b6111e826128af7771c3", "https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/#security-fixes", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GVDHR2DNKCNQ7YQXISJ45NT4IQDX3LJ7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYEOTGWJZVKPRXX2HBNVIYWCX73QYPM5/", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0720", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16786", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/waitress/PYSEC-2019-137.yaml", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00011.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-16786.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0420", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-16786.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GVDHR2DNKCNQ7YQXISJ45NT4IQDX3LJ7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYEOTGWJZVKPRXX2HBNVIYWCX73QYPM5/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16786", "GHSA-g2xc-35jw-c63p", "PYSEC-2019-137"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3d8fe5a2-79e5-389b-8148-215c6514ff5a", "product": {"name": "Waitress"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.3.1 \u22641.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a713357a-314e-33c9-8591-9e9384ae7782", "vendor": {"name": "Pylons"}}], "isExploited": false}
