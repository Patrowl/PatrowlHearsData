The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:12:12", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12695"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "244021ba-262a-3c16-b4cb-b15077d72fb6", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "207f028c-7a25-30a2-b050-3e20a0861912", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
