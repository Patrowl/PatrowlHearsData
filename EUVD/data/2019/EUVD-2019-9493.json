It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying certain block descriptions created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an administrator execute scripting when configuring a layout, aka XSS. This issue is mitigated by the fact that the attacker would be required to have the permission to create custom blocks, which is typically an administrative task.", "datePublished": "2019-12-19T05:02:57", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:32:09", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-013"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-19901"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.41, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ec0c38f2-2c55-3480-ab1d-d3786f9dd6a4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e30b08f2-873b-3379-ba34-904ebead7b81", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
