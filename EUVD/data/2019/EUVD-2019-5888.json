The Ticket creation form allows users to upload files along with queries. It was found that the file-upload functionality has fewer (or no) mitigations implemented for file content checks; also, the output is not handled properly, causing persistent XSS that leads to cookie stealing or malicious actions. For example, a non-agent user can upload a .html file, and Content-Disposition will be set to inline instead of attachment.", "datePublished": "2019-08-07T16:38:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:38", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-14748", "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/33ed106b1602f559a660a69f931a9d873685d1ba", "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.12.1", "https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.10.7", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154003/osTicket-1.12-File-Upload-Cross-Site-Scripting.html", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47224"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14748"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.53, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "89d48433-6e25-34e0-9464-e1200029764b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "cd57b23f-5dd6-3696-8961-341929245bf5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
