The vulnerability is due to improper resource management in the context of user session management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected system and performing many simultaneous successful Secure Shell (SSH) logins. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system resources and cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid user credentials on the system.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:12:01", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-ftd-fpmc-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12700"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1333ea8f-37ed-3795-a45b-1f6cc2ae5a4a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ea57b02b-9ef6-3631-820a-049aec962edc", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
