The vulnerability exists because OpenSSH mishandles the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the device via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the configuration as an administrative user if the default credentials are not changed. There are no workarounds available; however, if client-side certificate authentication is enabled, disable it and use strong password authentication. Client-side certificate authentication is disabled by default.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:40:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:23:10", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-scbv"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1859"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7116a41b-ae89-317b-bb2b-6472d0342250", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.5.0.78"}, {"id": "fdbd41bc-6c76-34bf-b726-b8297f69457f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.4.10.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "08ca8fc9-15fe-3211-9f4d-0a1d9833f4a0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
