The vulnerability is due to improper resource management for UDP ingress packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP packets to an affected system within a short period of time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available system resources, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2019-01-23T23:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:17:45", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-iot-fnd-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106709"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1644"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fbf26bcc-e1f4-33c6-bf6f-f471eb3bac97", "product": {"name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7823caca-2ada-3b5c-b9dd-9f7ca5279c75", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
