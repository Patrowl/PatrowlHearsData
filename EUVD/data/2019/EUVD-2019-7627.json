When a user requests elevation using the AdminByRequest.exe interface, the interface communicates with the underlying service (Audckq32.exe) using a .NET named pipe. If the underlying service responds that a user is permitted access to the elevation feature, the client then reinitiates communication with the underlying service and requests elevation. This elevation request has no local checks in the service, and depends on client-side validation in the AdminByRequest.exe interface, i.e., it is a vulnerable exposed functionality in the service. By communicating directly with the underlying service, any user can request elevation and obtain Administrator privilege regardless of group policies or permissions.", "datePublished": "2020-01-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:33:17", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AC:L/AV:L/A:N/C:H/I:H/PR:N/S:C/UI:N", "references": ["https://improsec.com/en/responsible-disclosure", "https://www.adminbyrequest.com/en/releasenotes"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-17201"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "52850bf5-058c-34d0-bbcd-0227bd21e407", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a803a932-259b-36ff-9619-6a00f462acf0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
