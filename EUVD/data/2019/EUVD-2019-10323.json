The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not restrict the maximum size of certain files that can be written to disk. An attacker who has valid administrator credentials for an affected system could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, remote connection request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write a file that consumes most of the available disk space on the system, causing application functions to operate abnormally and leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series products running a SIP Software release prior to 12.5(1)SR1.", "datePublished": "2019-03-22T20:05:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:14:46", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190320-ipfudos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1766"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1afc5cac-fee8-354e-bac7-fe9d92152dbd", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phone 8800 Series Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.5(1)SR1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8c059b79-7a64-3c26-8235-158d11a4a013", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
