The vulnerability is due to insufficient security requirements during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious LLDP packet on the adjacent subnet to the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switch in ACI mode. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect an unauthorized server to the infrastructure VLAN, which is highly privileged. With a connection to the infrastructure VLAN, the attacker can make unauthorized connections to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) services or join other host endpoints.", "datePublished": "2019-07-04T20:00:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:20:08", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190703-n9kaci-bypass", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109052"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1890"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "328a841b-ea42-3c42-a48a-4a686a99f885", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS System Software in ACI Mode 11.0.1b"}, "product_version": "unspecified <14.1(2g)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9703b169-0a89-335d-94aa-11348d8cc705", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
