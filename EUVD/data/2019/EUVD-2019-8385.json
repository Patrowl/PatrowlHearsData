In this case, even though the currency does not exist, it will be selected, but a price amount will fall back to the default currency. This means that if an attacker provides a currency that does not exist and is worth less than this default, the attacker can eventually purchase an item for a significantly cheaper price.", "datePublished": "2019-11-02T15:29:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:54:14", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.infigo.hr/en/critical-vulnerability-in-currency-switcher-for-woocommerce-n61", "https://wordpress.org/plugins/currency-switcher-woocommerce/#developers", "https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9936"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-18668"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9b80e33-24ec-3a9f-950d-c1fcdd1626e6", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "350157e2-5a89-3f3c-a7fe-4d836ae87c9c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
