The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:11:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:05:48", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-idn-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15973"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bf7bee6a-2426-3cfb-98e8-c6303bd9a2f1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Industrial Network Director"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a1a29757-839f-310c-afa3-60ead56f05d3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
