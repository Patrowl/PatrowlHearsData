{"id": "EUVD-2019-11470", "enisaUuid": "027fe93c-af6e-31b4-ab33-7129cac604fa", "description": "An issue was discovered in rcp in MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3. Due to the rcp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious rcp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rcp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file). This issue is similar to CVE-2019-6111 and CVE-2019-7283. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions. The affected code was removed from the supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) product many years ago, at version 1.8.", "datePublished": "2021-02-02T17:23:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T03:00:18", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-25017.html", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-25017.html", "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1131109"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-25017"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.61, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7f5e0cb7-bf67-3014-9ef2-e29c38bf63a4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4055d7c0-f8e7-3c28-91db-aee17462e5d0", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
