The vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized` setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, certificate verification will be disabled. This is problematic as engine.io-client 1.6.8 and earlier passes in an object for settings that includes the rejectUnauthorized property, whether it has been set or not. If the value has not been explicitly changed, it will be passed in as `null`, resulting in certificate verification being turned off.", "datePublished": "2018-05-31T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:46:42", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10536", "https://github.com/socketio/engine.io-client/commit/2c55b278a491bf45313ecc0825cf800e2f7ff5c1", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4r4m-hjwj-43p8", "https://www.cigital.com/blog/node-js-socket-io", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/99", "https://www.cigital.com/blog/node-js-socket-io/", "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/99"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10536", "GHSA-4r4m-hjwj-43p8"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "17d8ebfe-d923-342c-820e-eed48786acdb", "product": {"name": "engine.io-client node module"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.6.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "57a966d1-49e3-326f-84d9-cec15dd5d149", "vendor": {"name": "HackerOne"}}], "isExploited": false}
