Version 0.12.7 and lower have an issue with the CORS configuration where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. This would allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts through cross site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing the Same Origin Policy. Note that this is only an issue when `allRoutes` is set to `true` and `origin` is set to `*` or left commented out in the sails CORS config file. The problem can be compounded when the cors `credentials` setting is not provided. At that point authenticated cross domain requests are possible.", "datePublished": "2018-05-31T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T01:46:02", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10549", "https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/commit/0057123a0321be6758845abbeb4290bf418ce542", "https://github.com/balderdashy/sails", "https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/releases/tag/v0.12.7", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/148", "http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/security/cors", "http://sailsjs.org/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-cors", "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/148"], "aliases": ["CVE-2016-10549", "GHSA-qmv4-jgp7-mf68"], "assigner": "hackerone", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6ef652df-a23f-3f1b-9890-4576629f49bf", "product": {"name": "sails node module"}, "product_version": "\u22640.12.7"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7eefff39-85d8-39e2-9c60-5d5e4e1c7d4e", "vendor": {"name": "HackerOne"}}], "isExploited": false}
