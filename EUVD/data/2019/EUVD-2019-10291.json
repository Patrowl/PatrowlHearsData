The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to incomplete role-based access control (RBAC) verification. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and issuing a specific CLI diagnostic command with crafted user-input parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform an arbitrary read of a file on the device, and the file may contain sensitive information. The attacker needs valid device credentials to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-11-05T19:15:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:06:05", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-fxos-info"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1734"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bee565dd-90b8-3b4b-8d12-17cc840dc105", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.2(7)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f5e6bcd7-1fa2-3846-91c1-e2cc06a6dbf0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
