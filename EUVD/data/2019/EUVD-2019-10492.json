{"id": "EUVD-2019-10492", "enisaUuid": "cc013824-4927-35c7-bf55-eb078a7bf26a", "description": "A vulnerability in Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the CLI of an affected system by using the SCP User account (scpuser), which has default user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a documented default account with an undocumented default password and incorrect permission settings for that account. Changing the default password for this account is not enforced during the installation of the product. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the scpuser account. This includes full read and write access to the system's database.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:25:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:00:31", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1935", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imcs-usercred", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/49", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154239/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-Authentication-Bypass-Command-Injection.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/36", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154305/Cisco-UCS-Director-Default-scpuser-Password.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1935"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 89.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b5f5c9aa-f57f-3771-82c1-5611725d2fac", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.7.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b18f232-74a0-3fff-8653-0ef5fc3be769", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
