One is able to bypass Ivanti's FileGuard folder protection by renaming the WMTemp work folder used by PowerGrid. A malicious PowerGrid XML file can then be created, after which the folder is renamed back to its original value. Also, CVE-2018-15591 exploitation can consequently be achieved by using PowerGrid with the /SEE parameter to execute the arbitrary command specified in the XML file.", "datePublished": "2020-03-19T16:57:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:17:39", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://twitter.com/jmoosdijk", "https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Alert-Ivanti-Workspace-Control-September-2019"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16382"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 13.54, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a73e7459-cfa1-32eb-9fec-4d9e7fd98ce5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a91ba50-16bb-34ba-9e79-67c77973afb9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
