It is possible (due to lack of verification and correlation between the reset password key sent by mail and the user_id parameter) to reset the password of another user. One only needs to know the user_id, which is publicly available. One just has to intercept the password modification request and modify user_id. It is possible to modify the passwords for any users or admin WordPress Ultimate Members. This could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation.", "datePublished": "2019-06-21T17:44:51", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:17:19", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://cxsecurity.com/issue/WLB-2019060101"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-10270"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8fde65ce-3987-3698-ae40-7ed56a1bbedd", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0a120fe6-41d1-34a9-93d4-3a1aaadf09f3", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
