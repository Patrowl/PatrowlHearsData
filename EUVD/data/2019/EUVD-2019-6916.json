The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) request for specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) by the IS&ndash;IS process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition in the IS&ndash;IS process.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:31:08", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:46:10", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16027"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "af34ec12-6c74-3c9a-8876-44fae6aaa59d", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9c872213-447c-3671-94ee-4f82244371c1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
