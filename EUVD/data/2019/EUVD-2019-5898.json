The pre-installed Radio application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. A local attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the Radio application. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Radio application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.", "datePublished": "2020-09-14T19:17:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:38", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14759"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "556c82df-9220-39ab-b427-5176189c01df", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "62fe4f56-df68-36e2-bafd-064772bc8a19", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
