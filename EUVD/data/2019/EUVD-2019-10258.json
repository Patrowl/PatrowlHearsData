The vulnerabilities exist because the software insufficiently validates user-supplied input on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information. An attacker would need administrator privileges on the device to exploit these vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:00:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:35:04", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108152"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1701"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0c12127c-d29e-3815-8981-f65bee6802e3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.8.4"}, {"id": "2f531cc4-970a-3818-a197-1a87454b9f06", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.10.1.17"}, {"id": "a3694ed1-b071-397d-9403-a1736cbc5350", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.3.0.3"}, {"id": "adcf17aa-22df-3cec-afe6-8f238d623130", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.9.2.50"}, {"id": "d06702ed-c78b-31e1-93ab-0bd3e1fc1208", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.2.3.12"}, {"id": "d4b00f78-84aa-3fda-9005-f7df11231e96", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.6.4.25"}, {"id": "e242b647-d66e-3d5b-97c8-3447a951ad77", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.4.4.34"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "838793a2-813c-3ac6-b7f0-e872d052d892", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
