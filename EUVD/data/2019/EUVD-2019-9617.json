An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.\nThe attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current user. The attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly sanitizes web requests.", "datePublished": "2019-06-12T13:49:40", "dateUpdated": "2025-05-20T17:50:12", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1032", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1032", "https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2019-1032"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1032"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 0.44, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "886aceda-1494-3031-b71d-d42c4af6ad02", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016"}, "product_version": "16.0.0 <publication"}, {"id": "a9b812c7-1dcb-3b2e-b404-3f1feafed7db", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server"}, "product_version": "2016"}, {"id": "b8d30978-161d-34f6-a7ce-e71d64764eb8", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Server"}, "product_version": "2019"}, {"id": "bd55aa1a-5a68-317e-8711-ca57410e2661", "product": {"name": "Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019"}, "product_version": "16.0.0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "382cc19f-ff2e-3b48-a183-074fd2e7c690", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
