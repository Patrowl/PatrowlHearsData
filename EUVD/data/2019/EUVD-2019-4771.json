In order to transfer data from the host network to the guest network, the sender joins and then leaves an IGMP group. After it leaves, the router (following the IGMP protocol) creates an IGMP Membership Query packet with the Group IP and sends it to both the Host and the Guest networks. The data is transferred within the Group IP field, which is completely controlled by the sender.", "datePublished": "2019-08-27T17:07:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:49:23", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il/publications/CrossRouter", "https://www.usenix.org/system/files/woot19-paper_ovadia.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13264"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "68ee68d0-aa0a-3cac-b824-b520cf803f4e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "de905120-6be3-315f-9621-f06addb179fb", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
