The vulnerability occurs because BPDUs received from specific wireless clients are forwarded incorrectly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability on the wireless network by sending a steady stream of crafted BPDU frames. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a limited denial of service (DoS) attack because an AP port could go offline.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:07:55", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-airo-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15265"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7be0912a-d3ec-3bd3-8003-43676795f5b5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "39946b0d-a9f3-3439-859b-94f77c0f6a4e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
