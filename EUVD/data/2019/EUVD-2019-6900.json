The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based GUI of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:45:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:44:17", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-iphone-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16008"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "91e60d17-900e-3836-8bce-98a487dedd6f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bd453106-bf4a-37fc-912f-cab79f525eca", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
