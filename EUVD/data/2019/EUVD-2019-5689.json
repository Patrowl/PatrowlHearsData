A guest Android operating system inside the MEmu emulator contains a /system/bin/systemd binary that is run with root privileges on startup (this is unrelated to Red Hat's systemd init program, and is a closed-source proprietary tool that seems to be developed by Microvirt). This program opens TCP port 21509, presumably to receive installation-related commands from the host OS. Because everything after the installer:uninstall command is concatenated directly into a system() call, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands by supplying shell metacharacters.", "datePublished": "2020-02-10T21:52:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:19:41", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/seqred-s-a/cve-2019-14514"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14514"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 10.37, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d674a88a-cf1e-387c-9260-540372fafabe", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a49f7a86-49b5-321a-be7b-286a03445908", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
