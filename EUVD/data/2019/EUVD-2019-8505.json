TCP data packet 9 on port 4244 from the victim's device contains cleartext information such as the device model and OS version, IMSI, and 20 bytes of udid in a binary format, which is located at offset 0x14 of this packet. Then, the attacker installs Viber on his device, initiates the registration process for any phone number, but doesn't enter a pin from SMS. Instead, he closes Viber. Next, the attacker rewrites his udid with the victim's udid, modifying the viber_udid file, which is located in the Viber preferences folder. (The udid is stored in a hexadecimal format.) Finally, the attacker starts Viber again and enters the pin from SMS.", "datePublished": "2019-11-06T15:34:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:02:39", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://thesamarkand.tumblr.com/post/188785277609/viber-messenger-remote-account-reset-0day"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-18800"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "701fae95-3977-3f43-925c-c6f50d44480d", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "70848a07-5531-3ae4-8fa2-01c18e91a713", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
