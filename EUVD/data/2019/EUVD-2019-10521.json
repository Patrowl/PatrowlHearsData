The vulnerability is due to improper validation of IPv6 traffic sent through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition while the netstack process restarts. A sustained attack could lead to a reboot of the device.", "datePublished": "2019-08-28T18:55:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:58:18", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-ipv6-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1964"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1aaeb1fc-5d0d-3706-bc91-cfa7b103505f", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software 8.1(1)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.4(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fa46a706-3c10-3fd3-b4d8-d55443c34bc1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
