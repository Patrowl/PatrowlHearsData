When processed, the commands will be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as the root user.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:27:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:02:49", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-sbr-cominj"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15957"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1044eff3-2810-36a4-8d1f-995ee413283d", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Router Firmware"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "834141ac-2225-3a58-8128-c4eb4f6a5d75", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
