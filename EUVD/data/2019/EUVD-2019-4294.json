The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the affected software through crafted DHCP requests, and then persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:28", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:09:08", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-spa-dhcp-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12703"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b07031cd-e8ad-3070-abc9-9053493e3c0c", "product": {"name": "Cisco SPA122 ATA with Router"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7fc324c5-93fa-3e8c-9048-cb7a24489d15", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
