The vulnerability is due to a default local account with a static password. The account has privileges only to reboot the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by guessing the account name and password to access the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reboot the device repeatedly, creating a denial of service (DoS) condition. It is not possible to change the configuration or view sensitive data with this account. Versions prior to DNAC1.2.8 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-02-07T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:17:27", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-aas-creds", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106944"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1675"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.97, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1113296e-8d10-3e9e-bcf3-add70ff07458", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Active Sensor"}, "product_version": "unspecified <DNAC1.2.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "13e686b0-0951-3ee0-bcd7-2fa575ae703f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
