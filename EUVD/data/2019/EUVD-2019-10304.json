The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SMS protocol data units (PDUs) that are encoded with a special character set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SMS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless WAN (WWAN) cellular interface module on an affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "datePublished": "2019-03-27T23:50:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:13:22", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-sms-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107599"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1747"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "dbab189c-8298-35be-8249-7b3a5dd358cb", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software"}, "product_version": "16.10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a7a944d9-8394-33b0-9b8c-38a26fa27de7", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
