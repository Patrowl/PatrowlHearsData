The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. This vulnerability has been fixed in software version 14.1(1i).", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:35:32", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:32:17", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-apic-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108169"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1838"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7f019ec3-306d-330f-a351-5b0d449260ae", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.1(1i)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d8ef6be6-010e-3648-9f30-3a9c48d2cd14", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
