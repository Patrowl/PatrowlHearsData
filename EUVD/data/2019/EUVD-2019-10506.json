The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T07:25:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:17:56", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-fmc-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1949"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "14d1a820-312f-31fb-aae3-4f467901b288", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.4.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bbe77c87-7c7c-3d83-89c9-bf76ddf01739", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
