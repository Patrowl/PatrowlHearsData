This provides everything that is needed for an attacker to hijack active connections inside the VPN tunnel.", "datePublished": "2019-12-11T14:45:12", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:39", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-14899.html", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-14899", "https://openvpn.net/security-advisory/no-flaws-found-in-openvpn-software/", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211288", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211290", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211289", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Jul/25", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Jul/24", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Jul/23", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/08/13/2", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211850", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/10/07/3", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211931", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Nov/20", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Dec/32", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/07/05/1"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14899"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d5da9aa9-82e7-3a93-b0f0-00aadc812603", "product": {"name": "VPN"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ef5fba16-b11c-32e8-a5a4-bab9af8bd0df", "vendor": {"name": "Red Hat"}}], "isExploited": false}
