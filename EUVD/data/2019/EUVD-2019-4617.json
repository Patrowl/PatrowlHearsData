When the server administrator delegates rootDN (database admin) privileges for certain databases but wants to maintain isolation (e.g., for multi-tenant deployments), slapd does not properly stop a rootDN from requesting authorization as an identity from another database during a SASL bind or with a proxyAuthz (RFC 4370) control. (It is not a common configuration to deploy a system where the server administrator and a DB administrator enjoy different levels of trust.)", "datePublished": "2019-07-26T12:19:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:41:10", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-13057.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-13057", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-13057.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-1/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00024.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-2/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00053.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00058.html", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/23", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Dec/26", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210788", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10365", "https://www.openldap.org/its/?findid=9038", "https://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-announce/201907/msg00001.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190822-0004/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13057"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.58, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1ccf77a1-9568-3040-a277-b99b82995834", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "42c457f0-66c8-369c-a730-d9c5758a3546", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
