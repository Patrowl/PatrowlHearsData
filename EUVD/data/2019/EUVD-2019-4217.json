The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:05:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:15:55", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-ccx-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12626"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "034f8fcf-ea4e-3715-88af-aad2862b0204", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Contact Center Express"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.0(1)ES02"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d600962f-56b9-33be-b4ab-bce00d78287f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
