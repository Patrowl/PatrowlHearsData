The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link and subsequently access a specific web interface page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:30", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:08:32", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-sbss-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12718"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1defe695-985d-3d7c-b287-8eb1a39c57c5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "477a4911-523d-34cd-bd38-cc933b2966b3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
