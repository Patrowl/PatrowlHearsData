The vulnerability is due to an incorrect allocation of an internal interface index. An adjacent attacker with the ability to submit a crafted FCoE packet that crosses affected interfaces could trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet loop and high throughput on the affected interfaces, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 7.3(5)N1(1).", "datePublished": "2019-03-06T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:44:00", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107320", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nexus-fbr-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1595"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2f4a7ada-4519-3d3c-888c-2e0b2206280b", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "7.3(5)N1(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5736066-e67b-3370-9e95-d88f7979e832", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
