The vulnerability is due to improper resource management during CAPWAP message processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high volume of legitimate wireless management frames within a short time to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition for clients associated with the AP.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:08:07", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-airo-capwap-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15264"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e090f9a0-67c1-315b-b45d-0fd5c9989d04", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c716c085-b1c9-329d-96d0-bc7aefa43448", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
