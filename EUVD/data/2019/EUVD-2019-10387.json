The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation of the HTTP URL used to establish a connection to the LSC Certificate Authority (CA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and configuring a LSC certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to an unexpected restart of the device.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T01:15:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:37:26", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-cert-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108028"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1830"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "72c2c80a-5f14-3b9f-8bce-b58223c798b7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "8.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0f30e473-b878-3aa7-945e-89e85bca62d8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
