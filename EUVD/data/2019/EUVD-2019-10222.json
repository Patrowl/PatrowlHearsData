The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Versions prior to 3.5(1a) are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-02-21T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:45:22", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107097", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190220-hyper-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1665"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "aaed3fff-d41d-3395-9c32-3ee402dc6acc", "product": {"name": "Cisco HyperFlex HX-Series"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.5(1a)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c2095d59-41f0-32a0-84ba-8213d623e23a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
