The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the lspv_server process to crash. The crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic though the device, resulting in a DoS condition that require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "datePublished": "2019-05-16T01:20:47", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:23:38", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-asr9k-mpls-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108363"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1846"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e3e560d-8c3b-302f-866e-f41d7b1166b3", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0fa54583-a8de-36e2-8823-c5e1770521c1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
