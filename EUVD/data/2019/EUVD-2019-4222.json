The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T18:20:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:13:02", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-ise-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12631"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a75d7a0-8b9b-34d2-9ab2-00b320b1711a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da3f4e32-7b8b-3658-90c4-0d8fad97706a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
