The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a specific CLI command on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with elevated privileges. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T20:15:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:20:05", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-cmdinj-1795", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108479"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1795"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d62c383-91a1-3f60-91bc-42e065407c8a", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5e6cfa97-4df8-3655-9ebc-7594b490fa8b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
