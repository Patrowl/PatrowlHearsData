The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of log file content stored on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a log file with malicious code and getting a user to view the modified log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T07:40:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:16:25", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-nfv-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1973"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4d32634e-331c-3355-855e-07bf149e1324", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d5ef7e9d-f769-3943-8058-232ad7c3b65d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
