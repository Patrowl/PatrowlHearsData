Prior to version 1.14.1, clicking on smartbanner `View` link and navigating to 3rd party page leaves `window.opener` exposed. It may allow hostile third parties to abuse `window.opener`, e.g. by redirection or injection on the original page with smartbanner. `rel=\"noopener\"` is automatically populated to links as of `v1.14.1` which is a recommended upgrade to resolve the vulnerability. Some workarounds are available for those who cannot upgrade. Ensure `View` link is only taking users to App Store or Google Play Store where security is guarded by respective app store security teams. If `View` link is going to a third party page, limit smartbanner.js to be used on iOS that decreases the scope of the vulnerability since as of Safari 12.1,  `rel=\"noopener\"` is imposed on all `target=\"_blank\"` links. Version 1.14.1 of smartbanner.js contains a fix for the issue.", "datePublished": "2025-02-18T17:38:52", "dateUpdated": "2025-02-18T18:53:49", "baseScore": 1.3, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N/E:U", "references": ["https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/security/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2", "https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js", "https://github.com/ain/smartbanner.js/commit/fce8c31dfe04033d9d005a89694d3e7a60784f89"], "aliases": ["GHSA-9mrq-cjgh-32g2", "CVE-2025-25300"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.25, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8dc0a2bc-db53-3af6-b713-1c8b10b4b96f", "product": {"name": "smartbanner.js"}, "product_version": "< 1.14.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9cf1219a-2093-353f-a17f-e0b73d0deb27", "vendor": {"name": "ain"}}], "isExploited": false}
