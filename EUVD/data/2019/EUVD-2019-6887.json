The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:41:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:04:42", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-stealth-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15994"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "90fe5f27-9fa2-3ad0-bd50-023f4ef33506", "product": {"name": "Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9782686e-ad3a-3ce1-8173-b5b32ff77ab8", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
