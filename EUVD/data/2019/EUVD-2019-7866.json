NOTE: the effects of this documentation cross application domains, and thus it is likely that security-relevant code elsewhere is affected. This issue is not a Python implementation bug, and there are no reports that NMR researchers were specifically relying on library/glob.html. In other words, because the older documentation stated \"finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell,\" one might have incorrectly inferred that the sorting that occurs in a Unix shell also occurred for glob.glob. There is a workaround in newer versions of Willoughby nmr-data_compilation-p2.py and nmr-data_compilation-p3.py, which call sort() directly.", "datePublished": "2019-10-12T12:07:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:40:15", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-17514.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-17514", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-17514.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150906020027/https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/glob.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160526201356/https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/glob.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150822013622/https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160309211341/https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html", "https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/ac50fbac377e32b98d2de396f016ea81e8ee9961/pathexp.c#L380", "https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/ac50fbac377e32b98d2de396f016ea81e8ee9961/pathexp.c#L405", "https://bugs.python.org/issue33275", "https://twitter.com/LucasCMoore/status/1181615421922824192", "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216/suppl_file/ol9b03216_si_002.zip", "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b03216", "https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjwda/a-code-glitch-may-have-caused-errors-in-more-than-100-published-studies", "https://twitter.com/chris_bloke/status/1181997278136958976", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20191107-0005/", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4428-1/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-17514"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 1.71, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9e21c77-a32c-34fb-bf88-218d3d22cf3c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "09dd50e1-47f6-3eb4-9b13-592de9227c21", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
