The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly parses certain options in OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA) type 11 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LSA type 11 OSPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition for client traffic that is traversing the device.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:39", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:12:54", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ospf-lsa-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12676"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.11, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5854ac59-80ce-3bd7-9a2a-c1573434528e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d2c5995-8533-32c7-911f-3ed28ad6dadb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
