The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message with a crafted XML payload to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention may be required to recover the device. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Releases X12.5.1 and later.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T00:20:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:39:48", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-es-tvcs-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108016"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1721"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3eda439f-a24b-355c-a9fe-8487498a089e", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <X12.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "52a1bccd-8c78-3b52-8a82-90d68a5de7df", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
