Exploitation of this vulnerability requires privileged access to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface with administrator privileges and then sending a malicious request to a certain part of the interface.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:25:18", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:11:20", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1936", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-imcs-ucs-cmdinj", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/49", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154239/Cisco-UCS-IMC-Supervisor-Authentication-Bypass-Command-Injection.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/36", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154308/Cisco-UCS-Director-Unauthenticated-Remote-Code-Execution.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1936"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 62.36, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fda813d-5386-3046-b30c-0a6cfd200e57", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System Director"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.7.3.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0bdce322-967b-333f-97a0-cbeed5785bf5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
