The vulnerability is due to incorrect role-based access control (RBAC) evaluation when a low-privileged user requests access to a Guest OS that should be restricted to administrative accounts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the Guest OS by using the low-privileged-user credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Guest OS as a root user.", "datePublished": "2019-09-25T20:05:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:10:26", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-ios-gos-auth"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12648"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "65ecda6d-77f2-3d82-8362-c0d9bba2afa7", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS 15.7(3)M"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3bc11502-b71b-38e6-9d6d-52f7e04052dd", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
