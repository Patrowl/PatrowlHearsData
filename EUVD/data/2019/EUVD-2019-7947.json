The user must chose to reopen an already parsed heap dump with an untrusted index for the problem to occur. The problem can be averted if the index files from an untrusted source are deleted and the heap dump is opened and reparsed. Also some local configuration data is subject to a deserialization vulnerability if the local data were to be replaced with a malicious version. This can be averted if the local configuration data stored on the file system cannot be changed by an attacker. The vulnerability could possibly allow code execution on the local system.", "datePublished": "2020-01-17T18:35:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:47:13", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=558633"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-17635"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.47, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "36a884ec-be83-3ca6-ad07-1216166d3e19", "product": {"name": "Eclipse Memory Analyzer"}, "product_version": "All versions prior to version 1.9.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ab18bf7d-f896-3f57-98d0-8551c1892c7a", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
