When Squid is run as root, it spawns its child processes as a lesser user, by default the user nobody. This is done via the leave_suid call. leave_suid leaves the Saved UID as 0. This makes it trivial for an attacker who has compromised the child process to escalate their privileges back to root.", "datePublished": "2020-04-15T19:00:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:24:38", "baseScore": 4.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-12522.html", "https://gitlab.com/jeriko.one/security/-/blob/master/squid/CVEs/CVE-2019-12522.txt", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210205-0006/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12522"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b28949d3-b52f-3cc0-84a8-b0322e5e81f7", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8354e06f-a2b9-3e3a-b52e-0810b34b6f08", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
