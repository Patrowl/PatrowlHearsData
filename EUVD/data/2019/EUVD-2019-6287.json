The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in certain sections of the interface that are visible to other users. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:06:59", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-fpwr-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15280"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fd7d9a51-a560-3202-b63c-759dbd3641f9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "adfba338-3087-3ae0-860b-49d02b692bd1", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
