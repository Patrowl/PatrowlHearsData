The attacker would need valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input for certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and submitting crafted input for a CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to the underlying Linux OS without proper authentication.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T01:15:23", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:24:29", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-air-ap-cmdinj", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107990"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1829"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4f6fd19d-eea1-3855-b08c-90c11112d737", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "8.5(131.0)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ab7a77e6-4944-31e2-83ff-04d61c367077", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
