The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-07-06T01:30:24", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:19:28", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190703-fmc-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1931"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0b9945ca-05f8-3eb8-8e2c-34e5d7d34a36", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.2.3.14"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4d30ffb8-6198-3157-ab8a-fd5780665165", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
