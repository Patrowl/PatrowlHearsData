The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. A successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T07:30:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:01:35", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-fnd-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1957"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.52, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "81b24881-d30f-3862-b4c3-6836d761e2c2", "product": {"name": "Cisco IoT Field Network Director (IoT-FND)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9912dbe1-b8fd-31c3-97ec-cf8a22efe88b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
