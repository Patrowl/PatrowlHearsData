The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges. An attacker would need valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability. Nexus 3000, 3500, and Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(4).", "datePublished": "2019-03-08T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:43:51", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-cmdinj-1606", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107345"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1606"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "017a20ea-92b3-3922-b10c-b48e221d5756", "product": {"name": "Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode"}, "product_version": "unspecified <7.0(3)I7(4)"}, {"id": "9811728e-7092-34da-b8b2-a80449b84568", "product": {"name": "Nexus 3000 Series Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <7.0(3)I7(4)"}, {"id": "ae852f35-59ce-399b-9139-9b140194c510", "product": {"name": "Nexus 3500 Platform Switches"}, "product_version": "unspecified <7.0(3)I7(4)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a415276-f380-3160-a3fb-fb725e7d9efe", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
