The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:08:49", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-vcs-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12705"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9ca9e1e-a37b-3246-9086-dcc4523e2d4f", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ceba4b95-3bbb-30c7-bf99-161c3fbe4a76", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
