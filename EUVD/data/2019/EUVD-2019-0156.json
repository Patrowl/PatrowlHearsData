This can lead to a potential for HTTP request smuggling/splitting whereby Waitress may see two requests while the front-end server only sees a single HTTP message. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "datePublished": "2019-12-20T23:15:00", "dateUpdated": "2020-02-25T17:15:00", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-pg36-wpm5-g57p", "https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/commit/8eba394ad75deaf9e5cd15b78a3d16b12e6b0eba", "https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/#security-fixes", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GVDHR2DNKCNQ7YQXISJ45NT4IQDX3LJ7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYEOTGWJZVKPRXX2HBNVIYWCX73QYPM5/", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0720", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16785", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/waitress/PYSEC-2019-136.yaml", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00011.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-16785.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0420", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-16785.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GVDHR2DNKCNQ7YQXISJ45NT4IQDX3LJ7/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYEOTGWJZVKPRXX2HBNVIYWCX73QYPM5/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16785", "GHSA-pg36-wpm5-g57p", "PYSEC-2019-136"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "386ea5b4-cbbf-3707-9da3-f6b2822eb95f", "product": {"name": "Waitress"}, "product_version": "\u2264 1.3.1 \u22641.3.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "583b5a90-13bd-353a-a096-6f532e38e7ce", "vendor": {"name": "Pylons"}}], "isExploited": false}
