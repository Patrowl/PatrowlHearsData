Due to a failure to validate security headers, it was possible for a specially crafted request to the staging service to bypass the initial authentication and proceed to deserialize user-controlled .NET object input. This deserialization then led to unauthenticated remote code execution on the server where the Kentico instance was hosted.", "datePublished": "2019-03-26T17:43:23", "dateUpdated": "2025-10-21T23:45:41", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-10068", "https://devnet.kentico.com/download/hotfixes#securityBugs-v12", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157588/Kentico-CMS-12.0.14-Remote-Command-Execution.html", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10068", "https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog?field_cve=CVE-2019-10068"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-10068"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 93.9, "exploitedSince": "2022-03-25T00:00:00", "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ace92a97-7bbf-3fac-b68b-75d949ab8195", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ad5736f6-945b-36c0-83d8-1ceb74bb6179", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": true}
