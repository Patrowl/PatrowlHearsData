The vulnerability is due to improper validation of the server firmware upgrade images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a server firmware version that would allow the attacker to disable UEFI Secure Boot. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the signature validation checks that are done by UEFI Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.", "datePublished": "2020-09-23T00:26:09", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-13T18:05:16", "baseScore": 6.2, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-ucs-boot-bypass"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1736"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.03, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bab024a5-8705-3d13-b869-0efd6c66f2e2", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "888abcb8-cf34-37a6-97ce-d15fa56f27a4", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
