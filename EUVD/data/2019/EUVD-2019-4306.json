The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:53", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:10:51", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-cucm-xss-12715"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12715"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "686d9b36-a7e9-3110-948a-4f81232351c4", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "29ee16c9-90f5-3b1b-a80c-adc3ffa863e5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
