The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:07:17", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-firepwr-stored-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15270"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "58e46f18-3426-3e56-a65d-4473f8b1bb3b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "df64e2a0-84ba-3670-8483-a682d26cbeee", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
