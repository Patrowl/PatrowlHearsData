The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of the affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-09-05T01:20:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:14:54", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190904-ise-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12644"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.31, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0e0b70df-cf22-37b5-9b44-eea2b323029a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "624e1fc3-4683-3bb0-b2ae-c08d249eb920", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
