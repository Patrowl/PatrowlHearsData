The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling when XML data within a SIP packet is parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SIP packet that contains a malicious XML payload to an affected phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected phone to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T14:55:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:09:54", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-phone-sip-xml-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1635"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "24150eb6-0e43-36b4-9f61-a4e43bcfbd71", "product": {"name": "Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series and 8800 Series"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.5(1)"}, {"id": "d1d24f21-3395-30f8-b69c-46356a7f9489", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless IP Phone 8821 and 8821-EX"}, "product_version": "unspecified <11.0(5)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "78f617e7-cc59-34db-a36b-7d07fa3611e3", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
