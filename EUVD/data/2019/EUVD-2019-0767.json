This guess could be highly informed by a basic understanding of the symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles source code. (Users who upgrade from SilverStripe 3.x to 4.x and had Versioned Files installed have no further need for this module, because the 4.x release has built-in versioning. However, nothing in the upgrade process automates the destruction of these insecure artefacts, nor alerts the user to the criticality of destruction.)", "datePublished": "2019-09-26T14:36:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:17:39", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16409", "https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/blob/master/silverstripe/framework/CVE-2019-16409.yaml", "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework", "https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-versionedfiles", "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2019-16409"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16409", "GHSA-xm6j-x342-gwq9"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4a4da308-b220-3877-9e45-8b71e3c54cff", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "433dbd33-85a5-35d6-842b-b859adcad5f8", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
