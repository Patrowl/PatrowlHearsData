ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works when ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is defined. This leads to a problem in the remove() function in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp. When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is not defined, the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the array, and cause denial of service for other components (that depend on the communication-related functions of this package). NOTE: The reporter of this issue now believes it was a false alarm.", "datePublished": "2019-12-30T17:50:01", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:57:37", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://github.com/ros/ros_comm/issues/1748"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13465"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.43, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "3408938e-cce1-33ad-bcee-e6db1d7a50f0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c90f67b3-741b-375f-b508-050032e1f039", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
