The vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the NX-OS device itself would still be available and passing network traffic. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.", "datePublished": "2019-08-29T21:50:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:57:48", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-api-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1968"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b2957de1-d302-3454-ae72-4d58e98ef620", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software 6.0(2)A4(1)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(2)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8116bd18-d4ca-30ed-ab09-1b4b10c1bb15", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
