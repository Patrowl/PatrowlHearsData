The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-06-05T16:30:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:22:37", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-ece-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108645"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1870"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7b93f816-064e-3351-8992-fe83e1614ada", "product": {"name": "Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email"}, "product_version": "unspecified <11.6(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1d2aa167-02b6-3304-bd65-db2ae3cd017e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
