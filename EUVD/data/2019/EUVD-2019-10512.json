The vulnerability is due to incomplete input and validation checking mechanisms for certain SPF messages that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a customized SPF packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the header filters that are configured for the affected device, which could allow malicious content to pass through the device.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T07:30:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:01:25", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-esm-inject"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1955"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b71ee9c8-8a64-3da6-8019-74905a2c8821", "product": {"name": "Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4e483c3c-2104-3898-a92b-6d765e9558d6", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
