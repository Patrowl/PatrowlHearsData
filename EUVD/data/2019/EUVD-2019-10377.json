This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information.", "datePublished": "2019-05-16T01:10:45", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:25:24", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-pathtrav-1820", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108345"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1820"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 13.89, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bb361c9f-9f14-3e6d-9320-58d3aa32e2eb", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "3.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "41248f85-0f0b-3fdb-897b-eb9e3f29ebae", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
