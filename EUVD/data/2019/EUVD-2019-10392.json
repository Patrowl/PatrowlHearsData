The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in specific CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the CLI of an affected AP with administrator privileges and issuing crafted commands that result in directory traversal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view system files on the affected device, which could contain sensitive information. Software versions 8.8 and 8.9 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T01:20:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:37:00", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-air-ap-traversal", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108001"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1835"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "291a9a95-70fc-311e-88a6-d56f0e944e74", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "8.9"}, {"id": "a121540c-aa24-32a8-9569-ce761970eca7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Aironet Access Point Software"}, "product_version": "8.8"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "94e7ef91-7e53-34d0-9478-f859f12b7671", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
