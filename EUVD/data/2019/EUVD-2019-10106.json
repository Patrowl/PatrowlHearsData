{"id": "EUVD-2019-10106", "enisaUuid": "84182df1-475d-347d-a625-27b0c8f5adc7", "description": "OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).", "datePublished": "2019-09-10T16:58:35", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-16T22:56:57", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-1549.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4539", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1840", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1337", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1336", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-1549", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-1549.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GY6SNRJP2S7Y42GIIDO3HXPNMDYN2U3A/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZN4VVQJ3JDCHGIHV4Y2YTXBYQZ6PWQ7E/", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Oct/1", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-1/", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html", "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190910.txt", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190919-0002/", "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=1b0fe00e2704b5e20334a16d3c9099d1ba2ef1be", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K44070243", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K44070243?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1549"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 2.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "24681cc3-9d9d-3b3c-8eec-f88b36bb1318", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0c0a62c5-7c76-34ad-94d9-efb1da4cbba1", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
