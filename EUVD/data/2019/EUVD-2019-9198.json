In a number of places bitmaps are being used by the hypervisor to track certain state. Iteration over all bits involves functions which may misbehave in certain corner cases: On 32-bit Arm accesses to bitmaps with bit a count which is a multiple of 32, an out of bounds access may occur. A malicious guest may cause a hypervisor crash or hang, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are vulnerable. 32-bit Arm systems are vulnerable. 64-bit Arm systems are not vulnerable.", "datePublished": "2019-12-11T16:50:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:16:48", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-19581.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602", "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-307.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D5R73AYE53QA32KTMHUVKCX6E52CIS43/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/34HBFTYNMQMWIO2GGK7DB6KV4M6R5YPV/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00011.html", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-56"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-19581"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9d6f1947-fd16-309d-9a04-17e214c0d049", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "433adc3c-9eea-3dac-9525-b6c6e4593cf9", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
