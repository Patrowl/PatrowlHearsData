An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user\u2019s system.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker's site.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge based on Edge HTML handles objects in memory.\n", "datePublished": "2019-08-14T20:55:02", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T18:06:31", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C", "references": ["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1030"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1030"], "assigner": "microsoft", "epss": 17.77, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b629b270-a225-33c1-8cf8-ab2d139e6af6", "product": {"name": "Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML-based)"}, "product_version": "1.0..0 <publication"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6a226458-b2e7-3e32-a564-ee4edbb788ed", "vendor": {"name": "Microsoft"}}], "isExploited": false}
