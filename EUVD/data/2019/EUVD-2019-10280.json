This account does not have administrator privileges. The vulnerability exists because the affected software has a user account with a default, static password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system using this account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the CSPC using the default account. For Cisco CSPC 2.7.x, Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Release 2.7.4.6. For Cisco CSPC 2.8.x, Cisco fixed this vulnerability in Release 2.8.1.2.", "datePublished": "2019-03-13T21:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:15:01", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190313-cspcscv", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107405", "https://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Cisco-Collector.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1723"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 25.34, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5b466b05-0028-3260-b961-372024dbda9c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.7.4.6"}, {"id": "c5dcfb7e-23b9-3fce-bd4f-0ee42cb8e123", "product": {"name": "Cisco Common Services Platform Collector Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.8.1.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1fb987b5-bab4-3187-b307-f50b75eba55b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
