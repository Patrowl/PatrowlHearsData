The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of a CLI command that allows a Bash command to be incorrectly invoked on the Guest Shell CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the Guest Shell prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to issue commands that should be restricted by a Guest Shell account.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T16:50:43", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:30:45", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-bash-bypass", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108397"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1730"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.05, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9a01462f-a7db-3b53-8721-2dd70c99104c", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "18f661c9-9eaf-3f54-9a29-79e8a620808a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
