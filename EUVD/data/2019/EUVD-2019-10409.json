The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:35:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:32:32", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-pnr-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1852"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2262ac21-b60d-33ce-a0bc-60a762598f24", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Network Registrar"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.1(2)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9bae72b3-c0e5-31c9-90f8-cd2575ad2183", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
