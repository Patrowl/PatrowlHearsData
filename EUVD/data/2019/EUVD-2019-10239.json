The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T14:55:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:23:53", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-apic-priv-escalation"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1682"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.04, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "de22fd27-303b-3aa9-aace-c1732a5a557f", "product": {"name": "Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <4.1(1i)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e521f911-0a8a-39c8-af6e-926ac41ce727", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
