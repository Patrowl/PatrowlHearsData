The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying various CLI commands with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands as the root user, allowing complete compromise of the system.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:10:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:12:30", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-rphy"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1839"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b6fccef6-59b0-320d-b8e2-be88a1af4187", "product": {"name": "Cisco Remote PHY"}, "product_version": "unspecified <6.4"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ba4fc919-d307-3a21-bbf4-143115bf3209", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
