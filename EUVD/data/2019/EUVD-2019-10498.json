The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ISE running software releases prior to 2.4.0 Patch 9 and 2.6.0.", "datePublished": "2019-07-17T20:25:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:18:49", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190717-ise-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109297"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1941"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.38, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d56e953c-a36d-3a1b-8f1f-51dea02ed778", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <2.6.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "33864164-3643-3ac4-ae7d-87f357d92b6a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
