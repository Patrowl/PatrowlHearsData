{"id": "EUVD-2019-10406", "enisaUuid": "d700a726-842e-3654-9654-9dbdbcadc759", "description": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Patrol (BGP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network. A successful exploit could result in a crash of the l2vpn_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.", "datePublished": "2019-05-16T01:20:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:23:53", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108342"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1849"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "79a1fe43-ae21-3fbe-ad90-e5da386859f4", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "43506798-4f71-3bbd-aa57-a7eb79634b52", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
