{"id": "EUVD-2019-8192", "enisaUuid": "119f4b4f-8185-396b-ac97-937cc607bbab", "description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users to cause a denial of service via a XENMEM_add_to_physmap hypercall. p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by the functions p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guest physical frame. The rest of the code in the two functions will assume that there is a valid root table and check that with BUG_ON(). The function p2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top bits of a guest physical frame. This means that the function p2m_set_entry() will alias the frame. However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using the original frame. It would be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a frame that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in p2m_get_entry() and p2m_resolve_translation_fault(). Additionally, the sanity check on p2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one allowing \"highest mapped + 1\" to be considered valid. However, p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL. The problem could be triggered with a specially crafted hypercall XENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an address (via hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but cause p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL. A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems are not affected.", "datePublished": "2019-10-31T13:36:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:54:14", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18423.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-18423.html", "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-301.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/10/31/4", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2BQKX7M2RHCWDBKNPX4KEBI3MJIH6AYZ/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/I5WWPW4BSZDDW7VHU427XTVXV7ROOFFW/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IZYATWNUGHRBG6I3TC24YHP5Y3J7I6KH/", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-56"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-18423"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.45, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "864ba816-fc19-3086-8ada-b221c7001aa4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "bf53a9a1-879a-3e36-8598-eff2cae7efad", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
