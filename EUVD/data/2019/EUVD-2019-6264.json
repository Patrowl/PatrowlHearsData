The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center Software releases earlier than 1.3.0.6 and 1.3.1.4.", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T17:30:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:43:16", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-15253", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190205-dnac-xss", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157668/Cisco-Digital-Network-Architecture-Center-1.3.1.4-Cross-Site-Scripting.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15253"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2ec3671f-4449-38d9-b94d-7122851467f9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "1.3.1.4"}, {"id": "a0c68022-6499-3762-bf19-ab32087c8ae8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "1.3.0.6"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d9b8872c-fe69-36fe-8d54-a519f7634332", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
