The vulnerability is due to a failure to free system memory when an unexpected DHCP request is received. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T23:45:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:25:40", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-sb300sms-dhcp", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108344"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1814"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.33, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "16339f33-704e-3180-8f15-ad43e1199472", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches"}, "product_version": "1.4.0.88"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b0517708-c06f-37fe-a298-9d743ed2b108", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
