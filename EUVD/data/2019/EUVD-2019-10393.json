These system files may be sensitive and should not be overwritable by non-root users. The attacker would need valid device credentials. The vulnerability is due to incorrect symbolic link verification of directory paths when they are used in the system shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and providing crafted user input to specific symbolic link CLI commands. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to overwrite system files that should be restricted. This vulnerability has been fixed in software version 14.1(1i).", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:30:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:34:07", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-fabric-traversal", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108150"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1836"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d4ebe251-21a1-301f-af2b-a722a9189d17", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software for Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches ACI Mode"}, "product_version": "unspecified <14.1(1i)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2a340377-dd5b-3778-b4bf-c9c579e85223", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
