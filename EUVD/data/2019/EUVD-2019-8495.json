A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can change a SIP peer's IP address. A REGISTER does not need to occur, and calls can be hijacked as a result. The only thing that needs to be known is the peer's name; authentication details such as passwords do not need to be known. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is set to the default, or auto_force_rport.", "datePublished": "2019-11-22T16:22:55", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:02:38", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.asterisk.org/downloads/security-advisories", "http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2019-006.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/11/msg00038.html", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/04/msg00001.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-18790"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 7.42, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "36df1d6b-15ff-3fb3-9bea-1142c77c351c", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5132965d-1893-32db-b98e-bb02084bd10d", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
