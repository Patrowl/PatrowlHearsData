{"id": "EUVD-2019-10279", "enisaUuid": "8bcc1f28-8fd5-3e6d-89ce-efa4007839b9", "description": "A vulnerability in the FindMe feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended for a specific user. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors. This vulnerability is fixed in software version X12.5.1 and later.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T00:20:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:39:59", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ex-vcs-xsrf", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108006"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1722"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.12, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ee989406-7775-3b08-8f60-bc8e11a6447d", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <X12.5.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9d1d6031-9afc-3412-a490-c0128198cb40", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
