{"id": "EUVD-2019-6883", "enisaUuid": "1af35d40-6eba-3b81-984a-1d32434bd9f6", "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains a specific BGP attribute. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending BGP update messages that include a specific, malformed attribute to be processed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. The Cisco implementation of BGP accepts incoming BGP traffic only from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, the malicious BGP update message would need to come from a configured, valid BGP peer or would need to be injected by the attacker into the victim&rsquo;s BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:30:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:46:50", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-ios-xr-bgp-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15989"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "030ed1e2-a20f-3b41-a435-61d266baf31f", "product": {"name": "Cisco IOS XR Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b57b15fb-c7fa-346b-a766-1214fe7f6b28", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
