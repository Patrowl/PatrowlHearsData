A key-generation process, during evaluation of polynomials related to a to-be-proven statement, produced certain bypass elements. Availability of these elements allowed a cheating prover to bypass a consistency check, and consequently transform the proof of one statement into an ostensibly valid proof of a different statement, thereby breaking the soundness of the proof system. This misled the original Sprout zk-SNARK verifier into accepting the correctness of a transaction.", "datePublished": "2019-03-27T01:37:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T20:38:33", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["http://fortune.com/2019/02/05/zcash-vulnerability-cryptocurrency/", "https://z.cash/blog/zcash-counterfeiting-vulnerability-successfully-remediated/", "https://github.com/JinBean/CVE-Extension"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-7167"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.69, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "050f251a-2c2a-3179-b028-45eda66f3618", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "75dc3685-6126-37e4-93a6-64a929f4e7fe", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
