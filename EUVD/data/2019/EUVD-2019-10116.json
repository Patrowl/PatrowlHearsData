{"id": "EUVD-2019-10116", "enisaUuid": "896d1975-2ace-3662-8cb1-985baccc4343", "description": "If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one) then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order for this to be exploitable \"non-stitched\" ciphersuites must be in use. Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).", "datePublished": "2019-02-27T23:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T04:20:35", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-1559.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4400", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0547", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3931", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3929", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2471", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2439", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2437", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2304", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-1559", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-1559.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-1559", "https://alas.aws.amazon.com/cve/html/CVE-2019-1559.html", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-1559.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107174", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-10", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/3899-1/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/03/msg00003.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-03/msg00041.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00019.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00046.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00047.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-05/msg00049.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-06/msg00080.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EWC42UXL5GHTU5G77VKBF6JYUUNGSHOM/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZBEV5QGDRFUZDMNECFXUSN5FMYOZDE4V/", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Y3IVFGSERAZLNJCK35TEM2R4726XIH3Z/", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html", "https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4376-2/", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190301-0001/", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190301-0002/", "https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git%3Ba=commitdiff%3Bh=e9bbefbf0f24c57645e7ad6a5a71ae649d18ac8e", "https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20190226.txt", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K18549143", "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-02", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190423-0002/", "https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2019-03", "https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10282", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K18549143?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1559"], "assigner": "openssl", "epss": 4.96, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "40d74118-1249-3659-b953-466125a3d584", "product": {"name": "OpenSSL"}, "product_version": "Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3493320d-e1d0-36d8-b5be-f4b90f4a1659", "vendor": {"name": "OpenSSL"}}], "isExploited": false}
