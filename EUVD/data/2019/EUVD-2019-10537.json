The vulnerability is due to improper detection of the initial use of a protocol on a nonstandard port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic on a nonstandard port for the protocol in use through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass filtering and deliver malicious requests to protected systems that would otherwise be blocked. Once the initial protocol flow on the nonstandard port is detected, future flows on the nonstandard port will be successfully detected and handled as configured by the applied policy.", "datePublished": "2019-11-05T19:35:41", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:52:10", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190816-ftd-nspd"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1980"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "ff966774-f2c6-3cc4-bb7c-092da02cb13b", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e58649ea-d182-3954-9321-6f31a29f6b6b", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
