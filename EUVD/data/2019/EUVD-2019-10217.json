The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access and authentication controls on the affected TMS software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to internal, trusted networks to send crafted SOAP calls to the affected device. If successful, an exploit could allow the attacker to access system management tools. Under normal circumstances, this access should be prohibited.", "datePublished": "2019-02-07T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:17:16", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-tms-soap", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106918"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1660"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.59, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "92f8f645-7ab0-3266-ab79-aea086a099a4", "product": {"name": "Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS)"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b5dda922-2bd7-3e53-bb2e-de80bb0a861a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
