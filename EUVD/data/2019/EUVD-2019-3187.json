Extended Inquiry Responses (EIRs) are improperly handled, which causes a heap-based buffer overflow during device inquiry. This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx(), and are included in an EIR's length. Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victim's Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption, the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a write-what-where condition.", "datePublished": "2020-02-05T16:01:49", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T22:55:40", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2019-08-01", "https://www.cisecurity.org/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-google-android-os-could-allow-for-arbitrary-code-execution_2019-078/", "https://www.techrepublic.com/article/android-security-bulletin-august-2019-what-you-need-to-know/", "https://community.cypress.com/thread/53681"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-11516"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.62, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bc4578a5-a53a-3c8e-9657-09f07685f916", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "0317102a-5914-3dce-91e8-fba704fe7dd5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
