The vulnerability is due to an incorrect length check when the configured ACL name is the maximum length, which is 32 ASCII characters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform SNMP polling that should have been denied. The attacker has no control of the configuration of the SNMP ACL name.", "datePublished": "2019-08-29T21:50:19", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:57:58", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-snmp-bypass"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1969"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e1ace35b-080d-36f3-be08-2421ae71ad5d", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.2(3)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b681d8f9-1bdf-3ae2-a970-7cdaf0229271", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
