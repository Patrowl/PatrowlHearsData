The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-02-07T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:46:00", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106927", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-fmc-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1671"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2df7d550-bbfc-334c-ace6-86902a350ef5", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.1"}, {"id": "940a3c70-b2ae-3d8b-b704-46452cf57a72", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.2"}, {"id": "b0753e15-97fb-38fc-8d3b-d8e992d82dc7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.0"}, {"id": "e6c6347a-f239-3844-8ab7-e20c9be3c544", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.4"}, {"id": "f77f3b51-d73a-3c0f-acdf-b8042b83aad8", "product": {"name": "Cisco Firepower Management Center"}, "product_version": "6.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4fbe775-e457-3612-8c1f-cd536dd67d9d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
