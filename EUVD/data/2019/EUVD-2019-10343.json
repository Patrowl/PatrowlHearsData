The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-04-08T19:05:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:12:41", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-1786.html", "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12149", "https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12168", "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201904-12"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1786"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 6.67, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6e01a15c-5a00-3307-a220-aed9fe647362", "product": {"name": "clamav"}, "product_version": "0.101.0"}, {"id": "c14e81e8-8285-39e1-b287-431c9ba0b01f", "product": {"name": "clamav"}, "product_version": "0.101.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "180c91a4-b576-3eaa-b7e6-fb906b675823", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
