This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to a certain CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of the affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit these vulnerabilities.", "datePublished": "2019-05-16T01:25:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:18:02", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-overflow-inj", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108386"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1768"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fc7d5194-23d0-3e17-8316-763bfc1bdd3b", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "72cd3a16-cae0-383c-96a1-4104a232837d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
