The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding specific strings to multiple configuration fields. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-06-20T03:00:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:20:37", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-psc-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108836"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1875"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "fb49e0dc-ca5c-3cd1-86c6-70817355bb86", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Service Catalog"}, "product_version": "unspecified <12.1_Patch_v10"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "83465ded-f346-3afc-a76a-8eeeaa815837", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
