The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an interface user to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the device with the privileges of the user. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.135.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T01:05:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:37:57", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-wlc-csrf", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107998"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1797"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7129d437-d5c0-3814-afee-6682c0f9e549", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3.150.0"}, {"id": "c19af857-1bbc-3670-b894-bfc46593f5da", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.5.135.0"}, {"id": "f0cc20e0-b198-3a52-a6e8-5c76e3f82268", "product": {"name": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.8.100.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7b0c76d7-4790-3c01-ba1f-0629700aef07", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
