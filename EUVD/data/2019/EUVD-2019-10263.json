The vulnerability is due to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:10:29", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:08:47", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ipsec-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1706"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a5cb2910-ffcc-3501-b071-fa1da34c81af", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.9.2.50"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6a20880e-ae24-3a8f-a0c7-ee27e232534c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
