The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in one of the configuration fields. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T07:30:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:17:27", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-spa112-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1956"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b2aa4686-0180-33a3-81ff-419ae393fb26", "product": {"name": "Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8d8a6115-8269-3fa4-b96f-ed5a5288718d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
