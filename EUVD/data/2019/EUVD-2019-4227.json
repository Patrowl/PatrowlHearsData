The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-10-16T18:36:26", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:09:59", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191016-sbss-csrf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12636"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7ca5e8a7-01a1-3b92-ba94-b7a101c201d7", "product": {"name": "Cisco Small Business 250 Series Smart Switches Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "da4a2cae-88d8-3cd2-abe5-4a943e344c80", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
