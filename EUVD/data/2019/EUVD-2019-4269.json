The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SIP packet through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an integer underflow, causing the software to try to read unmapped memory and resulting in a crash.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:40", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T18:54:30", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-sip-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12678"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.92, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5ebcaf4e-0e3f-3081-b034-0dc2d35086fb", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "48ae42a0-a973-3b69-872d-173c41a4db2a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
