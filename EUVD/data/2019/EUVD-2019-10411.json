The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass security restrictions and access the web interface of a Cisco Unified Communications Manager associated with the affected device. Valid credentials would still be required to access the Cisco Unified Communications Manager interface.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T16:35:14", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:32:50", "baseScore": 4.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/cve/CVE-2019-1854", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-expressway-traversal", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108154", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/28", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/49", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152963/Cisco-Expressway-Gateway-11.5.1-Directory-Traversal.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1854"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.06, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a560845-7f05-3209-8c4e-1340dab3284e", "product": {"name": "Cisco Expressway"}, "product_version": "unspecified <X12.5.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "eeb9a59b-0017-3c8d-aa14-4dc6e54c8017", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
