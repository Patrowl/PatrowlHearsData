The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-11-26T03:42:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:04:15", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191120-ucdm-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-15968"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.29, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "678352e5-84e8-3807-86ad-dde79caa6769", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4c495a68-4ed1-3b29-a01e-a272da81c4eb", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
