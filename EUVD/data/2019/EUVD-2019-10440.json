The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the command-line interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with read-only privileges via the CLI of an affected device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.", "datePublished": "2019-08-21T18:20:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:11:30", "baseScore": 7.0, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190821-cimc-cli-inject"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1883"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d5215f00-ce2e-3c7c-b19f-2e18769b0915", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Software (UCSE)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <3.0(4k)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e10e2310-a62c-35c5-98c1-24cd448b0164", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
