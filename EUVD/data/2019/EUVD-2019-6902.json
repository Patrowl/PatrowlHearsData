The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-03-19T15:35:33", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:32:45", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200318-vmanage-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16010"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2d61543b-2886-3746-8ac8-1cf1878c209c", "product": {"name": "Cisco vManage Software"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "c02d328f-343e-325e-9a90-697ea24888ce", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
