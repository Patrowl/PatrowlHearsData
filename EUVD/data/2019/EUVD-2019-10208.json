The vulnerability is due to improper bounds checking by the vContainer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious file to an affected vContainer instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected vContainer, which could result in a DoS condition that the attacker could use to execute arbitrary code as the root user.", "datePublished": "2019-01-24T15:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:28:19", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106703", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-sdwan-bo"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1651"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 2.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c92b318a-9b99-33d8-8940-68ba282a781e", "product": {"name": "Cisco SD-WAN Solution"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1ab564f6-6b7f-35a6-94f3-66ab6770beca", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
