This is fixed in version 1.0.1 of the extension. Users should upgrade to this version using Visual Studio Code Marketplace's upgrade mechanism. After upgrading, the codeQL.cli.executablePath setting can only be set in the per-user settings, and not in the per-workspace settings. More information about VS Code settings can be found here.", "datePublished": "2019-11-25T17:41:17", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:24:47", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/security/advisories/GHSA-wf4x-8mpj-r42q", "https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/pull/174", "https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql/blob/v1.0.1/CHANGELOG.md"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16765"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "2a05a645-a39a-312e-93e5-6979e48a70ff", "product": {"name": "vscode-codeql"}, "product_version": "< 1.0.1 <1.0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "1aab2d4b-7557-3a70-a81b-f0a4cc25dfb0", "vendor": {"name": "GitHub"}}], "isExploited": false}
