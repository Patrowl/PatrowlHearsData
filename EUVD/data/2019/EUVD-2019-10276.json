The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco ISE software version 2.1 is affected.", "datePublished": "2019-04-18T00:15:15", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:40:10", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ise-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107993"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1719"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c9f84dfb-6222-3b38-91f1-a48d6d9d1942", "product": {"name": "Cisco Identity Services Engine Software"}, "product_version": "2.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "50984138-c854-326d-84f4-fd594ce522ed", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
