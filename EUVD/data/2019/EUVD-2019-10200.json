The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-23T23:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:47:57", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-cpi-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106702"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1643"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.16, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4fdae12a-94d9-3042-bc85-cf788710c81a", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4a9c5698-3b6a-3cbe-8c3b-29df2e86194d", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
