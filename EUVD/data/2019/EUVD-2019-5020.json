When using SASL authentication and session encryption, and relying on the SASL security layers in slapd access controls, it is possible to obtain access that would otherwise be denied via a simple bind for any identity covered in those ACLs. After the first SASL bind is completed, the sasl_ssf value is retained for all new non-SASL connections. Depending on the ACL configuration, this can affect different types of operations (searches, modifications, etc.). In other words, a successful authorization step completed by one user affects the authorization requirement for a different user.", "datePublished": "2019-07-26T12:30:58", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:57:39", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-13565.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-13565", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-13565.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-1/", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00024.html", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4078-2/", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00053.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-09/msg00058.html", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/23", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Dec/26", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r1b103833cb5bc8466e24ff0ecc5e75b45a705334ab6a444e64e840a0%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT210788", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf4c02775860db415b4955778a131c2795223f61cb8c6a450893651e4%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r58af02e294bd07f487e2c64ffc0a29b837db5600e33b6e698b9d696b%40%3Cissues.bookkeeper.apache.org%3E", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-announce/201907/msg00001.html", "https://www.openldap.org/its/index.cgi/?findid=9052", "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K98008862?utm_source=f5support&amp%3Butm_medium=RSS"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13565"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.13, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1fd06aba-f3b7-3e77-a02a-6823ff06d4f8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5dcfe49d-49bc-3a52-9099-db4b33008a9c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
