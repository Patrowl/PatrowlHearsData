{"id": "EUVD-2019-6915", "enisaUuid": "1bd033b3-08f2-33ae-b374-7ef8e57b43ae", "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on Cisco Mobility Management Entity (MME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an eNodeB that is connected to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SCTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position between the eNodeB and the MME and then sending a crafted SCTP message to the MME. A successful exploit would cause the MME to stop sending SCTP messages to the eNodeB, triggering a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:45:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:44:37", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-mme-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16026"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.7, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "486c3c8d-782e-3139-80b3-27ca85ac34c8", "product": {"name": "Cisco ASR 5000 Series Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "3f489fec-cbe2-31f7-855b-a946766b5c6c", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
