This can lead to a variety of different issues but read out of array bounds is one major consequence of these problems.", "datePublished": "2019-09-12T17:25:54", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:03:32", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549192"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-11774"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 0.46, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d124eceb-f1c2-32f0-8560-ad4f2b730fe6", "product": {"name": "Eclipse OMR"}, "product_version": "unspecified <0.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "8bc4f03c-4dd2-37df-a0c9-fb7431d05d4a", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
