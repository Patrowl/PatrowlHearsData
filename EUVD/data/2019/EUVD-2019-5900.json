The pre-installed Note application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. A local attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the Note application. At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Note application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.", "datePublished": "2020-09-14T19:24:07", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:38", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/", "https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/21/technical-advisory-multiple-html-injection-vulnerabilities-in-kaios-pre-installed-mobile-applications/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14761"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.1, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f4048e55-1aaf-39bd-af2f-53a22cd0cded", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "9cea961e-7765-337c-8e7c-deb480395296", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
