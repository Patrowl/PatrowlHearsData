The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of SSL-encrypted traffic when Decrypt for End-User Notification is disabled in the configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SSL connection through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured drop policy to block specific SSL connections. Releases 10.1.x and 10.5.x are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-02-08T18:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:17:07", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190206-wsa-bypass", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106904"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1672"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "460496e0-59c9-3dc9-b5a9-b56d89dd4850", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "10.5"}, {"id": "b75b615b-ee5a-3aa3-bf44-771ea48f28c1", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "10.1"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f076776d-946b-33c0-b90b-bcccd28cbc0f", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
