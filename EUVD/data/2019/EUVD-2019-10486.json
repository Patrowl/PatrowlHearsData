The vulnerabilities exist because the affected software improperly validates Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and Webex Recording Format (WRF) files. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2019-08-07T21:20:21", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-20T17:13:55", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-webex-player"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1929"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.3, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "80830786-7b0c-3399-b550-f39be91cbd59", "product": {"name": "Cisco WebEx WRF Player"}, "product_version": "unspecified <39.5.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "489abb69-242a-398d-afa1-b7c19bdc33b5", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
