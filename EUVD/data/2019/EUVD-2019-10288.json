{"id": "EUVD-2019-10288", "enisaUuid": "07b425fa-3b34-3282-a8b4-fa9c27af9c18", "description": "A vulnerability in the SSH CLI key management functionality of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to expose a user's private SSH key to all authenticated users on the targeted device. The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator device credentials. The vulnerability is due to incomplete error handling if a specific error type occurs during the SSH key export. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to expose a user's private SSH key. In addition, a similar type of error in the SSH key import could cause the passphrase-protected private SSH key to be imported unintentionally.", "datePublished": "2019-05-15T16:50:36", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:30:56", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-nxos-ssh-info", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108353"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1731"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "c8d94698-7c5b-31d7-b3ef-44ae786d3683", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.3(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b818166b-dab4-3a2e-a495-6bfa98fe696e", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
