It does not sufficiently check uploaded archives for invalid data, potentially allowing non-configuration scripts to be uploaded to the server. (This attack is mitigated by the attacker needing the \"Synchronize, import, and export configuration\" permission, a permission that only trusted administrators should be given. Other preventative measures in Backdrop CMS prevent the execution of PHP scripts, so another server-side scripting language must be accessible on the server to execute code.) Note: This has been disputed by multiple 3rd parties due to advanced permissions that are needed to exploit.", "datePublished": "2019-08-08T01:35:48", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:38", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://backdropcms.org/security/backdrop-sa-core-2019-012"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14771"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.98, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f4f9bb4e-2067-3444-a876-5b7c62e62cf7", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5ad28397-cda6-3252-929e-bcece18047d2", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
