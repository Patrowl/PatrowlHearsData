The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in multiple sections of the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:52", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:11:23", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-pi-xss-12712"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-12712"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.15, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "7d3f7502-57da-37c4-af7b-2cd09b6370e3", "product": {"name": "Cisco Prime Infrastructure"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "61d6cce7-feba-3953-98db-b027fcdde890", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
