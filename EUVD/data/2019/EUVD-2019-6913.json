The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:45:25", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:44:27", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-cnca-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16024"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.23, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "6a1546a8-bae0-3142-b0da-50543f60d8d9", "product": {"name": "Cisco Crosswork Network Change Automation"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "dac42243-bcb0-3ee9-91b4-160fb1111e9a", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
