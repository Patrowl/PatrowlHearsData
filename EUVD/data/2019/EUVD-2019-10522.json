This can lead to a build-up of VSH processes that overtime can deplete system memory. When there is no system memory available, this can cause unexpected system behaviors and crashes. The vulnerability is due to the VSH process not being properly deleted when a remote management connection to the device is disconnected. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly performing a remote management connection to the device and terminating the connection in an unexpected manner. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the VSH processes to fail to delete, which can lead to a system-wide denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the device using the remote management connection.", "datePublished": "2019-08-28T18:55:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:15:13", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190828-nxos-memleak-dos"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1965"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 1.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "479a12af-6267-355f-8bd5-1beac7a01569", "product": {"name": "Cisco NX-OS Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <8.4(1)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "91f5598e-fae4-3721-9f89-aad9d143f3da", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
