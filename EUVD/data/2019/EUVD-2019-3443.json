This can lead to a variety of different issues but read out of array bounds is one major consequence of these problems.", "datePublished": "2019-07-30T13:45:38", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:03:32", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-11775.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2737", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2592", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2590", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2585", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2495", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2494", "https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549601"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-11775"], "assigner": "eclipse", "epss": 1.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "69464e70-49ea-347a-aff2-cd267220f3b7", "product": {"name": "Eclipse OpenJ9"}, "product_version": "unspecified <0.15.0"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "73ff393f-d363-3d5b-bdcc-f18bc45ef11a", "vendor": {"name": "The Eclipse Foundation"}}], "isExploited": false}
