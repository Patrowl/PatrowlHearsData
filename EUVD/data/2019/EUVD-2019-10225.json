This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input delivered to the chat feed as part of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link to attacker-controlled content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.", "datePublished": "2019-01-24T16:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:46:59", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-miner-chat-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106720"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1668"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.28, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4641cb9e-7ede-3aae-af90-69fa75299919", "product": {"name": "Cisco SocialMiner"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b4e919a0-bb36-3406-b444-07568d6a2630", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
