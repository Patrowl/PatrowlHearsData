It extracts a ZIP archive before checking its content, and once it has been extracted, does not check files in a recursive way. This means that by putting a .php file in a folder and then this folder in a ZIP archive, the server will accept this file without any checks. Because one can access this file from the website, it is remote code execution. This is related to a scorm imsmanifest.xml file, the import_package function, and extraction in $courseSysDir.$newDir.", "datePublished": "2019-06-30T15:07:27", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-04T23:41:10", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "references": ["https://0xecute.com/?p=32", "https://support.chamilo.org/projects/1/wiki/Security_issues"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-13082"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.51, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e0677e98-3b44-353d-ae4f-e93eec84736e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7783a8d2-1d9f-315a-8f99-bfe34a31c95c", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
