The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information on the affected system.", "datePublished": "2020-01-26T04:40:20", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-15T17:44:56", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200108-dcaf-xss"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16015"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.32, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "14873a00-86a0-37d1-9102-5fe420518f19", "product": {"name": "Cisco Data Center Analytics Framework"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "11d67a8e-5cc2-30ab-9daf-f254b191bfee", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
