The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information. Cisco DNA Center versions prior to 1.2.5 are affected.", "datePublished": "2019-03-11T22:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:42:24", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-dna-xss", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107315"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1707"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.17, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "4923dd7d-2acd-3b1b-9e91-24c93a400c6c", "product": {"name": "Cisco Digital Network Architecture Center (DNA Center)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <1.2.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "72ccde0d-9815-3722-bde9-0b6b95162739", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
