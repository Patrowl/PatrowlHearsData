It fails to prevent access to folders outside of the intended node_modules folder through the bin field. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to modify and/or gain access to arbitrary files on a user's system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.", "datePublished": "2019-12-13T00:55:16", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T01:24:48", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://github.com/npm/cli/security/advisories/GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16776", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2020:0330", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0573", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0579", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0597", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0602", "https://blog.npmjs.org/post/189618601100/binary-planting-with-the-npm-cli", "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z36UKPO5F3PQ3Q2POMF5LEKXWAH5RUFP", "https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1436", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html", "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00027.html", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-16776.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:2625", "https://advisories.mageia.org/CVE-2019-16776.html", "https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-16776", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-16776.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Z36UKPO5F3PQ3Q2POMF5LEKXWAH5RUFP/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-16776", "GHSA-x8qc-rrcw-4r46"], "assigner": "GitHub_M", "epss": 0.35, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e9818cc4-bd17-3666-8f24-8b544750ac36", "product": {"name": "cli"}, "product_version": "< 6.13.3 <6.13.3"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ae2476ad-179a-31bf-8197-a1b600a4be68", "vendor": {"name": "npm"}}], "isExploited": false}
