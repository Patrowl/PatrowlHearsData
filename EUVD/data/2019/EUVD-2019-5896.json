The pre-installed Contacts application is vulnerable to HTML and JavaScript injection attacks. An attacker can send a vCard file to the victim that will inject HTML into the Contacts application (assuming the victim chooses to import the file). At a bare minimum, this allows an attacker to take control over the Contacts application's UI (e.g., display a malicious prompt to the user asking them to re-enter credentials such as their KaiOS credentials to continue using the application) and also allows an attacker to abuse any of the privileges available to the mobile application.", "datePublished": "2020-09-14T19:07:13", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T00:26:38", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseScoreVersion": "3.1", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "references": ["https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/", "https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/08/21/technical-advisory-multiple-html-injection-vulnerabilities-in-kaios-pre-installed-mobile-applications/"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-14757"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.24, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "739b308d-30f8-388d-99d8-85d211beefa0", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "72a7001b-531d-3c3e-b573-6738a4ff15df", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
