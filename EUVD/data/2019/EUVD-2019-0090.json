By setting a destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol that doesn't support that option (for example, VRRP), an authenticated user may block further application of security group rules for instances from any project/tenant on the compute hosts to which it's applied. (Only deployments using the iptables security group driver are affected.)", "datePublished": "2019-03-13T02:29:00", "dateUpdated": "2021-08-27T03:22:08", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://launchpad.net/bugs/1818385", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107390", "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4409", "https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2019-001.html", "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Mar/24", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/03/18/2", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0935", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0916", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:0879", "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4036-1/", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-9735", "https://github.com/openstack/neutron", "https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/tree/main/vulns/neutron/PYSEC-2019-190.yaml", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201208185619/http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107390", "https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9735.html", "https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-9735"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-9735", "PYSEC-2019-190"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 2.0, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "d3a7842f-5f29-31c3-9cc7-f2d219f126c4", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "198e13df-29bd-39b1-ba4a-0d9f4180af49", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
