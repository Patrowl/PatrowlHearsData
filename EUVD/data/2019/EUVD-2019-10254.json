The vulnerabilities are due to the improper parsing of LDAP packets sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted LDAP packet, using Basic Encoding Rules (BER), to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.", "datePublished": "2019-05-03T15:15:22", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:35:18", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftds-ldapdos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108182"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1697"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.5, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "1674ebf6-36af-3c82-b29c-e41c707d5645", "product": {"name": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software"}, "product_version": "unspecified <9.6(4.21)"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "4e4b356e-d55c-3ee0-b04f-552e26902ea0", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
