The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) server certificates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a malformed certificate in a web server and sending a request to it through the Cisco WSA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the proxy process on an affected device.", "datePublished": "2019-07-04T19:50:10", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-19T19:03:49", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190703-wsa-dos", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109049"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1886"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.85, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "e269395c-a9b0-313f-9f99-dc19e9ff3109", "product": {"name": "Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)"}, "product_version": "unspecified <10.5.5-005"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "fb984667-efcc-3cec-b1c4-1f640180c537", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
