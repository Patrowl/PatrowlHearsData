The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary requests that could change the password of a targeted user. An attacker could then take unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.", "datePublished": "2019-10-02T19:06:56", "dateUpdated": "2024-11-21T19:10:23", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "references": ["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-cucm-csrf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1915"], "assigner": "cisco", "epss": 0.18, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "22410c82-276b-36b7-98d3-547dfda3d513", "product": {"name": "Cisco Unified Communications Manager"}, "product_version": "unspecified <n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "41e4726f-1c73-3f54-9e9a-221616066e60", "vendor": {"name": "Cisco"}}], "isExploited": false}
