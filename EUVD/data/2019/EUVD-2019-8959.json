When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA_NO=0), but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS_NO=1), the guest was to clear the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism. But when the MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, the guests did not use the VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has 'TSX' enabled. Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability.", "datePublished": "2020-07-13T16:04:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-05T02:16:46", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-19338.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1465", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0839", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0834", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0339", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0328", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2019-19338.html", "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/10/3", "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-19338", "https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intel-tsx-asynchronous-abort"], "aliases": ["CVE-2019-19338"], "assigner": "redhat", "epss": 0.09, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5a6c4196-dde1-3ac8-9925-bb3f78fc4e91", "product": {"name": "Linux kernel"}, "product_version": "before 5.5"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "7aab41a7-4644-379d-9dc2-b4474d168f2d", "vendor": {"name": "[UNKNOWN]"}}], "isExploited": false}
