Authenticated users can upload files to the mods/documents/uploads/ directory without any restriction on file type or extension. Because this directory is publicly accessible and lacks execution controls, attackers can upload a malicious PHP payload and execute it remotely. The application ships with default credentials, making exploitation trivial. Once authenticated, the attacker can upload a PHP shell and trigger it via a direct GET request.", "datePublished": "2025-08-13T20:51:21", "dateUpdated": "2025-08-14T14:52:38", "baseScore": 8.7, "baseScoreVersion": "4.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "references": ["https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvolunteer/", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/master/modules/exploits/multi/http/php_volunteer_upload_exec.rb", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18941", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18957", "https://www.vulncheck.com/advisories/php-volunteer-management-system-arbitrary-file-upload"], "aliases": ["CVE-2012-10056"], "assigner": "VulnCheck", "epss": 51.86, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "31b424c1-3801-3244-996f-3acb04d2f1fc", "product": {"name": "PHP Volunteer Management"}, "product_version": "1.0.2"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2ac50908-9b03-312c-873f-752cd87cc9cf", "vendor": {"name": "PHP Volunteer Management"}}], "isExploited": false}
