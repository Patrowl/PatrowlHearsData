NOTE: the approach to changing this may not be fully compatible with certain use cases, such as migration of a WordPress site from a web host that uses a recent PHP version to a different web host that uses PHP 5.2. These use cases are plausible (but very unlikely) based on statistics showing widespread deployment of WordPress with obsolete PHP versions.", "datePublished": "2017-10-19T19:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-09-17T00:51:05", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "3.0", "baseScoreVector": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "references": ["https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21022"], "aliases": ["CVE-2012-6707"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "5261c875-87c7-3eb5-bd42-6505f2d6c5f8", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "178e4a61-1098-353a-9445-ecd233ec81cd", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
