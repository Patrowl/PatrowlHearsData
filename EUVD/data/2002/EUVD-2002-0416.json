NOTE: this entry originally contained a vector (1) in which the server reveals whether it supports Basic or NTLM authentication through 401 Access Denied error messages.  CVE has REJECTED this vector; it is not a vulnerability because the information is already available through legitimate use, since authentication cannot proceed without specifying a scheme that is supported by both the client and the server.", "datePublished": "2002-06-11T04:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-08T02:49:28", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/4235", "http://www.iss.net/security_center/static/8382.php", "http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=101535399100534&w=2"], "aliases": ["CVE-2002-0419"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 47.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "b8c8f379-475a-3fa8-b0d3-d71b0ff75d70", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "00d47aad-212a-3734-bf14-1c76c5cac3a6", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
