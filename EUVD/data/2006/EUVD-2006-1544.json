NOTE: after the initial disclosure, this issue was demonstrated by triggering an integer overflow using an inconsistent size for a Unicode \"Sheet Name\" string.", "datePublished": "2006-03-30T11:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T17:19:47", "baseScore": 9.3, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/439697/100/0/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21012", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/2756", "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2006/ms06-038", "http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/609868", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/27607", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/27609", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17252", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18889", "http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA06-192A.html", "http://www.osvdb.org/27150", "https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A639", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1615", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1015855"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-1540"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 74.66, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f362f076-cd89-3895-b9cb-b5b2cadac3e5", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "2f34a288-2165-300f-8a80-67e6533bfa1e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
