NOTE: it was later reported that the ecrire.php vector also affects 1.2.  NOTE: this issue might be limited to a race condition during installation or an improper installation, since a completed installation creates an include file that prevents external control of the $lang variable.", "datePublished": "2006-06-23T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T18:16:06", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/27114", "http://www.osvdb.org/27460", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18476", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/437448/100/0/threaded", "http://www.osvdb.org/27461", "http://securityreason.com/securityalert/1125", "http://www.osvdb.org/27462", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/437028/100/200/threaded"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-3175"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 7.26, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "61c5f681-8a2b-3c51-b4e4-6d471f315a77", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "6e8f8f41-22c2-31e3-8d41-b2f41eaad5f5", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
