NOTE: since htpasswd is normally installed as a non-setuid program, and the exploit is through command line options, perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.  However, if there are some typical or recommended configurations that use htpasswd with sudo privileges, or common products that access htpasswd remotely, then perhaps it should be included.", "datePublished": "2006-03-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T16:56:15", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/426823/100/0/threaded", "http://marc.info/?l=thttpd&m=114154083000296&w=2", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/25217", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16972", "http://www.osvdb.org/23828", "http://marc.info/?l=thttpd&m=114153031201867&w=2", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Nov/13", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/175949/m-privacy-TightGate-Pro-Code-Execution-Insecure-Permissions.html"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-1079"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.19, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "8623ae30-8479-3e58-882e-eb0b7dd3a776", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "a3621c99-d03c-32c1-bb3d-4ed3ae39568a", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
