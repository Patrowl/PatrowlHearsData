NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability. However, the fact that it appears in a programming language interpreter could mean that some applications are affected, although attack scenarios might be limited because the attacker might already need to cross privilege boundaries to cause an exploitable program to be placed in a directory with a long name; or, depending on the method that Python uses to determine the current working directory, setuid applications might be affected.", "datePublished": "2006-03-30T11:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T17:19:47", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1542.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008:0629", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008:0525", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2008:0264", "http://secunia.com/advisories/31492", "http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2008-0629.html", "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1591", "http://www.gotfault.net/research/exploit/gexp-python.py"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-1542"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.22, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "33a3ab1e-2b52-30be-83e3-89ada131777f", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "5a593a18-bdf9-3bd4-863e-9e1eb1f82572", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
