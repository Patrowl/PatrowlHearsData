Details will be updated after the grace period has ended.  NOTE: SAP Business Connector is an OEM version of webMethods Integration Server.  webMethods states that this issue can only occur when the product is installed as root/admin, and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port; however, both are discouraged in the documentation.  In addition, the attacker must already have acquired administrative privileges through other means.", "datePublished": "2006-02-16T11:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T16:48:55", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N", "references": ["http://secunia.com/advisories/18880", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/434014/30/4980/threaded", "http://www.cybsec.com/vuln/CYBSEC_Security_Advisory_Arbitrary_File_Read_or_Delete_in_SAP_BC.pdf", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1016122", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16668", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1016090", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1015639", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/425048/100/0/threaded", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/0611", "http://www.cybsec.com/vuln/CYBSEC_Security_Pre-Advisory_Arbitrary_File_Read_or_Delete_in_SAP_BC.pdf"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-0732"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 3.08, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "9a613972-2c2f-3a64-a690-1fdc100dda7e", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "d57b30e0-1e41-37aa-b2cc-8257e1af2097", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
