{"id": "EUVD-2006-4241", "enisaUuid": "676b8a28-d3ab-362c-8dfd-b7362e6b7066", "description": "Concurrency vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple Javascript timed events that load a deeply nested XML file, followed by redirecting the browser to another page, which leads to a concurrency failure that causes structures to be freed incorrectly, as demonstrated by (1) ffoxdie and (2) ffoxdie3.  NOTE: it has been reported that Netscape 8.1 and K-Meleon 1.0.1 are also affected by ffoxdie.  Mozilla confirmed to CVE that ffoxdie and ffoxdie3 trigger the same underlying vulnerability.  NOTE: it was later reported that Firefox 2.0 RC2 and 1.5.0.7 are also affected.", "datePublished": "2006-08-21T20:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T19:06:07", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "references": ["https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4253.html", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006:0677", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006:0676", "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2006:0675", "https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2006-4253.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/448956/100/100/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/443500/100/100/threaded", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1016847", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22391", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/3748", "http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2006-0676.html", "http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2006/mfsa2006-59.html", "http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie.html", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22055", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22195", "https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A9528", "http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-352-1", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21513", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21950", "http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-351-1", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22025", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22056", "http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2006:168", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/443020/100/100/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22210", "http://secunia.com/advisories/24711", "http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200610-04.xml", "http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2006-224.htm", "http://www.pianetapc.it/view.php?id=770", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/0083", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/443528/100/0/threaded", "ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20060901-01-P.asc", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21939", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1016848", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/3617", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21915", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/1198", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/447837/100/200/threaded", "http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2006-0677.html", "http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200609-19.xml", "http://www1.itrc.hp.com/service/cki/docDisplay.do?docId=c00771742", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/448984/100/100/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22274", "http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2006-0675.html", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21940", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22001", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/446140/100/0/threaded", "http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-350-1", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21906", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/449245/100/100/threaded", "http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200610-01.xml", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22074", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22066", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22088", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/443306/100/100/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21949", "http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2006_54_mozilla.html", "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=348514", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19534", "https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-640", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/447840/100/200/threaded", "http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffoxdie3.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/449726/100/0/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22036", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1016846", "http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-354-1", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19488", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/449487/100/0/threaded", "http://secunia.com/advisories/22422", "http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2006:169", "http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5VP0M0AJFW.html", "http://secunia.com/advisories/21916"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-4253"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 32.81, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "a2052995-bc62-3cdc-bf71-25366beb03f7", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "b7cbf928-5fbd-33cc-a843-c2a367604185", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
