NOTE: since this is related to a configuration setting that has an operational impact that might vary depending on the environment, and the product is claimed to report a message when the compressed file exceeds specified limits, perhaps this should not be included in CVE.", "datePublished": "2006-02-10T11:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T16:41:29", "baseScore": 5.1, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/0602-advisories/Bypass.pdf", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/424598/100/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/423896/100/0/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16483", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/424172/100/0/threaded", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/24658", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/423914/100/0/threaded", "http://www.packetstormsecurity.org/filedesc/Bypass.pdf.html", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/423913/100/0/threaded"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-0642"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.84, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "f066ecd7-9671-3ed9-8e49-b0b01bede67b", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "f3c6996e-2cb9-36e3-95c0-899a4f41800e", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
