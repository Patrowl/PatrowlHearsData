NOTE: it could be argued that the ip2long behavior represents a risk for security-relevant issues in a way that is similar to strcpy's role in buffer overflows, in which case this would be a class of implementation bugs that would require separate CVE items for each PHP application that uses ip2long in a security-relevant manner.", "datePublished": "2006-08-09T00:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T18:57:43", "baseScore": 5.0, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/441708/100/100/threaded", "http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/441529/100/100/threaded", "http://retrogod.altervista.org/php_ip2long.htm", "http://securitytracker.com/id?1016609"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-4023"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 0.14, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "0a1bf68e-5e36-3077-a757-81b905f77d96", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "ebfd7102-b0d0-3844-abb7-51e27a866d57", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
