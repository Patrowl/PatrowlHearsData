{"id": "EUVD-2006-0370", "enisaUuid": "338a8793-e522-380a-aff8-165c3d9bc19e", "description": "The \"Remember my Password\" feature in MSN Messenger 7.5 stores passwords in an encrypted format under the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\IdentityCRL\\Creds registry key, which might allow local users to obtain the original passwords via a program that calls CryptUnprotectData, as demonstrated by the \"MSN Password Recovery.exe\" program.  NOTE: it could be argued that local-only password recovery is inherently insecure because the decryption methods and keys must be stored somewhere on the local system, and are thus inherently accessible with varying degrees of effort.
