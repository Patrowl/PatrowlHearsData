NOTE: while user-assisted, the attack is made more feasible because of a GUI misrepresentation issue that allows a default message to be replaced by an attacker-specified one.", "datePublished": "2006-03-23T23:00:00", "dateUpdated": "2024-08-07T17:12:20", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseScoreVersion": "2.0", "baseScoreVector": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "references": ["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/428431/100/0/threaded", "https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/25402", "http://secunia.com/advisories/19319", "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17190", "http://www.digitalmunition.com/DMA[2006-0321a].txt", "http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/1045", "http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2006-March/044287.html", "http://www.digitalmunition.com/DMA%5B2006-0321a%5D.txt"], "aliases": ["CVE-2006-1367"], "assigner": "mitre", "epss": 5.2, "enisaIdProduct": [{"id": "bd6de37b-3a61-3279-98d5-48c0b5e2d3dc", "product": {"name": "n/a"}, "product_version": "n/a"}], "enisaIdVendor": [{"id": "e47cf7cf-b53a-3b17-a678-d1472413d08b", "vendor": {"name": "n/a"}}], "isExploited": false}
