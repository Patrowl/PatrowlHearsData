The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\nAn attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge handles objects in memory.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "AND", "children": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:edge:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}, {"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1809:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1903:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1909:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:2004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2019:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}], "cpe_match": []}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "HIGH", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "COMPLETE", "integrityImpact": "COMPLETE", "availabilityImpact": "COMPLETE", "baseScore": 7.6}, "severity": "HIGH", "exploitabilityScore": 4.9, "impactScore": 10.0, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": true}}, "publishedDate": "2020-08-17T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T05:10Z"}
