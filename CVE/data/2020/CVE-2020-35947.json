Nearly all of the AJAX action endpoints lacked permission checks, allowing these actions to be executed by anyone authenticated on the site. This happened because nonces were used as a means of authorization, but a nonce was present in a publicly viewable page. The greatest impact was the pagelayer_save_content function that allowed pages to be modified and allowed XSS to occur."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-01-01T04:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-01-03T23:15Z"}
