In HtmlSanitizer before version 5.0.372, there is a possible XSS bypass if style tag is allowed. If you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag. The problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-01-04T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-01-04T19:48Z"}
