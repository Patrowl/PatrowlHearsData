ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: Red Hat Product Security does not consider this as a security flaw. Password changes aren't expected to invalidate existing sessions. Though this is how Kerberos behaves: incrementing kvno will not invalidate any existing service tickets. This is not a concern because the lifetime on service tickets should be set appropriately (initially only a global, now also more finely configurable with the kdcpolicy plugin). This belief is reinforced by our use of mod_session: existing sessions there aren't terminated, but instead wait for expiration"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2020-06-03T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-11-07T03:19Z"}
