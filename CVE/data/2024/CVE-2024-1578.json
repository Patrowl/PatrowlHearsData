Random characters being dropped from ID card numbers compromises the uniqueness of ID cards that can, therefore, result in a security issue if the users are using the \u2018ID card self-registration\u2019 function."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-16T07:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-16T07:15Z"}
