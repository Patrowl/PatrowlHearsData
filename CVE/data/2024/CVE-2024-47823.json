In livewire/livewire prior to `2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a \u201c.php\u201d file extension. If the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack: 1. Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`. 2. Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk. 3. Webserver is configured to execute \u201c.php\u201d files. This issue has been addressed in release versions `2.12.7` and `3.5.2`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/security/advisories/GHSA-f3cx-396f-7jqp"}, {"name": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/8624", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/pull/8624"}, {"name": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/70503b79f5db75a1eac9bf55826038a6ee5a16d5", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/70503b79f5db75a1eac9bf55826038a6ee5a16d5"}, {"name": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/cd168c6212ea13d13b82b3132485741f82d9fad9", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/livewire/livewire/commit/cd168c6212ea13d13b82b3132485741f82d9fad9"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.7, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
