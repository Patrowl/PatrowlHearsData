Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-58vw-246g-fjj4", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-58vw-246g-fjj4"}, {"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/003b80e62f97cd8c0114d6b9d3f93c10443e6fae", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/003b80e62f97cd8c0114d6b9d3f93c10443e6fae"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-400"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
