Although both client-side and back-end server verification are involved in the process, attackers can exploit weaknesses in its implementation. These vulnerabilities may enable brute-force attacks to guess valid credentials or MD5 collision attacks to forge authentication hashes, potentially compromising the security of the device."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2025-01-15T10:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2025-01-15T10:15Z"}
