A vulnerability in version 8.0 is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use invitations, not single-use invitation links as in the prior CVE. Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-admins to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations, and has also configured only admins to be able to invite users to streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users invite new users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can already see. Version 8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround, administrators can limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the permission to add users to streams."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-87p9-wprh-7rm6", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-87p9-wprh-7rm6"}, {"name": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-mrvp-96q6-jpvc", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/security/advisories/GHSA-mrvp-96q6-jpvc"}, {"name": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/0df7bd71f32f3b772e2646c6ab0d60c9b610addf", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/0df7bd71f32f3b772e2646c6ab0d60c9b610addf"}, {"name": "https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://zulip.com/help/configure-who-can-invite-to-streams"}, {"name": "https://zulip.com/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://zulip.com/help/restrict-account-creation#change-who-can-send-invitations"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-862"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
