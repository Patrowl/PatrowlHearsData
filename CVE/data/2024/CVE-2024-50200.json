Also\nMikhail Gavrilov kindly reported what appears to be precisely the same\nbug, which this fix should also resolve.\n\n\nThis patch (of 2):\n\nThere has been a subtle bug present in the maple tree implementation from\nits inception.\n\nThis arises from how stores are performed - when a store occurs, it will\noverwrite overlapping ranges and adjust the tree as necessary to\naccommodate this.\n\nA range may always ultimately span two leaf nodes.  In this instance we\nwalk the two leaf nodes, determine which elements are not overwritten to\nthe left and to the right of the start and end of the ranges respectively\nand then rebalance the tree to contain these entries and the newly\ninserted one.\n\nThis kind of store is dubbed a 'spanning store' and is implemented by\nmas_wr_spanning_store().\n\nIn order to reach this stage, mas_store_gfp() invokes\nmas_wr_preallocate(), mas_wr_store_type() and mas_wr_walk() in turn to\nwalk the tree and update the object (mas) to traverse to the location\nwhere the write should be performed, determining its store type.\n\nWhen a spanning store is required, this function returns false stopping at\nthe parent node which contains the target range, and mas_wr_store_type()\nmarks the mas->store_type as wr_spanning_store to denote this fact.\n\nWhen we go to perform the store in mas_wr_spanning_store(), we first\ndetermine the elements AFTER the END of the range we wish to store (that\nis, to the right of the entry to be inserted) - we do this by walking to\nthe NEXT pivot in the tree (i.e.  r_mas.last + 1), starting at the node we\nhave just determined contains the range over which we intend to write.\n\nWe then turn our attention to the entries to the left of the entry we are\ninserting, whose state is represented by l_mas, and copy these into a 'big\nnode', which is a special node which contains enough slots to contain two\nleaf node's worth of data.\n\nWe then copy the entry we wish to store immediately after this - the copy\nand the insertion of the new entry is performed by mas_store_b_node().\n\nAfter this we copy the elements to the right of the end of the range which\nwe are inserting, if we have not exceeded the length of the node (i.e. \nr_mas.offset <= r_mas.end).\n\nHerein lies the bug - under very specific circumstances, this logic can\nbreak and corrupt the maple tree.\n\nConsider the following tree:\n\nHeight\n  0                             Root Node\n                                 /      \\\n                 pivot = 0xffff /        \\ pivot = ULONG_MAX\n                               /          \n---truncated---"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-08T06:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-08T19:01Z"}
