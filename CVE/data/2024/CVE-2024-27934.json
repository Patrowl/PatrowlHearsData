Starting in version 1.36.2 and prior to version 1.40.3, use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, resulting in arbitrary code execution. Use of inherently unsafe `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` leads to use-after-free access of the underlying structure, which is exploitable by an attacker controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of permissions. This bug is known to be exploitable for both `*const c_void` and `ExternalPointer` implementations. Version 1.40.3 fixes this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:deno:deno:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "1.36.2", "versionEndExcluding": "1.40.3", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.0, "impactScore": 6.0}}, "publishedDate": "2024-03-21T02:52Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2025-01-03T19:23Z"}
