NOTE: this is disputed by the supplier because the CAN bus is not externally exposed, and because the packets can only increase the odometer reading (which typically has no value to an adversary). Also, this is disputed by the Supplier because the findings came from a potentially unrealistic test environment (an isolated ECU part that was not in a vehicle), and because the observed behavior follows the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) specification."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nitinronge91/KIA-SELTOS-Cluster-Vulnerabilities/blob/0446f6fe6299eb39310e996c73d5513e70d76353/CVE/Odometer%20Manipulation%28Increase%29%20for%20KIA%20SELTOS%20Cluster%20CVE-2024-51074.md"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
