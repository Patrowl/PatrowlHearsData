The labels should be named after what\n  they do, not after the error path that jumps to them. This way, it is\n  obviously wrong that two labels pointing to the same code mean\n  something is wrong, and checking the code correctness at the goto site\n  is also easier ]"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8966eb69a143b1c032365fe84f2815f3c46f2590"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a13e690191eafc154b3f60afe9ce35aa9b9128b4"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.11.*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:8966eb69a143b1c032365fe84f2815f3c46f2590:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:a13e690191eafc154b3f60afe9ce35aa9b9128b4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
