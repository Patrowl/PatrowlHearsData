This should rarely happen as the common use cases\nare to either create a new trusted key and export it, or import a key\nblob and then just use it without exporting it again.\n\nFix this by performing BEK decryption and encryption in a dedicated\nbuffer. Further always wipe the plain text BEK buffer to prevent leaking\nthe key via uninitialized memory."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-04T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-05T12:53Z"}
