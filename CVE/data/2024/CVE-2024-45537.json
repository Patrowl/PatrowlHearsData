This functionality allows trusted users to set up Druid lookups or run ingestion tasks. Druid also allows administrators to configure a list of allowed properties that users are able to provide for their JDBC connections. By default, this allowed properties list restricts users to TLS-related properties only. However, when configuration a MySQL JDBC connection, users can use a particularly-crafted JDBC connection string to provide properties that are not on this allow list.\n\nUsers without the permission to configure JDBC connections are not able to exploit this vulnerability.\nCVE-2021-26919 describes a similar vulnerability which was partially addressed in Apache Druid 0.20.2.\n\nThis issue is fixed in Apache Druid 30.0.1."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-17T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-17T19:15Z"}
