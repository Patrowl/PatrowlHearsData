Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.\nAfter retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/security/advisories/GHSA-qjh3-4j3h-vmwp"}, {"name": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/commit/3c3302258ad510fbca2f8a73731569d91f07d196"}, {"name": "https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-703"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
