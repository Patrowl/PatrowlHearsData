The fence destroy callback\nboth deletes the fence and removes it from the list of pending\nfences, for which it holds a lock.\n\ndma buf polling cb unrefs a fence after it's been signaled: so the poll\ncalls the wait, which signals the fences, which are being destroyed.\nThe destruction tries to acquire the lock on the pending fences list\nwhich it can never get because it's held by the wait from which it\nwas called.\n\nOld bug, but not a lot of userspace apps were using dma-buf polling\ninterfaces.
