An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an SD-WAN IPsec tunnel that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: SD-WAN tunnels that are configured with Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) are not affected by this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-25T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-26T13:32Z"}
