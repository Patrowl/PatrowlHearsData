An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link while establishing a VPN session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser or access sensitive, browser-based information, including a valid SAML token. The attacker could then use the token to establish a remote access VPN session with the privileges of the affected user. Individual hosts and services behind the VPN headend would still need additional credentials for successful access."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-03-06T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:52Z"}
