The file upload widget is vulnerable to XSS payloads in filenames. Access permission to upload files is required.

In effect, an attacker will have to trick an editor/administrator into uploading a strangely named file."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-31T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-31T16:15Z"}
