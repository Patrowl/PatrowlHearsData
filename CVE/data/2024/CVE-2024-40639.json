Prior to version 8.1.0, the default value for the flag `--chromium-deny-list` allowed to display some internal files from the Gotenberg container. Version 8.1.0 provides a new default value fixing the issue. Prior to version 8.1.0, Gotenberg uses the standard `regexp` Go library, which does not support negative lookahead. Therefore, the new default value for the `--chromium-deny-list` is not applicable. However, one could find an alternative using either or both `--chromium-deny-list` and `--chromium-allow-list` flags. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-17T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-17T18:15Z"}
