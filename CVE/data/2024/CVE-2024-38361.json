Use of an exclusion under an arrow that has multiple resources may resolve to `NO_PERMISSION` when permission is expected. If the resource exists under *multiple* folders and the user has access to view more than a single folder, SpiceDB may report the user does not have access due to a failure in the exclusion dispatcher to request that *all* the folders in which the user is a member be returned. Permission is returned as `NO_PERMISSION` when `PERMISSION` is expected on the `CheckPermission` API. This issue has been addressed in version 1.33.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-20T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-21T11:22Z"}
