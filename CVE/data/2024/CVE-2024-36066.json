CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks. Because the standalone CMP client originally was developed as test code, the salt was instead hardcoded and only 6 octets long."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4211#section-4.4"}, {"url": "https://support.keyfactor.com/hc/en-us/articles/26965687021595-EJBCA-Security-Advisory-EJBCA-standalone-CMP-CLI-client"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
