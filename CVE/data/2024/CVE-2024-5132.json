The vulnerability arises due to the lack of validation against the predefined member limits in the SEAT_ALLOWANCE constants during the invitation and joining processes. This issue enables users on any plan, including the free plan, to invite and add more members to a team than allowed, effectively circumventing the system's subscription model. The flaw is located in the backend's handling of user invitations and additions, specifically in the /api/v1/auth/index.ts and /api/v1/users.ts endpoints, where the system fails to check the current number of team members against the allowed limits before proceeding with the invitation and addition operations."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-06T19:16Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-06T19:16Z"}
