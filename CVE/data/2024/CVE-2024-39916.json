There is a security issue with the NFS configuration in /etc/exports generated by the installer that allows an attacker to modify files outside the export in the default installation. The exports have the no_subtree_check option. The no_subtree_check option means that if a client performs a file operation, the server will only check if the requested file is on the correct filesystem, not if it is in the correct directory. This enables modifying files in /images, accessing other files on the same filesystem, and accessing files on other filesystems. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.5.10.30."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-12T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-12T15:15Z"}
