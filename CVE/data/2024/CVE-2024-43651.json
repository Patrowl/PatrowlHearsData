It seems to be largely the same binary as used by the Iocharger Pedestal charging station, however. The attacker will also need a (low privilege) account to gain access to the <redacted> binary, or convince a user with such access to execute a crafted HTTP request.\n\nImpact: Critical \u2013 The attacker has full control over the charging station as the root user, and can arbitrarily add, modify and delete files and services.\n\nCVSS clarification:\u00a0Any network connection serving the web interface is vulnerable (AV:N) and there are no additional measures to circumvent (AC:L) nor does the attack require special conditions to be present (AT:N). The attack requires authentication, but the level does not matter (PR:L), nor is user interaction required (UI:N). The attack leads to a full compromised (VC:H/VI:H/VA:H) and a compromised device can be used to potentially \"pivot\" into a network that should nopt be reachable (SC:L/SI:L/SA:H). Because this is an EV charger handing significant power, there is a potential safety impact (S:P).
