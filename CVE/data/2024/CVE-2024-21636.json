Versions prior to 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the `#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and the `#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the return value of `#call`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/security/advisories/GHSA-wf2x-8w6j-qw37"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1950", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1950"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1962", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/pull/1962"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/0d26944a8d2730ea40e60eae23d70684483e5017", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/0d26944a8d2730ea40e60eae23d70684483e5017"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/c43d8bafa7117cbce479669a423ab266de150697", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component/commit/c43d8bafa7117cbce479669a423ab266de150697"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
