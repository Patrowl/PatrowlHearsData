A user with permission to view any collection using redacted hashed fields can get access the raw stored version using the `alias` functionality on the API. Normally, these redacted fields will return `**********` however  if we change the request to `?alias[workaround]=redacted` we can instead retrieve the plain text value for the field. This can be avoided by removing permission to view the sensitive fields entirely from users or roles that should not be able to see them. This vulnerability is fixed in 10.11.0."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-14T15:39Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:19Z"}
