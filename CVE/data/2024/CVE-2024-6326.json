A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by starting a back-up or restore process, which\u00a0temporarily exposes private keys, passwords, pre-shared keys, and database folders when they are temporarily copied to an interim folder. This vulnerability is due to the lack of explicit permissions set on the backup folder. If private keys are obtained by a malicious user, they could impersonate resources on the secured network."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-16T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-16T18:00Z"}
