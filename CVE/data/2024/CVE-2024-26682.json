In\nthis case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's\nactually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect\nin the middle of that."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-04-02T07:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:02Z"}
