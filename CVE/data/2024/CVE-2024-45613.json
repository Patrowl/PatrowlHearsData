Starting in version 40.0.0 and prior to version 43.1.1, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the CKEditor 5 clipboard package. This vulnerability could be triggered by a specific user action, leading to unauthorized JavaScript code execution, if the attacker managed to insert a malicious content into the editor, which might happen with a very specific editor configuration. This vulnerability only affects installations where the Block Toolbar plugin is enabled and either the General HTML Support (with a configuration that permits unsafe markup) or the HTML Embed plugin is also enabled. A fix for the problem is available in version 43.1.1. As a workaround, one may disable the block toolbar plugin."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:ckeditor:ckeditor5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "40.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "43.1.1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 2.7}}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-25T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-10-01T22:15Z"}
