The `instance_create()` D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users without authentication. This flaw allows a local non-privileged user to execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post` options that permit arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed by Tuned with root privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege escalation."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-26T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-12-05T14:15Z"}
