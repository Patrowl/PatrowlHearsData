However, an attacker will not have developer or admin rights. If the implementation of the JWT-library is wrongly configured to accept \"none\"-algorithms, the server will pass insecure JWT. A local, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-06T13:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-06T14:17Z"}
