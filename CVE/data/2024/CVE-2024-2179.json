A rogue administrator could inject malicious code into the Name field which might be executed when users visit the affected page. The Concrete CMS security team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v3.1 score of 2.2 with a vector of AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N  Concrete versions below 9 do not include group types so they are not affected by this vulnerability.
