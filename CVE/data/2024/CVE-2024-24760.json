A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:mailcow:mailcow\\:_dockerized:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "2024-01c", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.1, "impactScore": 5.2}}, "publishedDate": "2024-02-02T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:59Z"}
