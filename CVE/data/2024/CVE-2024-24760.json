A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions < 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/security/advisories/GHSA-gmpj-5xcm-xxx6"}, {"name": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/087481ac12bfa5dd715f3630f0b1697be94f7e88", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/mailcow/mailcow-dockerized/commit/087481ac12bfa5dd715f3630f0b1697be94f7e88"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-610"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
