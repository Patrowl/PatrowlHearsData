An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited network-admin functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files.\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-10-02T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-10-02T17:15Z"}
