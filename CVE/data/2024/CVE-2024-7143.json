When a role-based access control (RBAC) object in Pulp is set to assign permissions on its creation, it uses the `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` (typically the add_roles_for_object_creator method). This method finds the object creator by checking the current authenticated user. For objects that are created within a task, this current user is set by the first user with any permissions on the task object. This means the oldest user with model/domain-level task permissions will always be set as the current user of a task, even if they didn't dispatch the task. Therefore, all objects created in tasks will have their permissions assigned to this oldest user, and the creating user will receive nothing."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6765", "name": "RHSA-2024:6765", "tags": ["vendor-advisory", "x_refsource_REDHAT"]}, {"url": "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7143", "tags": ["vdb-entry", "x_refsource_REDHAT"]}, {"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2300125", "name": "RHBZ#2300125", "tags": ["issue-tracking", "x_refsource_REDHAT"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/pulp/pulpcore/blob/93f241f34c503da0fbac94bdba739feda2636e12/pulpcore/tasking/_util.py#L108"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-277"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_0": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 6.7, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "version": "3.0"}, "format": "CVSS"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
