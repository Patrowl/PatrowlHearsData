Prior to version 1.2.27, there is a file inclusion issue in the `lib/plugin.php` file. Combined with SQL injection vulnerabilities, remote code execution can be implemented. There is a file inclusion issue with the `api_plugin_hook()` function in the `lib/plugin.php` file, which reads the plugin_hooks and plugin_config tables in database. The read data is directly used to concatenate the file path which is used for file inclusion. Version 1.2.27 contains a patch for the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cx8g-hvq8-p2rv", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-cx8g-hvq8-p2rv"}, {"name": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gj3f-p326-gh8r", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-gj3f-p326-gh8r"}, {"name": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-pfh9-gwm6-86vp", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/security/advisories/GHSA-pfh9-gwm6-86vp"}, {"url": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RBEOAFKRARQHTDIYSL723XAFJ2Q6624X/"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-98"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
