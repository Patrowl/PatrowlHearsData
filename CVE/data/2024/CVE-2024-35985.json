This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returning\nfalsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.\n\nSpecifically, reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without considering\nthe limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then the\nscaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can\noverflow. This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which then\ncauses the above entity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothing\nis eligible.\n\nThus limit the range of vlag accordingly.\n\nAll this was quite rare, but fatal when it does happen."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-20T10:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-05-20T10:15Z"}
