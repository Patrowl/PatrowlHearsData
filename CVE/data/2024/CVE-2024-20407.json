Devices that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected by this vulnerability. \r\n\r This vulnerability is due to a logic error when handling embryonic (half-open) TCP connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted traffic pattern through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow unintended traffic to enter the network protected by the affected device."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-10-23T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-10-23T18:15Z"}
