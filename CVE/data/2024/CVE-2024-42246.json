This\ncauses xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing\nthe kernel to potentially freeze up.\n\nNeil suggested:\n\n  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready\n  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more\n  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.\n\nECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error\ncan be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels\nwhich do not have f10d05966196 (\"bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err\ninstead of allow boolean\"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for\nconsistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request()."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-08-07T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-08-07T19:09Z"}
