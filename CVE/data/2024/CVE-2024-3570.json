By manipulating the ChatBot responses, an attacker can inject malicious scripts to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating a new admin account or changing the user's password, leading to a complete takeover of the AnythingLLM application. The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user and ChatBot input, specifically through the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Successful exploitation requires convincing an admin to add a malicious LocalAI ChatBot to their AnythingLLM instance."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-04-10T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:29Z"}
