In affected versions `sendOverloadError` is going to assume the active request exists when `envoy.load_shed_points.http1_server_abort_dispatch` is configured. If `active_request` is nullptr, only onMessageBeginImpl() is called. However, the `onMessageBeginImpl` will directly return ok status if the stream is already reset leading to the nullptr reference. The downstream reset can actually happen during the H/2 upstream reset. As a result envoy may crash. This issue has been addressed in releases 1.32.3, 1.31.5, 1.30.9, and 1.29.12. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable `http1_server_abort_dispatch` load shed point and/or use a high threshold."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-12-18T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-12-18T22:15Z"}
