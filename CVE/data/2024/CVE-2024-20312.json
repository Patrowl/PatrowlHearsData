An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r Note: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and have formed an adjacency."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-03-27T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:52Z"}
