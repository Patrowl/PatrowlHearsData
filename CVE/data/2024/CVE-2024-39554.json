Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.\u00a0 However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.\u00a0 Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.\n\nThis issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.\n\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions of 21.1\n  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.1 before 22.1R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S3, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S2, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2.\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n  *  All versions of 21.1-EVO,\n  *  All versions of 21.2-EVO,\n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  from 22.1-EVO before 22.1R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S2-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-EVO.\n\n\n\nVersions of Junos OS before 21.1R1 are unaffected by this vulnerability.\nVersions of Junos OS Evolved before 21.1R1-EVO are unaffected by this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-10T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:27Z"}
