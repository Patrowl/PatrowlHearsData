A mitigating factor is that it requires the allow_url_include PHP runtime setting to be on, which is off in default installations. It also requires the /Upgrade route to be exposed, which is exposed by default after installing VuFind, and is recommended to be disabled by setting autoConfigure to false in config.ini."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-22T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:01Z"}
