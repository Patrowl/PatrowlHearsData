An attacker can exploit this by luring users into clicking on a Project Dashboards name that contains the malicious payload, which triggers a logout request and terminates their session. This vulnerability stems from the absence of CSRF protections on the logout functionality, allowing malicious actions to be executed without user consent."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.evms.edu/research/resources_services/redcap/redcap_change_log/"}, {"url": "https://github.com/ping-oui-no/Vulnerability-Research-CVESS/tree/main/RedCap"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
