A logical weakness during the capture of a payment in case of disabled webhooks can be exploited to create an accepted order. This could allow a threat actor to confirm an order with a fraudulent payment support. Versions 6.4.2 and 3.18.1 contain a patch for the issue. Additionally, users enable webhooks and check they are callable."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-26T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-26T15:15Z"}
