A denial of service (DoS) attack by field duplication in GraphQL is a type of attack where an attacker exploits the flexibility of GraphQL to overwhelm a server by requesting the same field multiple times in a single query. This can cause the server to perform redundant computations and consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. Request to the endpoint /graphql are sent when visualizing graphs generated at a dashboard. By modifying the data sent and duplicating many times the fields a DoS attack is possible.
