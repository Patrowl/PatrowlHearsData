Atlantis logs contains GitHub credentials (tokens `ghs_...`) when they are rotated. This enables an attacker able to read these logs to impersonate Atlantis application and to perform actions on GitHub. When Atlantis is used to administer a GitHub organization, this enables getting administration privileges on the organization. This was reported in #4060 and fixed in #4667 . The fix was included in Atlantis v0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-08T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-12T13:56Z"}
