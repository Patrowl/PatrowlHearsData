This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-2640-US routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within prog.cgi, which handles HNAP requests made to the lighttpd webserver listening on TCP ports 80 and 443. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.
