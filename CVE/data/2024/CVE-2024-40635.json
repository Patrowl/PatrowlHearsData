A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.0.4 where containers launched with a User set as a `UID:GID` larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer can cause an overflow condition where the container ultimately runs as root (UID 0). This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-265r-hfxg-fhmg", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-265r-hfxg-fhmg"}, {"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/05044ec0a9a75232cad458027ca83437aae3f4da"}, {"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1a43cb6a1035441f9aca8f5666a9b3ef9e70ab20", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/1a43cb6a1035441f9aca8f5666a9b3ef9e70ab20"}, {"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cf158e884cfe4812a6c371b59e4ea9bc4c46e51a", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cf158e884cfe4812a6c371b59e4ea9bc4c46e51a"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-190"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.6, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
