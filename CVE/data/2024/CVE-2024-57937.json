This is because\nmapping_map_writable() explicitly checks for VM_MAYWRITE, which we will\nhave cleared.\n\nCommit 5de195060b2e (\"mm: resolve faulty mmap_region() error path\nbehaviour\") unintentionally undid this logic by moving the\nmapping_map_writable() check before the shmem_mmap() hook is invoked,\nthereby regressing this change.\n\nWe reinstate this functionality by moving the check out of shmem_mmap()\nand instead performing it in do_mmap() at the point at which VMA flags are\nbeing determined, which seems in any case to be a more appropriate place\nin which to make this determination.\n\nIn order to achieve this we rework memfd seal logic to allow us access to\nthis information using existing logic and eliminate the clearing of\nVM_MAYWRITE from seal_check_write() which we are performing in do_mmap()\ninstead."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/464770df46095e6967334d77113972960f7ef1fa"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ec396d05d1b737c87311fb7311f753b02c2a6b1"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:464770df46095e6967334d77113972960f7ef1fa:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.12.*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:8ec396d05d1b737c87311fb7311f753b02c2a6b1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
