This happens because the payload-protocol match criteria is not supported in the kernel filter causing it to accept all packets without taking any other action. As a fix the payload-protocol match will be treated the same as a \"next-header\" match to avoid this filter bypass.\n\nThis issue doesn't affect IPv4 firewall filters.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and EX9200 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7;\n  *  21.1 versions earlier than 21.1R3-S5;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S5;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S4;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S4;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S2;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R1-S2, 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-12T01:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-12T01:15Z"}
