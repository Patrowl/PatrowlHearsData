Therefore:\n\n\tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nis correct, but:\n\n\tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);\n\nis not, as it makes \"host\" point not to a \"struct spi_controller\" but\nto the same \"struct cqspi_st\" structure as above.\n\nThis obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes)\ndirectly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM\nruntime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which in\nturns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.\n\nThis has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the\nexact behavior will depend on the memory contents.\n\n[0] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240226121803.5a7r5wkpbbowcxgx@dhruva/\n\nThis issue potentially affects all platforms that are currently using\nthe cadence-quadspi driver."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-04-04T09:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-20T10:15Z"}
