An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet to any IPv6 address that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the dhcp_snoop process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-08-28T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-08-28T17:15Z"}
