A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users. This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2024-001 and was discovered by the GitHub security lab."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-29T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-05-30T13:15Z"}
