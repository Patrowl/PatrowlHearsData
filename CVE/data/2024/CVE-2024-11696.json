This flaw, triggered by an invalid or unsupported extension manifest, could have caused runtime errors that disrupted the signature validation process. As a result, the enforcement of signature validation for unrelated add-ons may have been bypassed.  Signature validation in this context is used to ensure that third-party applications on the user's computer have not tampered with the user's extensions, limiting the impact of this issue. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 133, Firefox ESR < 128.5, Thunderbird < 133, and Thunderbird < 128.5."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-26T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-12-02T18:15Z"}
