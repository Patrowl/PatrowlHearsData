A use-after-free was found in Vim < 9.1.0764. When closing a buffer (visible in a window) a BufWinLeave auto command can cause an use-after-free if this auto command happens to re-open the same buffer in a new split window. Impact is low since the user must have intentionally set up such a strange auto command and run some buffer unload commands. However this may lead to a crash. This issue has been addressed in version 9.1.0764 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-rj48-v4mq-j4vg", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-rj48-v4mq-j4vg"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/51b62387be93c65fa56bbabe1c3", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/51b62387be93c65fa56bbabe1c3"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-416"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 3.9, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
