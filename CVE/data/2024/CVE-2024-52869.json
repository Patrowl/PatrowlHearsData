Specifically, when there is an operating system move from SUSE Enterprise Linux Server (SLES) 12 Service Pack (SP) 2 or 3 to SLES 15 SP2 on Teradata Database systems, some service/system user accounts, and possibly systems administrator created user accounts, are incorrectly assigned to groups that allow higher system-level privileges than intended for those user accounts. Depending on the usage of these accounts, this may lead to full system compromise."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.teradata.com/trust-security-center/data-security"}, {"url": "https://chrismanson.com/CVE/cve-2024-52869.html"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
