For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET,\n   panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear\n   VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping\n   writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha.\n   I don't think this actually has any impact in practice:\n   When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and\n   when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the\n   driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing\n   writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more*\n   flushes happen.\n\n2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are\n   mappings without the VM_SHARED flag).\n   MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has\n   copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but\n   fairly cursed.\n   In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs\n   during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range()\n   wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into\n   the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault\n   handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so\n   if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when\n   it hits a BUG() check.\n\nFix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID\ndoesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for\nthe FLUSH_ID don't make sense).\n\nReproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing\nlist; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine.\n\nNote that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't\nhave a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test it\nbefore applying it."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc5:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.12:rc6:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "6.10", "versionEndExcluding": "6.11.8", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 3.6}}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-19T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-26T22:18Z"}
