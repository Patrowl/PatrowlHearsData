This issue does not affect Solr instances that are secured via Authentication/Authorization.\n\nUsers are primarily recommended to use Authentication and Authorization when running Solr. However, upgrading to version 9.7.0, or 8.11.4 will mitigate this issue otherwise."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-10-16T08:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-10-16T16:38Z"}
