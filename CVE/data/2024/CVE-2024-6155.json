This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application that can also be leveraged to download malicious SVG files containing Cross-Site Scripting payloads to the server. On Cloud-based servers, attackers could retrieve the instance metadata. The issue was partially patched in version 8.9.9 and fully patched in version 9.0.1."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/fe3cfaf4-67c8-47af-bd58-e8ad27a03fae?source=cve"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/greenshift-animation-and-page-builder-blocks/tags/8.9.8/settings.php#L1385"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-862"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:wpsoul:greenshift \u2013 animation and page builder blocks:9.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
