This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-04-04T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:12Z"}
