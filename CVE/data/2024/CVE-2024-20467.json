An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific sizes of fragmented packets to an affected device or through a Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly (VFR)-enabled interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers and Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers if they are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 17.12.1 or 17.12.1a."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-25T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-25T17:15Z"}
