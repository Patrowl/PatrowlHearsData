The vulnerability arises from the fact that the NumberOfBytes\u00a0argument to ExAllocatePoolWithTag, and the Length argument for RtlCopyMemory, both independently dereference their value from the user supplied input buffer inside the EpdlpSetUsbAction\u00a0function, known as a double-fetch. If this length value grows to a higher value in between these two calls, it will result in the RtlCopyMemory\u00a0call copying user-supplied memory contents outside the range of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap overflow. A malicious attacker will need admin privileges to exploit the issue.\nThis issue affects Endpoint DLP version below R119."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-12-19T10:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-12-19T10:15Z"}
