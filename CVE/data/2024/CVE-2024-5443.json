The vulnerability arises from the `/mount_extension` endpoint, where a path traversal issue allows attackers to navigate beyond the intended directory structure. This is facilitated by the `data.category` and `data.folder` parameters accepting empty strings (`\"\"`), which, due to inadequate input sanitization, can lead to the construction of a `package_path` that points to the root directory. Consequently, if an attacker can create a `config.yaml` file in a controllable path, this path can be appended to the `extensions` list and trigger the execution of `__init__.py` in the current directory, leading to remote code execution. The vulnerability affects versions up to 5.9.0, and has been addressed in version 9.8."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-22T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:47Z"}
