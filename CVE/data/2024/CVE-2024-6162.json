This issue arises because the same buffer is used to decode the paths for multiple requests simultaneously, leading to incorrect path information being processed. As a result, the server may attempt to access the wrong path, causing errors such as \"404 Not Found\" or other application failures. This flaw can potentially lead to a denial of service, as legitimate resources become inaccessible due to the path mix-up."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-20T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-09T18:15Z"}
