When\nrecvmsg() is called without MSG_OOB, manage_oob() is called to check\nif the peeked skb is OOB skb.  In such a case, manage_oob() pops it\nout of the receive queue but does not clear unix_sock(sk)->oob_skb.\nThis is wrong in terms of uAPI.\n\nLet's say we send \"hello\" with MSG_OOB, and \"world\" without MSG_OOB.\nThe 'o' is handled as OOB data.  When recv() is called twice without\nMSG_OOB, the OOB data should be lost.\n\n  >>> from socket import *\n  >>> c1, c2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)\n  >>> c1.send(b'hello', MSG_OOB)  # 'o' is OOB data\n  5\n  >>> c1.send(b'world')\n  5\n  >>> c2.recv(5)  # OOB data is not received\n  b'hell'\n  >>> c2.recv(5)  # OOB date is skipped\n  b'world'\n  >>> c2.recv(5, MSG_OOB)  # This should return an error\n  b'o'\n\nIn the same situation, TCP actually returns -EINVAL for the last\nrecv().\n\nAlso, if we do not clear unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, unix_poll() always set\nEPOLLPRI even though the data has passed through by previous recv().\n\nTo avoid these issues, we must clear unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb when dequeuing\nit from recv queue.\n\nThe reason why the old GC did not trigger the deadlock is because the\nold GC relied on the receive queue to detect the loop.\n\nWhen it is triggered, the socket with OOB data is marked as GC candidate\nbecause file refcount == inflight count (1).  However, after traversing\nall inflight sockets, the socket still has a positive inflight count (1),\nthus the socket is excluded from candidates.  Then, the old GC lose the\nchance to garbage-collect the socket.\n\nWith the old GC, the repro continues to create true garbage that will\nnever be freed nor detected by kmemleak as it's linked to the global\ninflight list.  That's why we couldn't even notice the issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-20T10:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:21Z"}
