This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.\n\nThis issue affects:\n \nJuniper Networks Junos OS:\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R2.\n\n\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:\n  *  All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.3-EVO versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S8;\n  *  22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4-EVO versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R2."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-11T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:27Z"}
