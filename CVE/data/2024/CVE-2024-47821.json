The folder `/.pyload/scripts` has scripts which are run when certain actions are completed, for e.g. a download is finished. By downloading a executable file to a folder in /scripts and performing the respective action, remote code execution can be achieved in versions prior to 0.5.0b3.dev87. A file can be downloaded to such a folder by changing the download folder to a folder in `/scripts` path and using the `/flashgot` API to download the file. This vulnerability allows an attacker with access to change the settings on a pyload server to execute arbitrary code and completely compromise the system. Version 0.5.0b3.dev87 fixes this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:pyload:pyload:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-10-25T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2025-08-22T18:06Z"}
