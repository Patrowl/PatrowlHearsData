This vulnerability arises due to the use of insufficiently strong cryptographic algorithms or flawed implementation that compromises the confidentiality of password data. An attacker could exploit this weakness to decrypt or guess passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-13T12:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-13T12:15Z"}
