In an eLabFTW system, one might disallow user creation except for by system administrators, administrators and trusted services. If administrators are allowed to create new users (which is the default), the vulnerability allows any user to create new users in teams where they are members. The new users are automatically validated and administrators are not notified. This can allow a user with permanent or temporary access to a user account or API key to maintain persistence in an eLabFTW system. Additionally, it allows the user to create separate account under a different name, and produce misleading revision histories. No additional privileges are granted to the new user. Users should upgrade to version 5.0.0 to receive a patch. As a workaround, disabling both options that allow *administrators* to create users will provide a mitigation."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-08-15T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-08-15T19:15Z"}
