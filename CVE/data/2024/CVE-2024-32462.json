Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --. The vulnerability is patched in 1.15.8, 1.10.9, 1.12.9, and 1.14.6."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-phv6-cpc2-2fgj", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-phv6-cpc2-2fgj"}, {"name": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/72016e3fce8fcbeab707daf4f1a02b931fcc004d", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/72016e3fce8fcbeab707daf4f1a02b931fcc004d"}, {"name": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/81abe2a37d363f5099c3d0bdcd0caad6efc5bf97", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/81abe2a37d363f5099c3d0bdcd0caad6efc5bf97"}, {"name": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/b7c1a558e58aaeb1d007d29529bbb270dc4ff11e", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/b7c1a558e58aaeb1d007d29529bbb270dc4ff11e"}, {"name": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/bbab7ed1e672356d1a78b422462b210e8e875931", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/bbab7ed1e672356d1a78b422462b210e8e875931"}, {"url": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZFNSCFJVMAQK5AF55JBN7OSJP3CREDBD/"}, {"url": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/IB6VQAF5S2YOBULDHPUKPOEIKONOP5KO/"}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/18/5"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-88"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
