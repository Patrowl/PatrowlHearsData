The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially escalate their privileges on the system."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-18T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-18T19:25Z"}
