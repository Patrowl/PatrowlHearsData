Joplin's HTML sanitizer allows the `name` attribute to be specified. If `name` is set to the same value as an existing `document` property (e.g. `querySelector`), that property is replaced with the element. This vulnerability's only known impact is denial of service. The note viewer fails to refresh until closed and re-opened with a different note. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.8 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5cch-jr52-qffh", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-5cch-jr52-qffh"}, {"name": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/e70efcbd60ce62f06e77c183b362c74e636c02d9", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/e70efcbd60ce62f06e77c183b362c74e636c02d9"}, {"name": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_clobbering", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_clobbering"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
