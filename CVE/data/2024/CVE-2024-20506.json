An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they replace the ClamD log file with a symlink to a critical system file and then find a way to restart the ClamD process. An exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt a critical system file by appending ClamD log messages after restart."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-04T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-09-04T22:15Z"}
