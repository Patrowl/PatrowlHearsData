The implemented Flow Builder functionality in the Shopware application does not adequately validate the URL used when creating the \u201ccall webhook\u201d action. This enables malicious users to perform web requests to internal hosts. This issue has been fixed in the Commercial Plugin release 6.5.7.4 or with the Security Plugin. For installations with Shopware 6.4 the Security plugin is recommended to be installed and up to date. For older versions of 6.4 and 6.5 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.\n\n"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-3535-m8vh-vrmw", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/shopware/shopware/security/advisories/GHSA-3535-m8vh-vrmw"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-918"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
