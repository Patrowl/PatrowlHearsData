In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/security/advisories/GHSA-hxr6-w4gc-7vvv"}, {"name": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/commit/4022c12f314bd89d127d1be008b1a80a08e1203d"}, {"url": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T7DKVEVREYAI4F46CQAVOTPL75WLOZOE/"}, {"url": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00004.html"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-400"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
