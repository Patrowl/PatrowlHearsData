Quickshare normally deletes unkown files, however an attacker can send two Payload transfer frames of type FILE and the same payload ID. The deletion logic will only delete the first file and not the second. We recommend upgrading past commit\u00a05d8b9156e0c339d82d3dab0849187e8819ad92c0 or\u00a0Quick Share Windows v1.0.2002.2"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-07T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-08T19:01Z"}
