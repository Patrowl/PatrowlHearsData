This disclosure could then lead to additional brute-force password-guessing attacks. This vulnerability would require that the Splunk platform instance uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication scheme."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-01T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-02T12:09Z"}
