There is a possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability  in the `content_security_policy` helper starting in version 5.2.0 of Action Pack and prior to versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1. Applications which set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) headers dynamically from untrusted user input may be vulnerable to carefully crafted inputs being able to inject new directives into the CSP. This could lead to a bypass of the CSP and its protection against XSS and other attacks. Versions 7.0.8.7, 7.1.5.1, 7.2.2.1, and 8.0.0.1 contain a fix. As a workaround, applications can avoid setting CSP headers dynamically from untrusted input, or can validate/sanitize that input."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-vfm5-rmrh-j26v", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/security/advisories/GHSA-vfm5-rmrh-j26v"}, {"name": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2e3f41e4538b9ca1044357f6644f037bbb7c6c49", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2e3f41e4538b9ca1044357f6644f037bbb7c6c49"}, {"name": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3da2479cfe1e00177114b17e496213c40d286b3a", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/3da2479cfe1e00177114b17e496213c40d286b3a"}, {"name": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5558e72f22fc69c1c407b31ac5fb3b4ce087b542", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/5558e72f22fc69c1c407b31ac5fb3b4ce087b542"}, {"name": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/cb16a3bb515b5d769f73926d9757270ace691f1d", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/cb16a3bb515b5d769f73926d9757270ace691f1d"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "PASSIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "LOW", "subIntegrityImpact": "LOW", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 2.3, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
