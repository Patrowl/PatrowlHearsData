When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-03T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-03T15:15Z"}
