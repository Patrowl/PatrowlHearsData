This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and read the `history` files of other users, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is present in the application's handling of access control for the `history` path, where no adequate mechanism is in place to prevent an authenticated user from accessing another user's chat history files. This issue poses a significant risk as it could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information from the chat history of other users."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-06-06T19:16Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-06-07T14:56Z"}
