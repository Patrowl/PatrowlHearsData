In versions 1.2.0 through 2.1.1, an authenticated command injection vulnerability in the WAF detection tool allows an authenticated attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands as root user. The URL query parameter `url` is passed to `subprocess.check_output` without any sanitization, resulting in a command injection vulnerability. This API endpoint is accessible by authenticated users with any use role. Because the process runs as `root`, an attacker has root access. Commit edd3c85ee16f93804ad38dac5602549d2d30a93e contains a patch for the issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-23T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-24T12:55Z"}
