This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires \"maintenance mode\" for a targeted form to be enabled. However, there is no setting available to the attacker or even an administrator-level user to enable this mode. The mode is only enabled during a required update, which is a very short window of time. Additionally, because of the self-based nature of this vulnerability, attackers would have to rely on additional techniques to execute a supplied payload in the context of targeted user."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:ninjaforms:ninja_forms:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "3.8.16", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 2.7}}, "publishedDate": "2024-09-25T07:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-10-02T18:26Z"}
