Versions prior to 1.1.21 a cross-site websocket hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability within the control.ashx endpoint. This component is the primary mechanism used within MeshCentral to perform administrative actions on the server. The vulnerability is exploitable when an attacker is able to convince a victim end-user to click on a malicious link to a page hosting an attacker-controlled site. The attacker can then originate a cross-site websocket connection using client-side JavaScript code to connect to `control.ashx` as the victim user within MeshCentral. Version 1.1.21 contains a patch for this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-02-20T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T09:02Z"}
