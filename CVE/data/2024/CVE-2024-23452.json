Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0\n 2. Apply this patch:\u00a0 https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2518 \n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-02-08T09:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-02-08T09:15Z"}
