If `EmptyTensorList` receives an input `element_shape` with more than one dimension, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c8ba76d48567aed347508e0552a257641931024d. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-09-16T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-09-17T01:55Z"}
