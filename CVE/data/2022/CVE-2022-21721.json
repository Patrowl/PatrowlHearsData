Starting with version 12.0.0 and prior to version 12.0.9, vulnerable code could allow a bad actor to trigger a denial of service attack for anyone using i18n functionality. In order to be affected by this CVE, one must use next start or a custom server and the built-in i18n support. Deployments on Vercel, along with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released, `next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:vercel:next.js:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "12.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "12.0.9", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.6}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "MEDIUM", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "PARTIAL", "baseScore": 4.3}, "severity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 8.6, "impactScore": 2.9, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2022-01-28T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:45Z"}
