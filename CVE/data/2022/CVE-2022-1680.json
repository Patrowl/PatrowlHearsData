When group SAML SSO is configured, the SCIM feature (available only on Premium+ subscriptions) may allow any owner of a Premium group to invite arbitrary users through their username and email, then change those users' email addresses via SCIM to an attacker controlled email address and thus - in the absence of 2FA - take over those accounts. It is also possible for the attacker to change the display name and username of the targeted account."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-06-06T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-06-06T18:27Z"}
