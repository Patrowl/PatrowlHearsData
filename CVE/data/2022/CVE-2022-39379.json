A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in non-default configurations of Fluentd allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted JSON payloads. Fluentd setups are only affected if the environment variable `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE` is explicitly set to `object`. Please note: The option FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE was introduced in Fluentd version 1.13.2. Earlier versions of Fluentd are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue was patched in version 1.15.3. As a workaround do not use `FLUENT_OJ_OPTION_MODE=object`."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-11-02T13:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-11-02T13:15Z"}
