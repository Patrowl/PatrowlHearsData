Using a modified USB device an attacker can leak stack addresses of the `razer_attr_read_dpi_stages`, potentially bypassing KASLR. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to access to a users keyboard or mouse or would need to convince a user to use a modified device. The issue has been patched in v3.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade and should be reminded not to plug in unknown USB devices."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-12-05T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-12-05T20:27Z"}
