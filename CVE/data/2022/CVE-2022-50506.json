When we don't have an ldev (i.e. when\nthe DRBD device is diskless), this leads to a null pointer deref.\n\nSo, only allocate the private_bio if we actually have a disk. This is\nalso a small optimization, since we don't clone the bio to only to\nimmediately free it again in the diskless case."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/05580a3bbf3cec677cb00a85dfeb21d6a9b48eaf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d42ddf7f27b6723549ee6d4c8b1b418b59bf6b5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
