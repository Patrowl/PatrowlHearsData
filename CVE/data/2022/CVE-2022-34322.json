The attacker needs to be authenticated to reach the vulnerable features. An issue is present in the Notify Users About Modification menu and the Notifications feature. A user can send malicious notifications and execute JavaScript code in the browser of every user who has enabled notifications. This is a stored XSS, and can lead to privilege escalation in the context of the application. (Another issue is present in the Favorites tab. The name of a favorite or a folder of favorites is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code, which is executed when displayed. This is a self-XSS.)"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:sage:sage_enterprise_intelligence:2021_r1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.3, "impactScore": 6.0}}, "publishedDate": "2023-01-01T08:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T07:09Z"}
