An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a man-in-the-middle technique to intercept the traffic between the devices, and then using a self-signed certificate to impersonate the endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the intercepted traffic in clear text or alter the contents of the traffic.\r\nNote: Cisco&nbsp;Expressway-E is not affected by this vulnerability.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.4, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 5.2}}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-15T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-15T22:15Z"}
