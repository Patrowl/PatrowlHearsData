When `Conv2DBackpropInput` receives empty `out_backprop` inputs (e.g. `[3, 1, 0, 1]`), the current CPU/GPU kernels `CHECK` fail (one with dnnl, the other with cudnn). This can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 27a65a43cf763897fecfa5cdb5cc653fc5dd0346. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds for this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-09-16T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-09-16T23:15Z"}
