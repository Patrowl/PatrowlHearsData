This makes it possible with attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to supply paths to arbitrary files on the server that will subsequently be deleted. This can be used to delete the wp-config.php file that can allow an attacker to configure the site and achieve remote code execution."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-11-29T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-11-29T21:22Z"}
