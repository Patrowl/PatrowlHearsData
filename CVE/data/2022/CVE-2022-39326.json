Prior to version 2.7.5, all users of the `run-terraform` reusable workflow from the kartverket/github-workflows repo are affected by a code injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could potentially send a PR with a malicious payload leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the workflow. Users should upgrade to at least version 2.7.5 to resolve the issue. As a workaround, review any pull requests from external users for malicious payloads before allowing them to trigger a build."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-10-25T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-10-25T17:37Z"}
