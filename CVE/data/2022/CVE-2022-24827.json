When leveraging the following together: Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries, Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter), and a parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided in Elide 6.1.4. The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-04-11T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-04-11T21:15Z"}
