This works because there are\nno cases where an operation needs a large RPC Call message and a\nlarge RPC Reply at the same time.\n\nOnce an RPC Call has been received, svc_process() updates\nsvc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can be\nused for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer\n(rq_res) shrinks when the received RPC record containing the RPC\nCall is large.\n\nA client can force this shrinkage on TCP by sending a correctly-\nformed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is\nexcessively large. The full maximum payload size cannot be\nconstructed in that case."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1868332032eccbab8c1878a0d918193058c0a905", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2007867c5874134f2271eb276398208070049dd3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2be9331ca6061bc6ea32247266f45b8b21030244", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/401bc1f90874280a80b93f23be33a0e7e2d1f912", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea4c3eee0fd72fcedaa238556044825639cd3607", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
