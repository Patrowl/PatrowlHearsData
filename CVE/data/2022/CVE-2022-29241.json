Prior to version 1.17.1, if notebook server is started with a value of `root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then the underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server. While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:jupyter:jupyter_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "1.17.0", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "SINGLE", "confidentialityImpact": "COMPLETE", "integrityImpact": "COMPLETE", "availabilityImpact": "COMPLETE", "baseScore": 9.0}, "severity": "HIGH", "exploitabilityScore": 8.0, "impactScore": 10.0, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2022-06-14T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:58Z"}
