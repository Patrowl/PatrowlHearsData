When rendering validation error messages via the `formElementErrors()` view helper shipped with laminas-form, many messages will contain the submitted value. However, in laminas-form prior to version 3.1.1, the value was not being escaped for HTML contexts, which could potentially lead to a reflected cross-site scripting attack. Versions 3.1.1 and above contain a patch to mitigate the vulnerability. A workaround is available. One may manually place code at the top of a view script where one calls the `formElementErrors()` view helper. More information about this workaround is available on the GitHub Security Advisory."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-01-28T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-01-28T23:15Z"}
