A vulnerable back-end can potentially be exploited by declaring multiple Content-Type \"charset\" names and therefore bypassing the configurable CRS Content-Type header \"charset\" allow list. An encoded payload can bypass CRS detection this way and may then be decoded by the backend. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-09-20T07:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-09-20T07:15Z"}
