All Podium layouts that include podlets with proxy endpoints are affected. `@podium/layout`, which is the main way developers/users are vulnerable to this exploit, has been patched in version `4.6.110`. All earlier versions are vulnerable.`@podium/proxy`, which is the source of the vulnerability and is used by `@podium/layout` has been patched in version `4.2.74`.
