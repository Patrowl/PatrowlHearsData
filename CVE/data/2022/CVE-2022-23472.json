Versions prior to 1.0.5 rely on the python `random` library for random value selection. The python `random` library warns that it should not be used for security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-12-06T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-12-06T19:23Z"}
