Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfrom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5.
