Hence the crash.\n\nA reproducer is:\n\n    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vdb\n    debugfs -w /dev/vdb -R \"set_inode_field <8> flags 0x80808\"\n    mount /dev/vdb /mnt -o inlinecrypt\n\nTo fix this, make ext4 consider journal inodes with the encrypt flag to\nbe invalid.  (Note, maybe other flags should be rejected on the journal\ninode too.  For now, this is just the minimal fix for the above issue.)\n\nI've marked this as fixing the commit that introduced the call to\nfscrypt_limit_io_blocks(), since that's what made an actual crash start\nbeing possible.  But this fix could be applied to any version of ext4\nthat supports the encrypt feature."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/105c78e12468413e426625831faa7db4284e1fec", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f7a6626f611aa06d7907aa45b484708dd5ac8bc", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bcc5057e1781a3ee889225480d995c3b5cbde555", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
