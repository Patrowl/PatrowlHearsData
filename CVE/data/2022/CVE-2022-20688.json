This vulnerability is due to missing length validation of certain Cisco Discovery Protocol packet header fields. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device and cause Cisco Discovery Protocol to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-12-12T09:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-12-12T11:26Z"}
