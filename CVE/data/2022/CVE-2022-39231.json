In versions prior to 4.10.16, or from 5.0.0 to 5.2.6, validation of the authentication adapter app ID for _Facebook_ and _Spotify_ may be circumvented. Configurations which allow users to authenticate using the Parse Server authentication adapter where `appIds` is set as a string instead of an array of strings authenticate requests from an app with a different app ID than the one specified in the `appIds` configuration. For this vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker needs to be assigned an app ID by the authentication provider which is a sub-set of the server-side configured app ID. This issue is patched in versions 4.10.16 and 5.2.7. There are no known workarounds."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-09-23T08:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-09-23T08:15Z"}
