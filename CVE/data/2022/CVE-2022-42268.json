These applications allow executable Python code to be embedded in Universal Scene Description (USD) files to customize all aspects of a scene. If a user opens a USD file that contains embedded Python code in one of these applications, the embedded Python code automatically runs with the privileges of the user who opened the file. As a result, an unprivileged remote attacker could craft a USD file containing malicious Python code and persuade a local user to open the file, which may lead to information disclosure, data tampering, and denial of service."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-01-13T06:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-01-13T14:01Z"}
