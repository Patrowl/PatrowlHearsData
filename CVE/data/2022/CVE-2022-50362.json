Each thread rewrite channels's descriptor as soon as\ndevice_issue_pending is called. It leads to the situation that\nthe driver thinks that it uses the right descriptor in interrupt\nhandler while channels's descriptor has been changed by other\nthread. The descriptor which in fact reported interrupt will not\nbe handled any more, as well as its tx->callback.\nThat's why timeout reports.\n\nWith current fixes channels' descriptor changes it's value only\nwhen it has been used. A new descriptor is acquired from\nvc->desc_issued queue that is already filled with descriptors\nthat are ready to be sent. Threads have no direct access to DMA\nchannel descriptor. In case of channel's descriptor is busy, try\nto submit to HW again when a descriptor is completed. In this case,\nvc->desc_issued may be empty when hisi_dma_start_transfer is called,\nso delete error reporting on this. Now it is just possible to queue\na descriptor for further processing."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2cbb95883c990d0002a77e13d3278913ab26ad79", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7cb9b20941e1fb20d22d0a2f460a3d4fa417274c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/af12e209a9d559394d35875ba0e6c80407605888", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4a8ec5cc7ff5d442bd49a44f26d74b2021ba4c8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f4cee0b385cd0348e071d4d80c4c13cfe547c70d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
