The code uses\nput_unused_fd() for the former which is wrong, as the file descriptor\nwas already published by fd_install() which gets called internally by\nanon_inode_getfd().\n\nThis makes the error handling code leaving a half cleaned up file\ndescriptor table around and a partially destructed 'file' object,\nallowing userland to play use-after-free tricks on us, by abusing\nthe still usable fd and making the code operate on a dangling\n'file->private_data' pointer.\n\nInstead of leaving the kernel in a partially corrupted state, don't\nattempt to explicitly clean up and leave this to the process exit\npath that'll release any still valid fds, including the one created\nby the previous call to anon_inode_getfd().
