When a BGP session flap happens, a Use After Free of a memory location that was assigned to another object can occur, which will lead to an rpd crash. This is a race condition that is outside of the attacker's control and cannot be deterministically exploited. Continued flapping of BGP sessions can create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
