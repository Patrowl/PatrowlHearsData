When `mlir::tfg::ConvertGenericFunctionToFunctionDef` is given empty function attributes, it gives a null dereference. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit aed36912609fc07229b4d0a7b44f3f48efc00fd0. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
