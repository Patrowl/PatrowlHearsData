These vulnerabilities are due to improper management of system resources when the Snort detection engine is processing SMB2 traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a high rate of certain types of SMB2 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: When the snort preserve-connection option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, a successful exploit could also allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. The snort preserve-connection setting is enabled by default. See the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory for more information. Note: Only products that have Snort 3 configured are affected. Products that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-11-15T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-11-15T21:56Z"}
