IV generation is based upon several TDMA frame counters, which are frequently broadcast by the infrastructure in an unauthenticated manner. An active adversary can manipulate the view of these counters in a mobile station, provoking keystream re-use. By sending crafted messages to the MS and analyzing MS responses, keystream for arbitrary frames can be recovered."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-10-19T10:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-10-19T10:15Z"}
