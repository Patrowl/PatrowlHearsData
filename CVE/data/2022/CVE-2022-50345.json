This works because there are\nno cases where an operation needs a large RPC Call message and a\nlarge RPC Reply at the same time.\n\nOnce an RPC Call has been received, svc_process() updates\nsvc_rqst::rq_res to describe the part of rq_pages that can be\nused for constructing the Reply. This means that the send buffer\n(rq_res) shrinks when the received RPC record containing the RPC\nCall is large.\n\nA client can force this shrinkage on TCP by sending a correctly-\nformed RPC Call header contained in an RPC record that is\nexcessively large. The full maximum payload size cannot be\nconstructed in that case."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/309f29361b6bfae96936317376f1114568c5de19", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/75d9de25a6f833dd0701ca546ac926cabff2b5af", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc6c0ed253cd4763dba7541d558e4b704f33176f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c23687911f82a63fa2977ce9c992b395e90f8ba0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa6be9cc6e80ec79892ddf08a8c10cabab9baf38", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
