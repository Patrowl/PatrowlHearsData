A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static` parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context (via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be done. Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call came from a direct `STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call context is entered, it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that actually uses `is_static`. For those affected, the issue can lead to possible incorrect state transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch. There are no known workarounds."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-10-25T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-10-25T19:36Z"}
