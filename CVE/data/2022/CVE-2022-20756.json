This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access. Note: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) is required. See the Details section for more information."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-04-06T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-04-06T19:22Z"}
