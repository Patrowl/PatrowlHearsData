Wire is vulnerable to arbitrary HTML and Javascript execution via insufficient escaping when rendering `@mentions` in the wire-webapp. If a user receives and views a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim allowing the attacker to fully control the user account. Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack. The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp 2022-05-04-production.0 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-05-04-production.0-v0.29.7-0-a6f2ded or wire-server 2022-05-04 (chart/4.11.0) or later.
