However when the credentials are different, the local account credentials are inadvertently sent to the GlobalProtect portal for authentication. A third party MITM type of attacker cannot see these credentials in transit.\n\nThis vulnerability is a concern where the GlobalProtect app is deployed on Bring-your-Own-Device (BYOD) type of clients with private local user accounts or GlobalProtect app is used to connect to different organizations.\n\nFixed versions of GlobalProtect app have an app setting to prevent the transmission of the user's local user credentials to the target GlobalProtect portal regardless of the portal configuration.\nThis issue impacts:\nGlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.1.10 on Windows and MacOS;\nGlobalProtect app 5.2 versions earlier than GlobalProtect app 5.2.9 on Windows and MacOS\n\nThis issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-02-10T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-02-10T18:15Z"}
