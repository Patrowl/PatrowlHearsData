It can also be 0, if there\nis no owner of the other page half, and xdp_do_redirect() for this\nbuffer ran so far that it triggered a flush of the devmap/cpumap bulk\nqueue, and the consumers of those bulk queues also freed the buffer,\nall by the time xdp_do_redirect() returns the execution back to enetc.\n\nThis is the reason why enetc_flip_rx_buff() is called before\nxdp_do_redirect(), but there is a big flaw with that reasoning:\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() will set rx_swbd->page = NULL on both sides of the\nenetc_page_reusable() branch, and if xdp_do_redirect() returns an error,\nwe call enetc_xdp_free(), which does not deal gracefully with that.\n\nIn fact, what happens is quite special. The page refcounts start as 1.\nenetc_flip_rx_buff() figures they're reusable, transfers these\nrx_swbd->page pointers to a different rx_swbd in enetc_reuse_page(), and\nbumps the refcount to 2. When xdp_do_redirect() later returns an error,\nwe call the no-op enetc_xdp_free(), but we still haven't lost the\nreference to that page. A copy of it is still at rx_ring->next_to_alloc,\nbut that has refcount 2 (and there are no concurrent owners of it in\nflight, to drop the refcount). What really kills the system is when\nwe'll flip the rx_swbd->page the second time around. With an updated\nrefcount of 2, the page will not be reusable and we'll really leak it.\nThen enetc_new_page() will have to allocate more pages, which will then\neventually leak again on further errors from xdp_do_redirect().\n\nThe problem, summarized, is that we zeroize rx_swbd->page before we're\ncompletely done with it, and this makes it impossible for the error path\nto do something with it.\n\nSince the packet is potentially multi-buffer and therefore the\nrx_swbd->page is potentially an array, manual passing of the old\npointers between enetc_flip_rx_buff() and enetc_xdp_free() is a bit\ndifficult.\n\nFor the sake of going with a simple solution, we accept the possibility\nof racing with xdp_do_redirect(), and we move the flip procedure to\nexecute only on the redirect success path. By racing, I mean that the\npage may be deemed as not reusable by enetc (having a refcount of 0),\nbut there will be no leak in that case, either.\n\nOnce we accept that, we have something better to do with buffers on\nXDP_REDIRECT failure. Since we haven't performed half-page flipping yet,\nwe won't, either (and this way, we can avoid enetc_xdp_free()\ncompletely, which gives the entire page to the slab allocator).\nInstead, we'll call enetc_xdp_drop(), which will recycle this half of\nthe buffer back to the RX ring."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/306526331e7a37e714e11ab7c6d73eb004745224", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/628050ec952d2e2e46ec9fb6aa07e41139e030c8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7fba523b51ccce5f7981f8a43ad84d664da68131", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bcf2c1dc5358dcf7e34a68cdb6b0bbf967801efa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "7520696A-9404-4EF7-BE25-AE79EAFA5337", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "5.13", "versionEndExcluding": "5.15.86"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "C720A569-3D93-4D77-95F6-E2B3A3267D9F", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "5.16", "versionEndExcluding": "6.0.16"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "77239F4B-6BB2-4B9E-A654-36A52396116C", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "6.1", "versionEndExcluding": "6.1.2"}]}]}}
