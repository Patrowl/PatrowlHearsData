So David suggests this patch by draining\nin-progress ->queue_rq() for solving this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7a73c54a3750895888ab586896736c9434e062a1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/82c229476b8f6afd7e09bc4dc77d89dc19ff7688", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b3d6b029a552d2978bbac275303d11419826a69", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
