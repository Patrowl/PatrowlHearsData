The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters for certain API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input to an affected API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with low system privileges. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user with Device permissions: by default, only Administrators, Security Approvers and Network Admins user accounts have these permissions."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-11-15T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-11-15T21:56Z"}
