When `Unbatch` receives a nonscalar input `id`, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 4419d10d576adefa36b0e0a9425d2569f7c0189f. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0.

There are no known workarounds for this issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-09-16T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-09-17T01:55Z"}
