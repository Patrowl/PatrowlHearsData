This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-04-15T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-04-15T15:22Z"}
