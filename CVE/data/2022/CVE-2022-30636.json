On Windows, path.Base acts differently to filepath.Base, since Windows uses a different path separator (\\ vs. /), allowing a user to provide a relative path, i.e. .well-known/acme-challenge/..\\..\\asd becomes ..\\..\\asd. The extracted path is then suffixed with +http-01, joined with the cache directory, and opened. Since the controlled path is suffixed with +http-01 before opening, the impact of this is significantly limited, since it only allows reading arbitrary files on the system if and only if they have this suffix."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-07-02T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-07-03T12:53Z"}
