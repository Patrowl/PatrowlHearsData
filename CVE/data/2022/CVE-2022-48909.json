Therefore, it is impossible for the to be\ndisconnected at all.\n\nThis patch tries a very simple way to avoid this issue, once the state\nhas changed to SMC_ACTIVE after tcp_abort(), we can actively abort the\nsmc connection, considering that the state is SMC_INIT before\ntcp_abort(), abandoning the complete disconnection process should not\ncause too much problem.\n\nIn fact, this problem may exist as long as the CLC CONFIRM message is\nnot received by the server. Whether a timer should be added after\nsmc_close_final() needs to be discussed in the future. But even so, this\npatch provides a faster release for connection in above case, it should\nalso be valuable."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-08-22T02:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-08-22T12:48Z"}
