The\n_rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() is used to compare the first n bytes of the two\nstrings from tail to head, which causes the problem. In the\n_rtl8812ae_phy_set_txpower_limit(), it was originally intended to meet\nthis requirement by carefully designing the comparison order.\nFor example, \"pregulation\" and \"pbandwidth\" are compared in order of\nlength from small to large, first is 3 and last is 4. However, the\ncomparison order of \"prate_section\" dose not obey such order requirement,\ntherefore when \"prate_section\" is \"HT\", when comparing from tail to head,\nit will lead to access out of bounds in _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte(). As\nmentioned above, the _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() has the same function as\nstrcmp(), so just strcmp() is enough.\n\nFix it by removing _rtl8812ae_eq_n_byte() and use strcmp() barely.\nAlthough it can be fixed by adjusting the comparison order of\n\"prate_section\", this may cause the value of \"rate_section\" to not be\nfrom 0 to 5. In addition, commit \"21e4b0726dc6\" not only moved driver\nfrom staging to regular tree, but also added setting txpower limit\nfunction during the driver config phase, so the problem was introduced\nby this commit."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/057b52461dc005ecd85a3e4998913b1492ec0f72", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c962dcd6bf64b78eaffc09e497a2beb4e48bc32", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/117dbeda22ec5ea0918254d03b540ef8b8a64d53", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1e950b9a841bc96e98ee25680d5c7aa305120be1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/28ea268d95e57cdf6394a058f0d854206d478772", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f1fe40120de6ad4ffa8299fde035a5feba10d4fb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fc3442247716fc426bbcf62ed65e086e48a6d44f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
