As such, any calls\nby these routines to free skb's, should use the\ninterrupt context safe dev_kfree_skb_any() function.\n\nPreviously, these callback handlers would call the\ninterrupt unsafe version of dev_kfree_skb(). This has\nnot presented an issue on Intel IOAT DMA engines as\nthat driver utilizes tasklets rather than a hard\ninterrupt handler, like the AMD PTDMA DMA driver.\nOn AMD systems, a kernel WARNING message is\nencountered, which is being issued from\nskb_release_head_state() due to in_hardirq()\nbeing true.\n\nBesides the user visible WARNING from the kernel,\nthe other symptom of this bug was that TCP/IP performance\nacross the ntb_netdev interface was very poor, i.e.\napproximately an order of magnitude below what was\nexpected. With the repair to use dev_kfree_skb_any(),\nkernel WARNINGs from skb_release_head_state() ceased\nand TCP/IP performance, as measured by iperf, was on\npar with expected results, approximately 20 Gb/s on\nAMD Milan based server. Note that this performance\nis comparable with Intel based servers."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07e28a8f450217db679802ebd4de0915556ce846", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/13286ad1c7c49c606fdcba4cf66f953a1a16c1ca", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14d245da57a11e80277ab455aa9b6dcc5ed38a19", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/21296a52caa6a6bad6debdfe40ad81d4f1a27e69", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f7d78b2b12a9d561f48fa00bab29b40f4616dad", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b78493968ed3cef0326183ed059c55e42f24d5b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a6b9e09403102bdf8402dae734800e4916c7ea58", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4460c82177899751975180c268f352893302221", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd860b39aa7c7b82e6c99b6fdb99d4610ce49d67", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
