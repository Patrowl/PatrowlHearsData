An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an XMPP messaging server and sending crafted XMPP messages to an affected Jabber client. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to manipulate the content of XMPP messages, possibly allowing the attacker to cause the Jabber client application to perform unsafe actions."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-09-15T03:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-09-15T12:51Z"}
