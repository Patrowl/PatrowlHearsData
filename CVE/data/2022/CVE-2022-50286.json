If not, the block is delayed\nallocated, and otherwise, it isn't.  However, if the inline option is\nalso used, and if the file containing the block is marked as able to\nstore data inline, there isn't a valid extent tree associated with\nthe file.  The current code in ext4_clu_mapped() calls\next4_find_extent() to search the non-existent tree for a previously\nallocated cluster anyway, which typically finds nothing, as desired.\nHowever, a side effect of the search can be to cache invalid content\nfrom the non-existent tree (garbage) in the extent status tree,\nincluding bogus entries in the pending reservation tree.\n\nTo fix this, avoid searching the extent tree when allocating blocks\nfor bigalloc + inline files that are being converted from inline to\nextent mapped."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/131294c35ed6f777bd4e79d42af13b5c41bf2775", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6f4200ec76a0d31200c308ec5a71c68df5417004", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/81b915181c630ee1cffa052e52874fe4e1ba91ac", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9404839e0c9db5a517ea83c0ca3388b39d105fdf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0c8edbc8abbe8f16d80a1d794d1ba2c12b6f193", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d440d6427a5e3a877c1c259b8d2b216ddb65e185", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
