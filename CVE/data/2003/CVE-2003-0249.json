NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying \"It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:php:php:4.4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "PARTIAL", "integrityImpact": "PARTIAL", "availabilityImpact": "PARTIAL", "baseScore": 7.5}, "severity": "HIGH", "exploitabilityScore": 10.0, "impactScore": 6.4, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": true, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2003-12-31T05:00Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-05-17T00:20Z"}
