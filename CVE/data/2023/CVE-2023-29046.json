Some connections use user-controlled endpoints, which could be malicious and attempt to keep the connection open for an extended period of time. As a result users were able to trigger large amount of egress network connections, possibly exhausting network pool resources and lock up legitimate requests. A new mechanism has been introduced to cancel external connections that might access user-controlled endpoints. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-11-02T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-11-02T14:26Z"}
