So it's unlikely that an admin would deliberately sabotage their \nown server. Still, a situation can happen where an admin not \nknowledgeable about JavaScript could be tricked by an attacker into \nwriting the malicious JavaScript code into some config files.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Convict: before 6.2.4."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-11-26T12:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-27T16:15Z"}
