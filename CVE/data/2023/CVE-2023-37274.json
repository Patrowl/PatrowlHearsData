When Auto-GPT is executed directly on the host system via the provided run.sh or run.bat files, custom Python code execution is sandboxed using a temporary dedicated docker container which should not have access to any files outside of the Auto-GPT workspace directory.\nBefore v0.4.3, the `execute_python_code` command (introduced in v0.4.1) does not sanitize the `basename` arg before writing LLM-supplied code to a file with an LLM-supplied name. This allows for a path traversal attack that can overwrite any .py file outside the workspace directory by specifying a `basename` such as `../../../main.py`. This can further be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution on the host running Auto-GPT by e.g. overwriting autogpt/main.py which will be executed outside of the docker environment meant to sandbox custom python code execution the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3. As a workaround, the risk introduced by this vulnerability can be remediated by running Auto-GPT in a virtual machine, or another environment in which damage to files or corruption of the program is not a critical problem."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4756", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-5h38-mgp9-rj5f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4756", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-5h38-mgp9-rj5f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-94"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:agpt:auto-gpt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "10E8D9E9-E73C-4B20-989E-1D432F7ED3BB", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "0.4.3"}]}]}}
