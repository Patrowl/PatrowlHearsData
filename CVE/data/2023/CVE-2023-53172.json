This happens if FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY is called\non a fd opened with access mode 3, which means \"ioctl access only\".\n\nArguably, FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY should work on ioctl-only fds.  But\nioctl-only fds are a weird Linux extension that is rarely used and that\nfew people even know about.  (The documentation for FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY\neven specifically says it requires O_RDONLY.)  It's probably not\nworthwhile to make the ioctl internally open a new fd just to handle\nthis case.  Thus, just reject the ioctl on such fds for now."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04839139213cf60d4c5fc792214a08830e294ff8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/85c039cff3c359967cafe90443c02321e950b216", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
