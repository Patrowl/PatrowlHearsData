Prior to versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1, under specific conditions, Cilium may misattribute the source IP address of traffic to a cluster, identifying external traffic as coming from the host on which Cilium is running. As a consequence, network policies for that cluster might be bypassed, depending on the specific network policies enabled.\n\nThis issue only manifests when Cilium is routing IPv6 traffic and NodePorts are used to route traffic to pods. IPv6 and endpoint routes are both disabled by default.\n\nThe problem has been fixed and is available on versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1. As a workaround, disable IPv6 routing."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "1.11.15", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "1.13.0", "versionEndExcluding": "1.13.1", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:cilium:cilium:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "1.12.0", "versionEndExcluding": "1.12.8", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.4}}, "publishedDate": "2023-03-17T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T07:53Z"}
