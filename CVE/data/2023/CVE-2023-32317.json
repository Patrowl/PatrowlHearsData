A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both \"Base File Tar\" and \"Additional file archive\" can be fed with Tar files that contain paths outside their target directories (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`). When the MOSS cheat checker is started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within the scope of the running process.  This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-26T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-26T23:15Z"}
