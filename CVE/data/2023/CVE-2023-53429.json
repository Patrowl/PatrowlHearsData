But if that end I/O handler sets the PageError bit,\nand the submitter checks it, the bit could in some cases leak into the\nsubmission context for fast enough I/O.\n\nFix this by simply not checking PageError and just using the local\nret variable to check for submission errors.  This also fundamentally\nsolves the long problem documented in a comment in __extent_writepage\nby never leaking the error bit into the submission context."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e92499e3b004baffb479d61e191b41b604ece9a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d40be032ecd8ee1ca033bee43c7755d21fb4d72a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
