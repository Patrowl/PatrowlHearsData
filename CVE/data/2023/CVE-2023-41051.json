The vm-memory rust crate provides a set of traits to decouple VM memory consumers from VM memory providers. An issue was discovered in the default implementations of the `VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut, get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a `VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function\u2019s `count` argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory` are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s documentation. The issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the `VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-09-01T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-09-01T21:15Z"}
