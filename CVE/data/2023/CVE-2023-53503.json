However, if a\nmalicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block\ndevice while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for\ns_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,\nwhen calculating the block group of some block number (such as the\nstarting block of a preallocation region), could result in an\nunderflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in\next4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service\nattack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to\nthe block device.\n\nFor a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if\nthe system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it\nwill not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()\nwill call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in\nall of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.\n\nAlso, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an\ninline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the\ncompiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/100c0ad6c04597fefeaaba2bb1827cc015d95067", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31668cebf45adfb6283e465e641c4f5a21b07afa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5354b2af34064a4579be8bc0e2f15a7b70f14b5f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/620a3c28221bb219b81bc0bffd065cc187494302", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4319e457d6e3fb33e443efeaf4634fc36e8a9ed", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
