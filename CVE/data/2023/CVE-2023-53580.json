The panic\ninvolves a somewhat complicated interaction between the kernel driver\nand a userspace component (as described in the Link tag below), but\nthe analysis did make one thing clear: The Gadget core should\naccomodate gadget drivers calling usb_gadget_deactivate() as part of\ntheir unbind procedure.\n\nCurrently this doesn't work.  gadget_unbind_driver() calls\ndriver->unbind() while holding the udc->connect_lock mutex, and\nusb_gadget_deactivate() attempts to acquire that mutex, which will\nresult in a deadlock.\n\nThe simple fix is for gadget_unbind_driver() to release the mutex when\ninvoking the ->unbind() callback.  There is no particular reason for\nit to be holding the mutex at that time, and the mutex isn't held\nwhile the ->bind() callback is invoked.  So we'll drop the mutex\nbefore performing the unbind callback and reacquire it afterward.\n\nWe'll also add a couple of comments to usb_gadget_activate() and\nusb_gadget_deactivate().  Because they run in process context they\nmust not be called from a gadget driver's ->disconnect() callback,\nwhich (according to the kerneldoc for struct usb_gadget_driver in\ninclude/linux/usb/gadget.h) may run in interrupt context.  This may\nhelp prevent similar bugs from arising in the future."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/65dadb2beeb7360232b09ebc4585b54475dfee06", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c1edc00db65f6d4408b3d1cd845e8da3b9e0ca4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bed19d95fcb9c98dfaa9585922b39a2dfba7898d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
