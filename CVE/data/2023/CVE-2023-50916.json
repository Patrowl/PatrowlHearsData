It allows administrators to configure the backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the use of a \\ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set, Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:kyocera:device_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "3.1.1213.0", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 5.9}}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-10T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:37Z"}
