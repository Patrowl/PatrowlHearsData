The vulnerability exists between the Assets Discovery application (formerly known as Insight Discovery) and the Assets Discovery agent.\n\nAssets Discovery, which can be downloaded via Atlassian Marketplace, is a network scanning tool that can be used with or without an agent with Jira Service Management Cloud, Data Center or Server. It detects hardware and software that is connected to your local network and extracts detailed information about each asset. This data can then be imported into Assets in Jira Service Management to help you manage all of the devices and configuration items within your local network."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-12-06T05:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-12-06T05:15Z"}
