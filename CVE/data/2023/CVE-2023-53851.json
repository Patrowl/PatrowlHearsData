The KASAN-reported use-after-free also\nremains, as the DP aux \"module\" explicitly frees its devres-allocated\nmemory in this code path.\n\nAs such, explicitly depopulate the aux bus in the error path, and in the\ncomponent unbind path, to avoid these issues.\n\nPatchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/542163/"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2fde37445807e6e6d7981402d0bf1be0e5d81291", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a7bfb2ad2184a1fba78be35209b6019aa8cc8d4d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e09ed06938807cb113cddd0708ed74bd8cdaff33", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
