The vulnerability arises out of a failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape archives).\u00a0The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains to the names of the files contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker can specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product.\u00a0This issue was fixed as part of BNSF-36456 patch. This patch was automatically applied to all customer appliances."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-24T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-24T19:15Z"}
