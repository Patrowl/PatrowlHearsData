Prior to version 2022.10, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a NULL pointer dereference while encoding a 6LoWPAN IPHC header. The NULL pointer dereference causes a hard fault exception, leading to denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patches manually."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-04-24T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-24T16:52Z"}
