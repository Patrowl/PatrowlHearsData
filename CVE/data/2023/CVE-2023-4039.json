This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:gnu:gcc:*:*:*:*:*:*:arm64:*", "versionEndExcluding": "2023-09-12", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 2.5}}, "publishedDate": "2023-09-13T09:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:34Z"}
