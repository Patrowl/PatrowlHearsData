An attacker can send a crafted frame to the device resulting in a large out of bounds write beyond the packet buffer. The write will create a hard fault exception after reaching the last page of RAM. The hard fault is not handled and the system will be stuck until reset. Thus the impact is denial of service. Version 2022.10 fixes this issue. As a workaround, apply the patch manually."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-04-24T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-24T15:35Z"}
