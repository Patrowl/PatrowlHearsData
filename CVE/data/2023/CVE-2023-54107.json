If pd_free_fn() for parent is called\nbefore child, then UAF can be triggered. Hence it's better to guarantee\nthe order of pd_free_fn().\n\nCurrently refcount of parent blkg is dropped in __blkg_release(), which\nis before pd_free_fn() is called in blkg_free_work_fn() while\nblkg_free_work_fn() is called asynchronously.\n\nThis patch make sure pd_free_fn() called from removing cgroup is ordered\nby delaying dropping parent refcount after calling pd_free_fn() for\nchild.\n\nBTW, pd_free_fn() will also be called from blkcg_deactivate_policy()\nfrom deleting device, and following patches will guarantee the order."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c7241babf0855d8a6180cd1743ff0ec34de40b4e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
