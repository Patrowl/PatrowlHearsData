If it's not the same it means that\nit's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is\naborted because the local entry contains stale data.\n\nReproducer:\nI originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work\non the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test\nmachine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so\nwhatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do\nthe trick.\n\nIn order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of\navailable memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1\n--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens\nof minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging\n/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20\nand 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It's crucial to set\n`--vm-stride` to something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won't\nrealize that memory has been corrupted because all pages would have the\nsame data."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04fc7816089c5a32c29a04ec94b998e219dfb946", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2cab13f500a6333bd2b853783ac76be9e4956f8a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba700ea13bf0105a4773c654f7d3bef8adb64ab2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-362"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.0, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "C6DE89D5-1124-43A1-92F8-7F391638AE90", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "3.11", "versionEndExcluding": "6.1.30"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "26C54BF0-3EED-46D4-92A7-5F07F658B49B", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "6.2", "versionEndExcluding": "6.3.4"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.4:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "38BC6744-7D25-4C02-9966-B224CD071D30", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.4:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "76061B41-CAE9-4467-BEDE-0FFC7956F2A1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
