If it's not the same it means that\nit's either been invalidated or replaced, in both cases the writeback is\naborted because the local entry contains stale data.\n\nReproducer:\nI originally found this by running `stress` overnight to validate my work\non the zswap writeback mechanism, it manifested after hours on my test\nmachine.  The key to make it happen is having zswap writebacks, so\nwhatever setup pumps /sys/kernel/debug/zswap/written_back_pages should do\nthe trick.\n\nIn order to reproduce this faster on a vm, I setup a system with ~100M of\navailable memory and a 500M swap file, then running `stress --vm 1\n--vm-bytes 300000000 --vm-stride 4000` makes it happen in matter of tens\nof minutes.  One can speed things up even more by swinging\n/sys/module/zswap/parameters/max_pool_percent up and down between, say, 20\nand 1; this makes it reproduce in tens of seconds.  It's crucial to set\n`--vm-stride` to something other than 4096 otherwise `stress` won't\nrealize that memory has been corrupted because all pages would have the\nsame data."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04fc7816089c5a32c29a04ec94b998e219dfb946", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2cab13f500a6333bd2b853783ac76be9e4956f8a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba700ea13bf0105a4773c654f7d3bef8adb64ab2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
