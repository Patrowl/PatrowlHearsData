The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check will be skipped.\u00a0As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader, essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree.\u00a0Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the issue.\n\nAlternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue.\n\nSee the documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-10-11T12:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-10-11T12:54Z"}
