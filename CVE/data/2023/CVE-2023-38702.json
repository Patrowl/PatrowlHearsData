Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-08-04T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-08-04T19:15Z"}
