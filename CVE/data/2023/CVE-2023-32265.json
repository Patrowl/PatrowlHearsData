As described in the hardening guide in the product documentation, other mitigations including restricting network access to ESCWA and restricting users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 permissions in the Micro Focus Directory Server also reduce the exposure to this issue.\n\nGiven the right conditions this vulnerability could be exploited to expose a service account password. The account corresponding to the exposed credentials usually has limited privileges and, in many cases would only be useful for extracting details of other user accounts and similar information.\n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-07-20T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-07-20T16:45Z"}
