SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This vulnerability\u2019s impact may range from unexpected application termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is available as a commit in the master branch.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:teluu:pjsip:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndIncluding": "2.13.1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9}}, "publishedDate": "2023-10-06T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:14Z"}
