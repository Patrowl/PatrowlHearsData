The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. User input coming from the `db_name` in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_list` endpoint is passed to the methods that follow in a given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to `sql/engines/mssql.py`, and `get_group_tables_by_db` in `sql/engines/oracle.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/oracle.py` `query` method. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-105`."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-04-19T00:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-19T00:15Z"}
