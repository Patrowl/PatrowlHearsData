Versions prior to 2.8.13 (stable), 3.0.0.beta16 (beta) and 3.0.0beta16 (tests-passed), are vulnerable to cross-site Scripting. A maliciously crafted URL can be included in a post to carry out cross-site scripting attacks on sites with disabled or overly permissive CSP (Content Security Policy). Discourse's default CSP prevents this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in versions 2.8.13 (stable), 3.0.0.beta16 (beta) and 3.0.0beta16 (tests-passed). As a workaround, enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-01-26T21:18Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-01-27T14:03Z"}
