This, in turn, allows the attacker to perform unauthorized interaction with the network services exposed by the drone and to potentially decrypt the Wi-Fi traffic exchanged between the drone and the Android/IOS device of the legitimate user during QuickTransfer mode. Affected models are Mavic 3 Pro until v01.01.0300, Mavic 3 until v01.00.1200, Mavic 3 Classic until v01.00.0500, Mavic 3 Enterprise until v07.01.10.03, Matrice 300 until v57.00.01.00, Matrice M30 until v07.01.0022 and Mini 3 Pro until v01.00.0620."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-04-02T11:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:44Z"}
