This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. Administrators can give button creation privileges to users with lower levels (contributor+) which would allow those lower-privileged users to carry out attacks."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-09T03:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-09T03:15Z"}
