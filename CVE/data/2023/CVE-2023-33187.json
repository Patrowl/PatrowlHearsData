Highlight may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html input is switched to `type=\"text\"` via a javascript \"Show Password\" button. This differs from the expected behavior which always obfuscates `type=\"password\"` inputs. A customer may assume that switching to `type=\"text\"` would also not record this input; hence, they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was patched in version 6.0.0.\nThis patch tracks changes to the `type` attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a `type=\"password\"` continues to be obfuscated. \n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-26T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-28T02:28Z"}
