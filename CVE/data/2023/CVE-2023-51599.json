This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Honeywell Saia PG5 Controls Suite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of ZIP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.\n.
