This has two consequences:\n\n1) We move it out of the list of new block groups associated to the\n   current transaction. So the block group creation is not finished and\n   if we attempt to delete the bg because it's unused, we will not find\n   the block group item in the extent tree (or the new block group tree),\n   its device extent items in the device tree etc, resulting in the\n   deletion to fail due to the missing items;\n\n2) We don't increment the reference count on the block group when we\n   move it to the list of unused block groups, because we assumed the\n   block group was on the list of block groups to reclaim, and in that\n   case it already has the correct reference count. However the block\n   group was on the list of new block groups, in which case no extra\n   reference was taken because it's local to the current task. This\n   later results in doing an extra reference count decrement when\n   removing the block group from the unused list, eventually leading the\n   reference count to 0.\n\nThis second case was caught when running generic/297 from fstests, which\nproduced the following assertion failure and stack trace:\n\n  [589.559] assertion failed: refcount_read(&block_group->refs) == 1, in fs/btrfs/block-group.c:4299\n  [589.559] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n  [589.559] kernel BUG at fs/btrfs/block-group.c:4299!\n  [589.560] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n  [589.560] CPU: 8 PID: 2819134 Comm: umount Tainted: G        W          6.4.0-rc6-btrfs-next-134+ #1\n  [589.560] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.2-0-gea1b7a073390-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n  [589.560] RIP: 0010:btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.561] Code: 68 62 da c0 (...)\n  [589.561] RSP: 0018:ffffa55a8c3b3d98 EFLAGS: 00010246\n  [589.561] RAX: 0000000000000058 RBX: ffff8f030d7f2000 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  [589.562] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffffff953f0878 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n  [589.562] RBP: ffff8f030d7f2088 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffa55a8c3b3c50\n  [589.562] R10: 0000000000000001 R11: 0000000000000001 R12: ffff8f05850b4c00\n  [589.562] R13: ffff8f030d7f2090 R14: ffff8f05850b4cd8 R15: dead000000000100\n  [589.563] FS:  00007f497fd2e840(0000) GS:ffff8f09dfc00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  [589.563] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  [589.563] CR2: 00007f497ff8ec10 CR3: 0000000271472006 CR4: 0000000000370ee0\n  [589.563] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n  [589.564] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n  [589.564] Call Trace:\n  [589.564]  <TASK>\n  [589.565]  ? __die_body+0x1b/0x60\n  [589.565]  ? die+0x39/0x60\n  [589.565]  ? do_trap+0xeb/0x110\n  [589.565]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.566]  ? do_error_trap+0x6a/0x90\n  [589.566]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.566]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x4e/0x70\n  [589.566]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.567]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n  [589.567]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.567]  ? btrfs_free_block_groups+0x449/0x4a0 [btrfs]\n  [589.567]  close_ctree+0x35d/0x560 [btrfs]\n  [589.568]  ? fsnotify_sb_delete+0x13e/0x1d0\n  [589.568]  ? dispose_list+0x3a/0x50\n  [589.568]  ? evict_inodes+0x151/0x1a0\n  [589.568]  generic_shutdown_super+0x73/0x1a0\n  [589.569]  kill_anon_super+0x14/0x30\n  [589.569]  btrfs_kill_super+0x12/0x20 [btrfs]\n  [589.569]  deactivate_locked\n---truncated---"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0657b20c5a76c938612f8409735a8830d257866e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6297644db23f77c02ae7961cc542d162629ae2c4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7569c4294ba6ff9f194635b14876198f8a687c4a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
