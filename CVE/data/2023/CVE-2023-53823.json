Hoever, in case that rq_qos dynamically destruction is supported\n   in the furture, this patch also protect rq_qos_add() from wbt_init()\n   directly, this is enough because blk-sysfs already synchronize\n   writers with disk removal.\n\n3) For iocost and iolatency, in order to synchronize disk removal and\n   cgroup configuration, the lock is held after blkdev_get_no_open()\n   from blkg_conf_open_bdev(), and is released in blkg_conf_exit().\n   In order to fix the above memory leak, disk_live() is checked after\n   holding the new lock."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16398b4638b5cd8c1dc95fc940a1591a801d53ce", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a13bd91be22318768d55470cbc0b0f4488ef9edf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
