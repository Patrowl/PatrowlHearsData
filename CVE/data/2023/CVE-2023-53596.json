This is happening in the DRM framework for example.\n\nWe should thus call devres_release_all() in the device_del() function to\nmake sure that the device-managed actions are properly executed when the\ndevice is unregistered, even if it has neither a bus nor a driver.\n\nThis is effectively the same change than commit 2f8d16a996da (\"devres:\nrelease resources on device_del()\") that got reverted by commit\na525a3ddeaca (\"driver core: free devres in device_release\") over\nmemory leaks concerns.\n\nThis patch effectively combines the two commits mentioned above to\nrelease the resources both on device_del() and device_release() and get\nthe best of both worlds."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/297992e5c63528e603666e36081836204fc36ec9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3bcc4c2a096e8342c8c719e595ce15de212694dd", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/699fb50d99039a50e7494de644f96c889279aca3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c8c426fae26086a0ca8ab6cc6da2de79810ec038", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
