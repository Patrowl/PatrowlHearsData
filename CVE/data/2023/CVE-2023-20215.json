An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an affected device to connect to a malicious server and receiving crafted HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-08-03T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-08-04T02:45Z"}
