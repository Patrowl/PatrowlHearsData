This\ncan lead to a kernel panic due to NULL pointer access of the blkg\npointer. The missing initialization of sync is less problematic and\ncan be a problem in a debug kernel due to missing lockdep initialization.\n\nFix these problems by re-initializing them after memory clearing."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d2af77e31ade05ff7ccc3658c3635ec1bea0979", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/abbce7f82613ea5eeefd0fc3c1c8e449b9cef2a2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b0d26283af612b9e0cc3188b0b88ad7fdea447e8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
