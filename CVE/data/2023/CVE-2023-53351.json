However now it depends on whether the interrupt service routine\ndrm_sched_fault is executed after gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start is completed which sets the ready\nfield of the scheduler to true even  for uninitialized schedulers and causes oops vs\nno fault or when ISR  drm_sched_fault is completed prior  gfx_v9_0_cp_gfx_start and\nNULL pointer dereference does not occur.\n\nUse the field timeout_wq  to prevent oops for uninitialized schedulers.\nThe field could be initialized by the work queue of resetting the domain.\n\nv1: Corrections to commit message (Luben)"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2da5bffe9eaa5819a868e8eaaa11b3fd0f16a691", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c43a96fc00b662cef1ef0eb22d40441ce2abae8f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
