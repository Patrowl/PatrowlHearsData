The`reports_admin.php` script displays reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc.\nCENSUS found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report.
