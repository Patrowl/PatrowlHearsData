After installing the Cloudflare WARP Client (admin privileges required), an MSI-Installer is placed under C:\\Windows\\Installer. The vulnerability lies in the repair function of this MSI. ImpactAn unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit this vulnerability to perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context, including deleting arbitrary files and reading arbitrary file content. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including the manipulation of system files and privilege escalation. PatchesA new installer with a fix that addresses this vulnerability was released in version 2023.3.381.0. While the WARP Client itself is not vulnerable (only the installer), users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version and delete any older installers present in their systems."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-04-05T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-04-05T17:35Z"}
