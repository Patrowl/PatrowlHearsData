Running Auto-GPT version prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml file from the one suggested in the official docker set up instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the `execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version 0.4.3."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4761", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gj-2chr-4ch6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/4761", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/security/advisories/GHSA-x5gj-2chr-4ch6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-94"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.0, "impactScore": 6.0, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:agpt:auto-gpt:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "10E8D9E9-E73C-4B20-989E-1D432F7ED3BB", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "0.4.3"}]}]}}
