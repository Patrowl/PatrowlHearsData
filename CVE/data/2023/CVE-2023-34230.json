In order to exploit the potential for command injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/security/advisories/GHSA-223g-8w3x-98wr", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-net/security/advisories/GHSA-223g-8w3x-98wr", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch", "Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-77"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:snowflake:snowflake_connector:*:*:*:*:*:.net:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "3F2B47AA-5292-4976-96FF-2AD422FAE0BA", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "2.0.18"}]}]}}
