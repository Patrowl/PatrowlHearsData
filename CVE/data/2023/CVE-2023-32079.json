A Mass assignment vulnerability was found in versions prior to 0.17.1 and 0.18.6 that allows a non-admin user to escalate privileges to those of an admin user. The issue is patched in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If Users are using 0.17.1, they should run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`. This will switch them to the patched users If users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a workaround, someone using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest docker image of the backend and restart the server."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-08-24T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-08-25T03:55Z"}
