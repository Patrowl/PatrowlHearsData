A time-based blind injection vulnerability existed in Time Tracker reports in versions prior to 1.22.13.5792. This was happening because the `reports.php` page was not validating all parameters in POST requests. Because some parameters were not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue is fixed in version 1.22.13.5792. As a workaround, use the fixed code in `ttReportHelper.class.php` from version 1.22.13.5792."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-12T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-15T12:54Z"}
