All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the\n   above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to\n   be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: \"If the ACK is a\n   duplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK\n   acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an\n   ACK, drop the segment, and return\".  The \"ignored\" above implies that\n   the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means\n   the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the\n   ACK check more stringent since any ACK < SND.UNA wouldn't be\n   accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -\n   MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT) get through.\n\nThis can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,\nby not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.\n\nThis greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.\n\nI added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,\neven if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.\n\ntp->bytes_acked was added in linux-4.2\n\nFollowing packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows\nthe issue at hand:\n\n0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3\n+0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0\n+0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0\n+0 listen(3, 1024) = 0\n\n// ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //\n\n// when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to\n// 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440.
