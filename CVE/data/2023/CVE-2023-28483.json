The GSQL query language provides users with the ability to write data to files on a remote TigerGraph server. The locations that a query is allowed to write to are configurable via the GSQL.FileOutputPolicy configuration setting. GSQL queries that contain UDFs can bypass this configuration setting and, as a consequence, can write to any file location to which the administrative user has access."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-08-14T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-08-15T12:29Z"}
