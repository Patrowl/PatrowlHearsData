The Archery project contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an attacker to query the connected databases. User input coming from the `variable_name` and `variable_value` parameter value in the `sql/instance.py` `param_edit` endpoint is passed to a set of methods in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are: `set_variable` in `sql/engines/goinception.py` which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py`, `get_variables` in `sql/engines/goinception.py`  which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py`, `set_variable` in `sql/engines/mysql.py`  which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/mysql.py` `query`, and `get_variables` in `sql/engines/mysql.py`which concatenates input which is passed to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/mysql.py` `query`. Each of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This advisory is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-104`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/instance.py#L161-L202", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-6mqc-w2qp-fvhp", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Mitigation", "Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/blob/bc86cda4c3b7d59f759d0d23bb63a54f52616752/sql/instance.py#L161-L202", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/hhyo/Archery/security/advisories/GHSA-6mqc-w2qp-fvhp", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Mitigation", "Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-89"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:archerydms:archery:1.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "DCE3AAB2-FAE8-440E-8BD4-3367BF3639D5", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
