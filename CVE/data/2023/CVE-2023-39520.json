The MSI installer provided on the homepage for Cryptomator version 1.9.2 allows local privilege escalation for low privileged users, via the `repair` function. The problem occurs as the repair function of the MSI is spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile` parameter. Therefore the profile of the user starting the repair will be loaded. Version 1.9.3 contains a fix for this issue. Adding a `-NoProfile` to the powershell is a possible workaround."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-08-07T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-08-07T20:15Z"}
