This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information. A successful exploit could also cause the web application to perform arbitrary HTTP requests on behalf of the attacker or consume memory resources to reduce the availability of the web-based management interface. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Super Admin or Policy Admin credentials."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:3.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "3.2", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 6.0, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 4.7}}, "publishedDate": "2023-04-05T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T07:40Z"}
