Starting in version 7.0.0 and prior to versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0, a user with access to the backoffice can upload SVG files that include scripts. If the user can trick another user to load the media directly in a browser, the scripts can be executed. Versions 7.15.11, 8.18.9, 10.7.0, 11.5.0, and 12.2.0 contain a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are available. Implement the server side file validation or serve all media from an different host (e.g cdn) than where Umbraco is hosted."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-12-12T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-12-12T20:20Z"}
