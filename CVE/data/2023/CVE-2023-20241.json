An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by logging in to an affected device at the same time that another user is accessing Cisco Secure Client on the same system, and then sending crafted packets to a port on that local host. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the VPN Agent service, causing it to be unavailable to all users of the system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials on a multi-user system."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-11-22T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-11-22T17:31Z"}
