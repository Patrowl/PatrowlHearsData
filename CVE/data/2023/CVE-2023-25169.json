In affected versions a user present in a yearly review topic that is then anonymised will still have some data linked to its original account. This issue has been patched in commit `b3ab33bbf7` which is included in the latest version of the Discourse Yearly Review plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable the `yearly_review_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the issue. Also, it's possible to edit the anonymised user's old data in the yearly review topics manually."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/commit/b3ab33bbf7130fca54764cf0336395a8a1eeaf3c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/security/advisories/GHSA-x2r8-v85c-x3x7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Mitigation", "Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/commit/b3ab33bbf7130fca54764cf0336395a8a1eeaf3c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-yearly-review/security/advisories/GHSA-x2r8-v85c-x3x7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Mitigation", "Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-200"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_yearly_review:*:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "1C0B6C1E-A6EA-42E5-8DF9-85324D5BF5CB", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "0.2"}]}]}}
