Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `reports_admin.php` displays reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious device name, related to a graph attached to a report, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any super user who has privileges of viewing the `reports_admin.php` page, such as administrative accounts. A user that possesses the _General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the report. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually filter HTML output.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-09-06T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-09-06T18:15Z"}
