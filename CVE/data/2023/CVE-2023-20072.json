This vulnerability is due to the improper handling of large fragmented tunnel protocol packets. One example of a tunnel protocol is Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted fragmented packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-03-23T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-03-24T01:57Z"}
