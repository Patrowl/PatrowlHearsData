Some parts of the Web application are dynamically built using user's inputs. Yet, those inputs are not verified nor filtered by the application, so they mathed the expected format. Therefore, when HTML/JavaScript code is injected into those fields, this code will be saved by the application and executed by the web browser of the user viewing the web page. Several injection points have been identified on the application. The major one requires the user to be authenticated with a common account, he can then target an Administrator. All others endpoints need the malicious user to be authenticated as an Administrator. Therefore, the impact is diminished."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "http://sage.com", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Product"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Digitemis/Advisory/blob/main/CVE-2023-31868.txt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "http://sage.com", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Product"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/Digitemis/Advisory/blob/main/CVE-2023-31868.txt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.3, "impactScore": 2.7, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:sage:x3:12.14.0.50-0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "E02F0A76-5C3C-4F96-B67E-E6BED5F39C57", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
