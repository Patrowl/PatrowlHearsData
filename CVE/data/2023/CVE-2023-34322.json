Since Xen itself\nneeds to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run\ndirectly the respective shadow page tables.  For 64-bit PV guests this\nmeans running on the shadow of the guest root page table.\n\nIn the course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool\nassociated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.  This\ntearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU in\nquestion is presently running on.  While a precaution exists to\nsupposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,\nthe time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-05T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-05T18:23Z"}
