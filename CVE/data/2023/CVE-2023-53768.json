After that, the logic attempts to\nallocate the memory required to hold the register configuration for\neach row. However, instead of doing this allocation for each row\n(i.e. num_config_bases allocations), the logic erroneously does this\nallocation num_config_regs number of times.\n\nThis scenario can lead to out-of-bounds accesses when num_config_regs\nis greater than num_config_bases. Fix this by updating the terminating\ncondition of the loop that allocates the memory for holding the register\nconfiguration to allocate memory only for each row in the matrix.\n\nAmit Pundir reported a crash that was occurring on his db845c device\ndue to memory corruption (see \"Closes\" tag for Amit's report).
