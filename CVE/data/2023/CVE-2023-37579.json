Many sources and sinks contain credentials in the configuration, which could lead to leaked credentials. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that there is not a known way for an authenticated user to enumerate another tenant's sources or sinks, meaning the source or sink name would need to be guessed in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe recommended mitigation for impacted users is to upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker to a patched version.\n\n2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4.\n2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1.\n3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users are unaffected.\nAny users running the Pulsar Function Worker for 2.9.* and earlier should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.\n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-07-12T10:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-07-12T10:15Z"}
