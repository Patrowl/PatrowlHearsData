However, the check is performed without a proper\nlock and the allocation isn't serialized; this allows user to allocate\nmore memories than predefined max size.\n\nPractically seen, this isn't really a big problem, as it's more or\nless some \"soft limit\" as a sanity check, and it's not possible to\nallocate unlimitedly.  But it's still better to address this for more\nconsistent behavior.\n\nThe patch covers the size check in do_alloc_pages() with the\ncard->memory_mutex, and increases the allocated size there for\npreventing the further overflow.  When the actual allocation fails,\nthe size is decreased accordingly."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3eb4e47a94e3f76521d7d344696db61e6a9619c7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/773ccad902f67583a58b5650a2f8d8daf2e76fac", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e11c58b2620a22c67a5ae28d64ce383890ee9f4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e1d1456c8db9949459c5a24e8845cfe92430b0f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a0ab49e7a758b488b2090171a75d50735c0876f6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bd55842ed998a622ba6611fe59b3358c9f76773d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
