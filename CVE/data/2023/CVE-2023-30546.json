An off-by-one error can be triggered in the Antelope database management system in the Contiki-NG operating system in versions 4.8 and prior. The problem exists in the Contiki File System (CFS) backend for the storage of data (file os/storage/antelope/storage-cfs.c). In the functions `storage_get_index` and `storage_put_index`, a buffer for merging two strings is allocated with one byte less than the maximum size of the merged strings, causing subsequent function calls to the cfs_open function to read from memory beyond the buffer size. The vulnerability has been patched in the \"develop\" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2425."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:contiki-ng:contiki-ng:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndIncluding": "4.8", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.6}}, "publishedDate": "2023-04-26T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:00Z"}
