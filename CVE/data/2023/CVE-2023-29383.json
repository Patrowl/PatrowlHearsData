Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat /etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Issue Tracking"]}, {"url": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/commit/e5905c4b84d4fb90aefcd96ee618411ebfac663d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/687", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Issue Tracking"]}, {"url": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2023-29383-abusing-linux-chfn-to-misrepresent-etc-passwd/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-74"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-125"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:shadow_project:shadow:4.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "79B0C1D0-9CF5-451D-B3B3-750B64FD7575", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
