However, if it was configured using non-default settings, there is the possibility that exploiting this vulnerability could lead to system crashes and remote code execution."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-03-01T00:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-03-01T00:15Z"}
