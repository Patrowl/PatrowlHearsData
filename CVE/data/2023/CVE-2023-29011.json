The location of `connect.exe`'s config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be interpreted as `C:\\etc\\connectrc`. Since `C:\\etc` can be created by any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1. As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders. Alternatively, watch out for malicious `<drive>:\\etc\\connectrc` files on multi-user machines."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Release Notes"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.40.1.windows.1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Release Notes"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-g4fv-xjqw-q7jm", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-427"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:git_for_windows_project:git_for_windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "E740B447-D96A-40C3-AFA9-9B058379E04D", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "2.40.1"}]}]}}
