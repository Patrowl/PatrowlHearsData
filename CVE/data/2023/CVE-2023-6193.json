An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the slower rate than they are received; leading to storage of path validation data in an unbounded queue. \nQuiche versions greater than 0.19.0 address this problem."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-12-12T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-12-12T15:52Z"}
