Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a `LookupResources` request with 1.22.0 is affected. For example, using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not. But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally, `LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way - that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has included a warning about this bug since its initial release. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:authzed:spicedb:1.22.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4}}, "publishedDate": "2023-06-26T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:08Z"}
