Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-07-25T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-07-26T04:24Z"}
