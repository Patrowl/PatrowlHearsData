In versions prior to 1.5.3 when querying `subresults`, it is possible to query `subresults` from other users due to insufficient authorisation. This is only possible for logged-in users and it is not possible to associate the subresults with a specific user. This bug was fixed in commit `f1ae67d8bb2`and released with version 1.5.3.
