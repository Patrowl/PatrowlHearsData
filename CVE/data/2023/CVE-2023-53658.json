Apart from not doing\nanything meaningful, this would then also lead to a null pointer access\non removal, as platform_get_drvdata() would return NULL, which it would\nthen try to dereference when trying to unregister the spi master.\n\nFix this by unconditionally calling devm_ioremap_resource(), as it can\nhandle a NULL res and will then return a viable ERR_PTR() if we get one.\n\nThe \"return 0;\" was previously a \"goto qspi_resource_err;\" where then\nret was returned, but since ret was still initialized to 0 at this place\nthis was a valid conversion in 63c5395bb7a9 (\"spi: bcm-qspi: Fix\nuse-after-free on unbind\"). The issue was not introduced by this commit,\nonly made more obvious."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/217b6ea8cf7b819477bca597a6ae2d43d38ba283", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/22ae32d80ef590d12a2364e4621f90f7c58445c7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/32b9c8f7892c19f7f5c9fed5fb410b9fd5990bb6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/398e6a015877d44327f754aeb48ff3354945c78c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7c1f23ad34fcdace50275a6aa1e1969b41c6233f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a91c34357afcfaa5307e254f22a8452550a07b34", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d20db3c58a7f9361e370a7850ceb60dbdf62eea3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3dcdb43c872a3b967345144151a2c9bb9124c9b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
