So in the -EACCES case you must not call\npm_runtime_put().\n\nThe documentation for pm_runtime_get_sync() says:\n \"Consider using pm_runtime_resume_and_get() ...  as this is likely to\n result in cleaner code.\"\n\nIn this case I don't think it results in cleaner code because the\npm_runtime_put() at the end of the function would have to be conditional on\nthe return value from pm_runtime_resume_and_get() at the top of the\nfunction.\n\npm_runtime_get_sync() doesn't have this problem because it always\nincrements the count, so always needs a put. The code can just flow through\nand do the pm_runtime_put() unconditionally."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/203aa4374c433159f163acde2d0bd4118f23bbaf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e5e9da139c007dfc397a159093b4c4187ee67fa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e9537962519e88969f5f69cd0571eb4f6984403c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
