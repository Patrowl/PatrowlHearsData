Some codec runtime PM\nimplementations suffer from similar problems as waiting for enumeration\nduring resume can also timeout despite the device already having been\nenumerated."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48d1d0ce0782f995fda678508fdae35c5e9593f0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a36b522767f3a72688893a472e80c9aa03e67eda", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c40d6b3249b11d60e09d81530588f56233d9aa44", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c5265691cd065464d795de5666dcfb89c26b9bc1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1d54962a63b6ec04ed0204a3ecca942fde3a6fe", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
