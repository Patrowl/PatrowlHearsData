This vulnerability requires physical access to the serial interface of the module or the ability to modify the system or software which uses its serial interface to send malicious AT commands.\n\n\n\n\nExploitation of the vulnerability gives full administrative (root) privileges to the attacker to execute any operating system command on TOBY-L2 which can lead to modification of the behavior of the module itself as well as the components connected with it (depending on its rights on other connected systems). It can further provide the ability to read system level files and hamper the availability of the module as well..\n\n\n\n\nThis issue affects TOBY-L2 series: TOBY-L200, TOBY-L201, TOBY-L210, TOBY-L220, TOBY-L280.\n\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-12-20T08:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-12-20T13:50Z"}
