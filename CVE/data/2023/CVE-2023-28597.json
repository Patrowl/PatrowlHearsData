If a victim saves a local recording to an SMB location and later opens it using a link from Zoom\u2019s web portal, an attacker positioned on an adjacent network to the victim client could set up a malicious SMB server to respond to client requests, causing the client to execute attacker controlled executables. This could result in an attacker gaining access to a user's device and data, and remote code execution."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-03-27T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-03-27T21:15Z"}
