The result can be a NULL pointer dereference when\nsomeone accesses /proc/fs/nfsd/reply_cache_stats while nfsd is still\nshut down.\n\nThis is a regression and a user-triggerable oops in the right situation:\n\n- non-x86_64 arch\n- /proc/fs/nfsd is mounted in the namespace\n- nfsd is not started in the namespace\n- unprivileged user calls \"cat /proc/fs/nfsd/reply_cache_stats\"\n\nAlthough this is easy to trigger on some arches (like aarch64), on\nx86_64, calling this_cpu_ptr(NULL) evidently returns a pointer to the\nfixed_percpu_data. That struct looks just enough like a newly\ninitialized percpu var to allow nfsd_reply_cache_stats_show to access\nit without Oopsing.\n\nMove the initialization of the per-net+per-cpu reply-cache counters\nback into nfsd_init_net, while leaving the rest of the reply cache\nallocations to be done at nfsd startup time.\n\nKudos to Eirik who did most of the legwork to track this down."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3025d489f9c8984d1bf5916c4a20097ed80fca5c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66a178177b2b3bb1d71e854c5e7bbb320eb0e566", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/768c408594b52d8531e1a8ab62e5620c19213e73", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8549384d0f65981761fe2077d04fa2a8d37b54e0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed9ab7346e908496816cffdecd46932035f66e2e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
