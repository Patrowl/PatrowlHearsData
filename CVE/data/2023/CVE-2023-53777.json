As a\nconsequence, the corresponding file pages will remain locked forever.\n\nIt can be _only_ observed on data-deduplicated compressed images.\nFor example, consider two chains with five pclusters in total:\n\tChain 1:  2->3->4->5    -- The tail pcluster is 5;\n        Chain 2:  5->1->2       -- The tail pcluster is 2.\n\nChain 2 could link to Chain 1 with pcluster 5; and Chain 1 could link\nto Chain 2 at the same time with pcluster 2.\n\nSince hooked chains are all linked locklessly now, I have no idea how\nto simply avoid the race.  Instead, let's avoid hooked chains completely\nuntil I could work out a proper way to fix this and end users finally\ntell us that it's needed to add it back.\n\nActually, this optimization can be found with multi-threaded workloads\n(especially even more often on deduplicated compressed images), yet I'm\nnot sure about the overall system impacts of not having this compared\nwith implementation complexity."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10c2b98a40d9044a3e97f4697ca6213bad7e19c2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/967c28b23f6c89bb8eef6a046ea88afe0d7c1029", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5b0d52f00e4bacb0ebdf47cd7016b0485fffad2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3b39ea24835ac03da1a30f93ae7c05d55a40191", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
