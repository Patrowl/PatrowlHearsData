After further\nanalisys the Xen Security Team is no longer confident in the suitability of\nlibfsimage when run against guest controlled input with super user priviledges.\n\nIn order to not affect current deployments that rely on pygrub patches are\nprovided in the resolution section of the advisory that allow running pygrub in\ndeprivileged mode.\n\nCVE-2023-4949 refers to the original issue in the upstream grub\nproject (\"An attacker with local access to a system (either through a\ndisk or external drive) can present a modified XFS partition to\ngrub-legacy in such a way to exploit a memory corruption in grub\u2019s XFS\nfile system implementation.\")  CVE-2023-34325 refers specifically to\nthe vulnerabilities in Xen's copy of libfsimage, which is decended\nfrom a very old version of grub.\n"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-05T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-05T18:23Z"}
