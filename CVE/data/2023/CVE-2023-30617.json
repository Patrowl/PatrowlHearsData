Starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2, an attacker who has gained root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, the attacker can leverage the \"captured\" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager service account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification. Versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is available. For users that do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret get/list privilege."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-03T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-03T16:15Z"}
