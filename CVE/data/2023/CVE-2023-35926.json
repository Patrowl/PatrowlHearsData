The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fb7375507d56faedcb7bb3665480070593c8949a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.15.0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Release Notes"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/commit/fb7375507d56faedcb7bb3665480070593c8949a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/releases/tag/v1.15.0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Release Notes"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/GHSA-wg6p-jmpc-xjmr", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-94"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.1, "impactScore": 6.0, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.9, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:backstage:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "41D3145E-0089-49C3-AFAA-7994C26E230A", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "1.15.0"}]}]}}
