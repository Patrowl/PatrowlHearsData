After that wait_event_killable() is interrupted (it returns\n-ERESTARTSYS), so that 'wq->name.name == NULL' condition may be not\nsatisfied. Actually, this condition can be satisfied when\nautofs_wait_release() or autofs_catatonic_mode() is called and, what is\nalso important, wait_ctr is decremented in those places. Upon the exit of\nautofs_wait(), wait_ctr is decremented to 1. Then the unmounting process\nbegins: kill_sb calls autofs_catatonic_mode(), which should have freed the\nwaitqueues, but it only decrements its usage counter to zero which is not\na correct behaviour.\n\nedit:imk\nThis description is of course not correct. The umount performed as a result\nof an expire is a umount of a mount that has been automounted, it's not the\nautofs mount itself. They happen independently, usually after everything\nmounted within the autofs file system has been expired away. If everything\nhasn't been expired away the automount daemon can still exit leaving mounts\nin place. But expires done in both cases will result in a notification that\ncalls autofs_wait_release() with a result status. The problem case is the\nsummary execution of of the automount daemon. In this case any waiting\nprocesses won't be woken up until either they are terminated or the mount\nis umounted.\nend edit: imk\n\nSo in catatonic mode we should free waitqueues which counter becomes zero.\n\nedit: imk\nInitially I was concerned that the calling of autofs_wait_release() and\nautofs_catatonic_mode() was not mutually exclusive but that can't be the\ncase (obviously) because the queue entry (or entries) is removed from the\nlist when either of these two functions are called. Consequently the wait\nentry will be freed by only one of these functions or by the woken process\nin autofs_wait() depending on the order of the calls.\nend edit: imk"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1985e8eae8627f02e3364690c5fed7af1c46be55", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6079dc77c6f32936e8a6766ee8334ae3c99f4504", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/696b625f3f85d80fca48c24d2948fbc451e74366", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69ddafc7a7afd8401bab53eff5af813fa0d368a2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71eeddcad7342292c19042c290c477697acaccab", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/726deae613bc1b6096ad3b61cc1e63e33330fbc2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/976abbdc120a97049b9133e60fa7b29627d11de4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ccbe77f7e45dfb4420f7f531b650c00c6e9c7507", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
