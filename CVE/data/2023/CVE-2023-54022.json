However, free_midi_urbs()\nloops only for ep->num_urbs entries, and since ep->num_entries wasn't\nupdated yet at the allocation / init error in alloc_midi_urbs(), this\nentry won't be released.\n\nThe intention of free_midi_urbs() is to release the whole elements, so\nchange the loop size to NUM_URBS to scan over all elements for fixing\nthe missed releases.\n\nAlso, the call of free_midi_urbs() is missing at\nsnd_usb_midi_v2_open().  Although it'll be released later at\nreopen/close or disconnection, it's better to release immediately at\nthe error path."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1757fa30ef14f254f4719bf6f7d54a4c8207216", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f819b343aa95d24d5f7d6e06660c7f62591abc5f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
