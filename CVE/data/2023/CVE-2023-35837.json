Authentication for web interface is completed via an unauthenticated WiFi AP. The administrative password for the web interface has a default password, equal to the registration ID of the device. This same registration ID is used as the WiFi SSID name. No routine is in place to force a change to this password on first use or bring its default state to the attention of the user. Once authenticated, an attacker can reconfigure the device or upload new firmware, both of which can lead to Denial of Service, code execution, or Escalation of Privileges."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "AND", "children": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:solax:pocket_wifi_3_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "3.0.0", "versionEndIncluding": "3.009.03_20230504", "cpe_name": []}]}, {"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:h:solax:pocket_wifi_3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}], "cpe_match": []}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9}}, "publishedDate": "2024-01-23T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:08Z"}
