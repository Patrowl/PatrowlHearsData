WireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15, the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock\u2019s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.35.1 and 3.0.3 of wiremock. Wiremock studio has been discontinued and will not see a fix. Users unable to upgrade should use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:studio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndIncluding": "2.32.0-17", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "3.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "3.0.3", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:wiremock:wiremock:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "2.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "2.35.1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 2.5}}, "publishedDate": "2023-09-06T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:21Z"}
