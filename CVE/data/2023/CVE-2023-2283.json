This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory usage is limited. The problem is caused by the return value `rc,` which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The value of the variable is not changed between this point and the cryptographic verification. Therefore any error between them calls `goto error` returning SSH_OK."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-26T18:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-28T02:28Z"}
