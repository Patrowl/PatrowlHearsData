However, it is accessed without\nholding the lock when is accessed in snd_hdac_regmap_sync():\n\n  if (codec->regmap)\n\nIn my opinion, this may be a harmful race, because if codec->regmap is\nset to NULL right after the condition is checked, a null-pointer\ndereference can occur in the called function regcache_sync():\n\n  map->lock(map->lock_arg); --> Line 360 in drivers/base/regmap/regcache.c\n\nTo fix this possible null-pointer dereference caused by data race, the\nmutex_lock coverage is extended to protect the if statement as well as the\nfunction call to regcache_sync().\n\n[ Note: the lack of the regmap_lock itself is harmless for the current\n  codec driver implementations, as snd_hdac_regmap_sync() is only for\n  PM runtime resume that is prohibited during the codec probe.\n  But the change makes the whole code more consistent, so it's merged\n  as is -- tiwai ]"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/109f0aaa0b8838a88af9125b79579023539300a7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f4a08fed450db87fbb5ff5105354158bdbe1a22", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8703b26387e1fa4f8749db98d24c67617b873acb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f9eed451176ffcac6b5ba0f6dae1a6b4a1cb0eb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b32e40379e5b2814de0c4bc199edc2d82317dc07", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdd412b528dee6e0851c4735d6676ec138da13a4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
