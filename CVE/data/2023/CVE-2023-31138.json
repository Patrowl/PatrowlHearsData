Starting in the 2.36 branch and prior to versions 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, and 2.39.1.2, using object model traversal in the payload of a PATCH request, authenticated users with write access to an object may be able to modify related objects that they should not have access to. DHIS2 implementers should upgrade to a supported version of DHIS2 to receive a patch: 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, or 2.39.1.2. It is possible to work around this issue by blocking all PATCH requests on a reverse proxy, but this may cause some issues with the functionality of built-in applications using legacy PATCH requests."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "2.39.0", "versionEndExcluding": "2.39.1.2", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "2.38.0", "versionEndExcluding": "2.38.3.1", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:dhis2:dhis_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "2.36.0", "versionEndExcluding": "2.37.9.1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 3.6}}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-09T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T08:01Z"}
