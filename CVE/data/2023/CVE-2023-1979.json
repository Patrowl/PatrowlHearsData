The content is then only accessible to website visitors after entering the password. In WordPress, users with the \"Author\" role can create stories, but don't have the ability to edit password protected stories. The vulnerability allowed users with said role to bypass this permission check when trying to duplicate the protected story in the plugin's own dashboard, giving them access to the seemingly protected content.
