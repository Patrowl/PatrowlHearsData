If it is built to use the synchronous resolver, it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using `alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`. When doing this, libcurl used a global buffer that was not mutex protected and a multi-threaded application might therefore crash or otherwise misbehave."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-26T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-28T02:28Z"}
