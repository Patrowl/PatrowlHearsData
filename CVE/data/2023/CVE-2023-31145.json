This vulnerability report describes a reflected XSS vulnerability with full CSP bypass in Nextcloud installations using the recommended bundle. The vulnerability can be exploited to perform a trivial account takeover attack. The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into web pages, which can be executed in the context of the victim's browser session. This means that an attacker can steal sensitive data, such as login credentials or personal information, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying or deleting data. In this specific case, the vulnerability allows for a trivial account takeover attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to inject code into the victim's browser session, allowing the attacker to take over the victim's account without their knowledge or consent. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and data, as well as the ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim. Furthermore, the fact that the vulnerability bypasses the Content Security Policy (CSP) makes it more dangerous, as CSP is an important security mechanism used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. By bypassing CSP, attackers can circumvent the security measures put in place by the web application and execute their malicious code. This issue has been patched in versions 22.05.13, 21.11.9, and 6.4.27. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-rqj2-2c2x-gjmm", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/security/advisories/GHSA-rqj2-2c2x-gjmm", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 2.7, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "098C5EA7-08FA-4765-916B-4BDC839093FB", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "6.4.27"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "2E9E333F-1435-4133-B77C-95A2BD557AB8", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "21.06.2", "versionEndExcluding": "21.11.9"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:collabora:online:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "3996A955-91D7-425D-AE9D-B7BDF4ED78C2", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "22.05.0", "versionEndExcluding": "22.05.13"}]}]}}
