This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which may make remote code execution possible. Additionally, the attacker can also delete files on the server such as database configuration files, subsequently uploading their own database files."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/9219", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/wordpress-plugin-wp-cost-estimation-payment-forms-builder-multiple-vulnerabilities-9-642/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/02/vulnerabilities-patched-in-wp-cost-estimation-plugin/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/ae50aa5d-95e3-4650-9dbf-118b4ba3abda?source=cve", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/another-wordpress-commercial-plugin-gets-exploited-in-the-wild/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/02/vulnerabilities-patched-in-wp-cost-estimation-plugin/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-434"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
