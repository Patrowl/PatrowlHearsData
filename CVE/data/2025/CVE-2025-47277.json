No other configurations are affected. vLLM supports the use of the\u00a0`PyNcclPipe`\u00a0class to establish a peer-to-peer communication domain for data transmission between distributed nodes. The GPU-side KV-Cache transmission is implemented through the\u00a0`PyNcclCommunicator`\u00a0class, while CPU-side control message passing is handled via the\u00a0`send_obj`\u00a0and\u00a0`recv_obj`\u00a0methods on the CPU side.\u200b The intention was that this interface should only be exposed to a private network using the IP address specified by the `--kv-ip` CLI parameter. The vLLM documentation covers how this must be limited to a secured network. The default and intentional behavior from PyTorch is that the `TCPStore` interface listens on ALL interfaces, regardless of what IP address is provided. The IP address given was only used as a client-side address to use. vLLM was fixed to use a workaround to force the `TCPStore` instance to bind its socket to a specified private interface. As of version 0.8.5, vLLM limits the `TCPStore` socket to the private interface as configured."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hjq4-87xh-g4fv", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-hjq4-87xh-g4fv"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/15988", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/15988"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/0d6e187e88874c39cda7409cf673f9e6546893e7", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/0d6e187e88874c39cda7409cf673f9e6546893e7"}, {"name": "https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/deployment/security.html"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-502"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
