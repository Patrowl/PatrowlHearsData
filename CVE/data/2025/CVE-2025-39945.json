Additionally, the delayed work\nitem is cyclic, the flush_workqueue() in cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw() only\nblocks and waits for work items that were already queued to the\nworkqueue prior to its invocation. Any work items submitted after\nflush_workqueue() is called are not included in the set of tasks that the\nflush operation awaits. This means that after the cyclic work items have\nfinished executing, a delayed work item may still exist in the workqueue.\nThis leads to use-after-free scenarios where the cnic_dev is deallocated\nby cnic_free_dev(), while delete_task remains active and attempt to\ndereference cnic_dev in cnic_delete_task().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup)              | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\ncnic_netdev_event()          |\n  cnic_stop_hw()             | cnic_delete_task()\n    cnic_cm_stop_bnx2x_hw()  | ...\n      cancel_delayed_work()  | /* the queue_delayed_work()\n      flush_workqueue()      |    executes after flush_workqueue()*/\n                             | queue_delayed_work()\n  cnic_free_dev(dev)//free   | cnic_delete_task() //new instance\n                             |   dev = cp->dev; //use\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the cyclic delayed work item is properly canceled and that any\nongoing execution of the work item completes before the cnic_dev is\ndeallocated. Furthermore, since cancel_delayed_work_sync() uses\n__flush_work(work, true) to synchronously wait for any currently\nexecuting instance of the work item to finish, the flush_workqueue()\nbecomes redundant and should be removed.\n\nThis bug was identified through static analysis. To reproduce the issue\nand validate the fix, I simulated the cnic PCI device in QEMU and\nintroduced intentional delays \u2014 such as inserting calls to ssleep()\nwithin the cnic_delete_task() function \u2014 to increase the likelihood\nof triggering the bug."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0405055930264ea8fd26f4131466fa7652e5e47d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0627e1481676669cae2df0d85b5ff13e7d24c390", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6e33a7eed587062ca8161ad1f4584882a860d697", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b6a5b0a6b392263c3767fc945b311ea04b34bbd", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8eeb2091e72d75df8ceaa2172638d61b4cf8929a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cfa7d9b1e3a8604afc84e9e51d789c29574fb216", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1fcd4a9c09feac0902a65615e866dbf22616125", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fde6e73189f40ebcf0633aed2b68e731c25f3aa3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
