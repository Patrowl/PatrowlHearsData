When this occurs while a CPU is\nconnected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad\nstate after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU\nthat is transitioning through the default root domain may push a\ndeadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its\nfree_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the\nopportunity to run.\n\nOne example is outlined here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com\n\nAnother occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a\nCPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of\nthe deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear\nand set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.\n\nThis commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the\nonline state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask\ncan be updated appropriately.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the\ncpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is\nnow only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to\nuse the non-atomic __cpumask functions."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/382748c05e58a9f1935f5a653c352422375566ea", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3ed049fbfb4d75b4e0b8ab54c934f485129d5dc8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9019e399684e3cc68c4a3f050e268f74d69c1317", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/91e448e69aca4bb0ba2e998eb3e555644db7322b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dbc61834b0412435df21c71410562d933e4eba49", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fb36846cbcc936954f2ad2bffdff13d16c0be08a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
