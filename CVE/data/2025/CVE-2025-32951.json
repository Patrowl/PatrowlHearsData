In versions 1.0.0 to 1.6.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.3.4, the input parameter, which consists of a file path and name, can be manipulated to return the Content-Type header with text/html if the name part ends with .html. This could allow malicious JavaScript code to be executed in the browser. For a successful attack, a malicious file needs to be uploaded beforehand. This issue has been patched in versions 1.6.2 and 2.4.0. A workaround is provided on the Jmix documentation website."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/security/advisories/GHSA-x27v-f838-jh93"}, {"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3804", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3804"}, {"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3836", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/issues/3836"}, {"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/6a66aa3adb967159a30d703e80403406f4c8f7a2", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/6a66aa3adb967159a30d703e80403406f4c8f7a2"}, {"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/c589ef4e2b25620770b8036f4ad05f1a6250cb6a", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/c589ef4e2b25620770b8036f4ad05f1a6250cb6a"}, {"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/cc97e6ff974b9e7af8160fab39cc5866169daa37", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/cc97e6ff974b9e7af8160fab39cc5866169daa37"}, {"name": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/f4e6fb05bd245cf36f3e9319aaa0fcd540d024aa", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/jmix-framework/jmix/commit/f4e6fb05bd245cf36f3e9319aaa0fcd540d024aa"}, {"name": "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html"}, {"name": "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-jmix-application", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://docs.jmix.io/jmix/files-vulnerabilities.html#disable-files-endpoint-in-jmix-application"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
