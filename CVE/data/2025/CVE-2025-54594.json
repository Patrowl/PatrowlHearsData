In versions 0.9.2 and below, the github/workflows/release-canary.yml GitHub Actions repository workflow improperly used the pull_request_target event trigger, which allowed for untrusted code from a forked pull request to be executed in a privileged context. An attacker could create a pull request containing a malicious preinstall script in the package.json file and then trigger the vulnerable workflow by posting a specific comment (!canary). This allowed for arbitrary code execution, leading to the exfiltration of sensitive secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN and NPM_TOKEN, and could have allowed an attacker to push malicious code to the repository or publish compromised packages to the NPM registry. There is a remediation commit which removes github/workflows/release-canary.yml, but a version with this fix has yet to be released."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/security/advisories/GHSA-588g-38p4-gr6x", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/security/advisories/GHSA-588g-38p4-gr6x"}, {"name": "https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/commit/9e1c9c61d742c435ac5e0901b7e0c9249b9fc70c", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/callstackincubator/react-native-bottom-tabs/commit/9e1c9c61d742c435ac5e0901b7e0c9249b9fc70c"}, {"name": "https://callstack.notion.site/Post-Incident-Security-Measures-GitHub-Actions-Workflow-Vulnerability-2405d027c0f8804ab7f7cdfb43366a31", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://callstack.notion.site/Post-Incident-Security-Measures-GitHub-Actions-Workflow-Vulnerability-2405d027c0f8804ab7f7cdfb43366a31"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-269"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-94"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
