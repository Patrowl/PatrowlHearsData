Prior to version 4.13.5, Dependency-Track may send credentials meant for a private NuGet repository to `api.nuget.org` via the HTTP `Authorization` header, and may disclose names and versions of components marked as internal to `api.nuget.org`. This can happen if the Dependency-Track instance contains .NET components, a custom NuGet repository has been configured, the custom repository has been configured with authentication credentials, and the repository server does not provide `PackageBaseAddress` resource in its service index. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.13.5. Some workarounds are avaialble. Disable custom NuGet repositories until the patch has been applied, invalidate the previously used credentials, and generate new credentials for usage after the patch has been applied."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/releases/tag/4.13.5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-83g2-vgqh-mgxc", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-522"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 4.7, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
