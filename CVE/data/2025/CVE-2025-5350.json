This feature accepted user-supplied URLs without proper validation, leading to server-side request forgery (SSRF). Additionally, the retrieved content was directly reflected in the HTTP response, enabling reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) in the admin user's browser context.\n\nBy tricking an administrator into accessing a crafted link, an attacker could force the server to fetch malicious content and reflect it into the admin\u2019s browser, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution for UI manipulation or data exfiltration. While session cookies are protected with the HttpOnly flag, the XSS still poses a significant security risk.\n\nFurthermore, SSRF can be used by a privileged user to query internal services, potentially aiding in internal network enumeration if the target endpoints are reachable from the affected product."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://security.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/security-announcements/security-advisories/2025/WSO2-2025-4124/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-918"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.7, "impactScore": 3.7, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
