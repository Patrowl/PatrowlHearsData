This locking\nappears to be leftover from before conn_hash started using RCU\ncommit bf4c63252490b (\"Bluetooth: convert conn hash to RCU\")\nand not clear if it had purpose since then.\n\nCurrently, there are code paths that delete hci_conn* from elsewhere\nthan the ordered hdev->workqueue where the RX work runs in. E.g.\ncommit 5af1f84ed13a (\"Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix UAF on hci_abort_conn_sync\")\nintroduced some of these, and there probably were a few others before\nit.  It's better to do the locking so that even if these run\nconcurrently no UAF is possible.\n\nMove the lookup of hci_conn and associated socket-specific conn to\nprotocol recv handlers, and do them within a single critical section\nto cover hci_conn* usage and lookup.\n\nsyzkaller has reported a crash that appears to be this issue:\n\n    [Task hdev->workqueue]          [Task 2]\n                                    hci_disconnect_all_sync\n    l2cap_recv_acldata(hcon)\n                                      hci_conn_get(hcon)\n                                      hci_abort_conn_sync(hcon)\n                                        hci_dev_lock\n      hci_dev_lock\n                                        hci_conn_del(hcon)\n      v-------------------------------- hci_dev_unlock\n                                      hci_conn_put(hcon)\n      conn = hcon->l2cap_data (UAF)"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/79a2d4678ba90bdba577dc3af88cc900d6dcd5ee", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ec74cdf77310c43b01b83ee898a9bd4b4b0b8e93", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
