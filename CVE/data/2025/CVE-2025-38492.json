At the end of the issuing function we set NETFS_RREQ_ALL_QUEUED\nto indicate to the collector that we aren't going to issue any more subreqs\nand that it can do the final notifications and cleanup.\n\nNow, this isn't a problem if the request is synchronous\n(NETFS_RREQ_OFFLOAD_COLLECTION is unset) as the result collection will be\ndone in-thread and we're guaranteed an opportunity to run the collector.\n\nHowever, if the request is asynchronous, collection is primarily triggered\nby the termination of subrequests queuing it on a workqueue.  Now, a race\ncan occur here if the app thread sets ALL_QUEUED after the last subrequest\nterminates.\n\nThis can happen most easily with the copy2cache code (as used by Ceph)\nwhere, in the collection routine of a read request, an asynchronous write\nrequest is spawned to copy data to the cache.  Folios are added to the\nwrite request as they're unlocked, but there may be a delay before\nALL_QUEUED is set as the write subrequests may complete before we get\nthere.\n\nIf all the write subreqs have finished by the ALL_QUEUED point, no further\nevents happen and the collection never happens, leaving the request\nhanging.\n\nFix this by queuing the collector after setting ALL_QUEUED.  This is a bit\nheavy-handed and it may be sufficient to do it only if there are no extant\nsubreqs.\n\nAlso add a tracepoint to cross-reference both requests in a copy-to-request\noperation and add a trace to the netfs_rreq tracepoint to indicate the\nsetting of ALL_QUEUED."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/110188a13c4853bd4c342e600ced4dfd26c3feb5"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/89635eae076cd8eaa5cb752f66538c9dc6c9fdc3"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:110188a13c4853bd4c342e600ced4dfd26c3feb5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.15.*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:89635eae076cd8eaa5cb752f66538c9dc6c9fdc3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
