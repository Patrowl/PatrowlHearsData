This permits malicious third-party websites to perform authenticated cross-origin requests against the Eramba API, including endpoints like /system-api/login and /system-api/user/me. The response includes sensitive user session data (ID, name, email, access groups), which is accessible to the attacker's JavaScript. This flaw enables full session hijack and data exfiltration without user interaction. Eramba versions 3.23.3 and earlier were tested and appear unaffected. The vulnerability is present in default installations, requiring no custom configuration."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "http://eramba.com", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://discussions.eramba.org/t/release-3-28-0/7860", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
