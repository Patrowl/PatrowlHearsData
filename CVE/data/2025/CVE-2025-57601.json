When an administrator initiates \"Open Remote Terminal\" from the AiKaan dashboard, the controller sends this same static private key to the target device. The device then uses it to establish a reverse SSH tunnel to a remote access server, enabling browser-based SSH access for the administrator. Because the same `proxyuser` account and SSH key are reused across all customer environments: - An attacker who obtains the key (e.g., by intercepting it in transit, extracting it from the remote access server, or from a compromised admin account) can impersonate any managed device. - They can establish unauthorized reverse SSH tunnels and interact with devices without the owner's consent. This is a design flaw in the authentication model: compromise of a single key compromises the trust boundary between the controller and devices."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/Shubhangborkar/aikaan-vulnerabilities/blob/main/cve1-shared-ssh-key.md", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/Shubhangborkar/aikaan-vulnerabilities/blob/main/cve1-shared-ssh-key.md", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-798"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
