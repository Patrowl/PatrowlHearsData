As `key` is incremented, it remains non-NULL\n> (until it runs into unmapped memory), so the loop does not terminate on\n> valid C strings and will walk memory indefinitely, consuming CPU or hanging\n> the thread.\n\nI easily reproduced this with setfattr and getfattr, causing a kernel\noops, hung user processes and corrupted orangefs files. Disclosure\nsent along a diff (not a patch) with a suggested fix, which I based\nthis patch on.\n\nAfter xattr_key started working right, xfstest generic/069 exposed an\nxattr related memory leak that lead to OOM. xattr_key returns\na hashed key.  When adding xattrs to the orangefs xattr cache, orangefs\nused hash_add, a kernel hashing macro. hash_add also hashes the key using\nhash_log which resulted in additions to the xattr cache going to the wrong\nhash bucket. generic/069 tortures a single file and orangefs does a\ngetattr for the xattr \"security.capability\" every time. Orangefs\nnegative caches on xattrs which includes a kmalloc. Since adds to the\nxattr cache were going to the wrong bucket, every getattr for\n\"security.capability\" resulted in another kmalloc, none of which were\never freed.\n\nI changed the two uses of hash_add to hlist_add_head instead\nand the memory leak ceased and generic/069 quit throwing furniture."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/025e880759c279ec64d0f754fe65bf45961da864", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/15afebb9597449c444801d1ff0b8d8b311f950ab", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9127d1e90c90e5960c8bc72a4ce2c209691a7021", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bc812574de633cf9a9ad6974490e45f6a4bb5126", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c2ca015ac109fd743fdde27933d59dc5ad46658e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6564ff6b53c9a8dc786b6f1c51ae7688273f931", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e09a096104fc65859422817fb2211f35855983fe", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef892d2bf4f3fa2c8de1677dd307e678bdd3d865", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
