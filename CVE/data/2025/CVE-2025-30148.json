Prior to 5.3.23, bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could send a specifically crafted encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The payload would be sanitized on the client-side, but server-side sanitization doesn't catch it. The server-side sanitization logic has been updated to sanitize against this attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.3.23."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-rhx4-hvx9-j387", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/security/advisories/GHSA-rhx4-hvx9-j387"}, {"name": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/commit/e99cfd62d160d145a76fcf9631e6b11226e42358", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/commit/e99cfd62d160d145a76fcf9631e6b11226e42358"}, {"name": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2025-30148", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/cve-2025-30148"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
