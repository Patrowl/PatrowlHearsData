However, if the network interface was\nnot previously enabled, the `priv->wq` (workqueue) is not allocated and\ninitialized, leading to a null pointer dereference.\n\nTo fix this, we move the allocation and initialization of the workqueue\nfrom the `hi3110_open` function to the `hi3110_can_probe` function.\nThis ensures that the workqueue is properly initialized before it is\nused during device resume. And added logic to destroy the workqueue\nin the error handling paths of `hi3110_can_probe` and in the\n`hi3110_can_remove` function to prevent resource leaks."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d2ef21f02baff0c109ad78b9e835fb4acb14533", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b696808472197b77b888f50bc789a3bae077743", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1fc4c041459e2d4856c1b2501486ba4f0cbf96b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e93af787187e585933570563c643337fa731584a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fd00cf38fd437c979f0e5905e3ebdfc3f55a4b96", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
