The loss recovery logic for path probe packets that was added in the v0.50.0 release can be used to trigger a nil-pointer dereference by a malicious QUIC client. In order to do so, the attacker first sends valid QUIC packets from different remote addresses (thereby triggering the newly added path validation logic: the server sends path probe packets), and then sending ACKs for packets received from the server specifically crafted to trigger the nil-pointer dereference. v0.50.1 contains a patch that fixes the vulnerability. This release contains a test that generates random sequences of sent packets (both regular and path probe packets), that was used to verify that the patch actually covers all corner cases. No known workarounds are available."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j972-j939-p2v3", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/security/advisories/GHSA-j972-j939-p2v3"}, {"name": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/4981", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/issues/4981"}, {"name": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b90058aba5f65f48e0e150c89bbaa21a72dda4de", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/commit/b90058aba5f65f48e0e150c89bbaa21a72dda4de"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-248"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
