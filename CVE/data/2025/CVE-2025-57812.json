In CUPS-Filters versions up to and including 1.28.17 and libscupsfilters versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.1, CUPS-Filters's `imagetoraster` filter has an out of bounds read/write vulnerability in the processing of TIFF image files.  While the pixel buffer is allocated with the number of pixels times a pre-calculated bytes-per-pixel value, the function which processes these pixels is called with a size of the number of pixels times 3.  When suitable inputs are passed, the bytes-per-pixel value can be set to 1 and bytes outside of the buffer bounds get processed. In order to trigger the bug, an attacker must issue a print job with a crafted TIFF file, and pass appropriate print job options to control the bytes-per-pixel value of the output format. They must choose a printer configuration under which the `imagetoraster` filter or its C-function equivalent `cfFilterImageToRaster()` gets invoked. The vulnerability exists in both CUPS-Filters 1.x and the successor library libcupsfilters (CUPS-Filters 2.x). In CUPS-Filters 2.x, the vulnerable function is `_cfImageReadTIFF() in libcupsfilters`. When this function is invoked as part of `cfFilterImageToRaster()`, the caller passes a look-up-table during whose processing the out of bounds memory access happens. In CUPS-Filters 1.x, the equivalent functions are all found in the cups-filters repository, which is not split into subprojects yet, and the vulnerable code is in `_cupsImageReadTIFF()`, which is called through `cupsImageOpen()` from the `imagetoraster` tool. A patch is available in commit b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/blob/3c58463e341b12c9d30d7d3807d2bac1bc595a78/cupsfilters/image-tiff.c#L34", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Product"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups-filters/blob/3c58463e341b12c9d30d7d3807d2bac1bc595a78/filter/imagetoraster.c#L613", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Product"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/blob/33421982e10f6a14bc0bab03b80c9cf4660e8d7d/cupsfilters/image-tiff.c#L32", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Product"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/commit/b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/OpenPrinting/libcupsfilters/security/advisories/GHSA-jpxg-qc2c-hgv4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/11/12/1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-125"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-787"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 2.5, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:openprinting:cups-filters:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "42C7C112-8589-4446-9913-BE797ECE4EC7", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "1.28.17"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:openprinting:libcupsfilters:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "4EA9B74A-E657-47C1-9E51-C028FF6656EF", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "2.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "2.1.1"}]}]}}
