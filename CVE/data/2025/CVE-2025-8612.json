This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of AOMEI Backupper Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction on the part of an administrator is needed additionally.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the restore functionality. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the service to create arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
