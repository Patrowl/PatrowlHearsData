However, if mwq->work_q is already running, the\ncancel_delayed_work() may fail to cancel it. This can lead to\nuse-after-free scenarios where mvs_free() frees the mvs_info while\nmvs_work_queue() is still executing and attempts to access the\nalready-freed mvs_info.\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (remove)            | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\nmvs_pci_remove()          |\n  mvs_free()              | mvs_work_queue()\n    cancel_delayed_work() |\n      kfree(mvi)          |\n                          |   mvi-> // UAF\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the delayed work item is properly canceled and any executing\ndelayed work item completes before the mvs_info is deallocated.\n\nThis bug was found by static analysis."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/60cd16a3b7439ccb699d0bf533799eeb894fd217", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
