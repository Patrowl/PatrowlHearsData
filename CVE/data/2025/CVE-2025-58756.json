In versions up to and including 1.5.0, in `model_dict = torch.load(full_path, map_location=torch.device(device), weights_only=True)` in monai/bundle/scripts.py , `weights_only=True` is loaded securely. However, insecure loading methods still exist elsewhere in the project, such as when loading checkpoints. This is a common practice when users want to reduce training time and costs by loading pre-trained models downloaded from other platforms. Loading a checkpoint containing malicious content can trigger a deserialization vulnerability, leading to code execution. As of time of publication, no known fixed versions are available."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/security/advisories/GHSA-6vm5-6jv9-rjpj", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-502"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
