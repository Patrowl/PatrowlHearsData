Before commit 3f61e79, a critical severity vulnerability has been identified within the .github/workflows/benchmark-bot.yml workflow, where a issue_comment can be triggered using the @benchmark body. This workflow is susceptible to exploitation as it checkout the ${{ github.event.issue.number }}, which correspond to the branch of the PR manipulated by potentially malicious actors, and where untrusted code may be executed. Running untrusted code may lead to the exfiltration of GITHUB_TOKEN, which in this workflow has write permissions on most of the scopes - in particular the contents one - and could lead to potential repository takeover. This is fixed by commit 3f61e79."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/security/advisories/GHSA-wrg3-xqw8-m85p", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/security/advisories/GHSA-wrg3-xqw8-m85p"}, {"name": "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/commit/3f61e79102910bd355e920a2df7e44c14c9cb247", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe/commit/3f61e79102910bd355e920a2df7e44c14c9cb247"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-78"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
