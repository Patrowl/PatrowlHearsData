I've dug\ninto it a little, but I haven't been able to root-cause it yet.\nHowever, I bisected to commit 48aab1606fa8 (\"NFSD: Remove the cap on\nnumber of operations per NFSv4 COMPOUND\").\n\nTianshuo Han also reports a potential vulnerability when decoding\nan NFSv4 COMPOUND. An attacker can place an arbitrarily large op\ncount in the COMPOUND header, which results in:\n\n[   51.410584] nfsd: vmalloc error: size 1209533382144, exceeds total\npages, mode:0xdc0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO),\nnodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0\n\nwhen NFSD attempts to allocate the COMPOUND op array.\n\nLet's restore the operation-per-COMPOUND limit, but increased to 200\nfor now."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e7f011c255582d7c914133785bbba1990441713", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b3ee7ce432289deac87b9d14e01f2fe6958f7f0b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
