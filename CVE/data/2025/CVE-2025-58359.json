In versions 2.0.0 through 2.1.0, refresh shares with smaller min_signers will reduce security of group. The inability to change min_signers (i.e. the threshold) with the refresh share functionality (frost_core::keys::refresh module) was not made clear to users. Using a smaller value would not decrease the threshold, and attempts to sign using a smaller threshold would fail. Additionally, after refreshing the shares with a smaller threshold, it would still be possible to sign with the original threshold, potentially causing a security loss to the participant's shares. This issue is fixed in version 2.2.0."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/security/advisories/GHSA-wgq8-vr6r-mqxm", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/security/advisories/GHSA-wgq8-vr6r-mqxm"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/379ef689c733b3d9c80fd409071d4f3af4dafed2", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/379ef689c733b3d9c80fd409071d4f3af4dafed2"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/releases/tag/frost-core%2Fv2.2.0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/releases/tag/frost-core%2Fv2.2.0"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-325"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
