This also implicitly disables the handling of\nsoftirqs such as TIMER_SOFTIRQ.\nOn PREEMPT_RT softirqs are preemptible and spin_lock_irq() does not\ndisable them. That means a timer can be invoked during spin_lock_irq()\non the same CPU. Due to synchronisations reasons local_bh_disable() has\na per-CPU lock named softirq_ctrl.lock which synchronizes individual\nsoftirq against each other.\nsyz-bot managed to trigger a lockdep report where softirq_ctrl.lock is\nacquired in hrtimer_cancel() in addition to hrtimer_run_softirq(). This\nis a possible deadlock.\n\nThe softirq_ctrl.lock can not be made part of spin_lock_irq() as this\nwould lead to too much synchronisation against individual threads on the\nsystem.
