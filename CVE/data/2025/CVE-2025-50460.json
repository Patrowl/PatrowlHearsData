If an attacker can control the content of the YAML configuration file passed to the --run_config parameter, arbitrary code can be executed during deserialization. This can lead to full system compromise. The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious YAML file is loaded, allowing the execution of arbitrary Python commands such as os.system(). It is recommended to upgrade PyYAML to version 5.4 or higher, and to use yaml.safe_load() to mitigate the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift"}, {"url": "https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/blob/main/tests/run.py#L420"}, {"url": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6757-jp84-gxfx"}, {"url": "https://github.com/Anchor0221/CVE-2025-50460"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
