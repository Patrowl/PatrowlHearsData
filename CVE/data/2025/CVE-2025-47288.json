Prior to version 0.1.1, if there was a policy posted to a public topic that was tied to a private group then the group members could be shown to non-group members. This issue has been patched in version 0.1.1. A workaround involves moving any policy topics with private groups to restricted categories."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/security/advisories/GHSA-jc5r-rm2j-mh4x", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/security/advisories/GHSA-jc5r-rm2j-mh4x"}, {"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/commit/6b4390fe486408cc86ccea6b091406cfac6c5b8f", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse-policy/commit/6b4390fe486408cc86ccea6b091406cfac6c5b8f"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-200"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
