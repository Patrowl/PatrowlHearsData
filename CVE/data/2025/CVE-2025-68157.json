From version 5.49.0 to before 5.104.0, when experiments.buildHttp is enabled, webpack\u2019s HTTP(S) resolver (HttpUriPlugin) enforces allowedUris only for the initial URL, but does not re-validate allowedUris after following HTTP 30x redirects. As a result, an import that appears restricted to a trusted allow-list can be redirected to HTTP(S) URLs outside the allow-list. This is a policy/allow-list bypass that enables build-time SSRF behavior (requests from the build machine to internal-only endpoints, depending on network access) and untrusted content inclusion in build outputs (redirected content is treated as module source and bundled). This issue has been patched in version 5.104.0."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack/security/advisories/GHSA-38r7-794h-5758", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-918"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 2.5, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:webpack.js:webpack:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "ADA354B0-6A76-4EF0-B94E-51DA67B927C1", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "5.49.0", "versionEndExcluding": "5.104.0"}]}]}}
