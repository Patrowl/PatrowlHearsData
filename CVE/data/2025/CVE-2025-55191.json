Versions between 2.1.0 and 2.14.19, 3.2.0-rc1, 3.1.0-rc1 through 3.1.7, and 3.0.0-rc1 through 3.0.18 contain a race condition in the repository credentials handler that can cause the Argo CD server to panic and crash when concurrent operations are performed on the same repository URL. The vulnerability is located in numerous repository related handlers in the util/db/repository_secrets.go file. A valid API token with repositories resource permissions (create, update, or delete actions) is required to trigger the race condition. This vulnerability causes the entire Argo CD server to crash and become unavailable. Attackers can repeatedly and continuously trigger the race condition to maintain a denial-of-service state, disrupting all GitOps operations. This issue is fixed in versions 2.14.20, 3.2.0-rc2, 3.1.8 and 3.0.19."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/701bc50d01c752cad96185f848088d287a97c7b7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/6103", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-g88p-r42r-ppp9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-362"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
