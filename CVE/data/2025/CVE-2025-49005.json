In Next.js App Router from 15.3.0 to before 15.3.3 and Vercel CLI from 41.4.1 to 42.2.0, a cache poisoning vulnerability was found. The issue allowed page requests for HTML content to return a React Server Component (RSC) payload instead under certain conditions. When deployed to Vercel, this would only impact the browser cache, and would not lead to the CDN being poisoned. When self-hosted and deployed externally, this could lead to cache poisoning if the CDN does not properly distinguish between RSC / HTML in the cache keys. This issue has been resolved in Next.js 15.3.3."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-r2fc-ccr8-96c4", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-r2fc-ccr8-96c4"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/79346", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/79346"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/ec202eccf05820b60c6126d6411fe16766ecc066", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/commit/ec202eccf05820b60c6126d6411fe16766ecc066"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v15.3.3", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v15.3.3"}, {"name": "https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-49005", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://vercel.com/changelog/cve-2025-49005"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-444"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
