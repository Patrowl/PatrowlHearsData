This means that\ncallbacks could run on behalf of unauthorized callers while the\nsyscall still returned failure to user space.\n\nFix this by only invoking bind() after \"if (ret) break;\" check\ni.e. after permission checks have succeeded."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1dbfb0363224f6da56f6655d596dc5097308d6f5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8858c1e9405906c09589d7c336f04058ea198207", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/98c9d884047a3051c203708914a874dece3cbe54", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
