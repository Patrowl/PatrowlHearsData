An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content to an affected device and using the device to generate a document that contains sensitive information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the standard layout of the device-generated documents, read arbitrary files from the underlying operating system, and conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Security Analyst (Read Only)."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-html-inj-MqjrZrny", "name": "cisco-sa-fmc-html-inj-MqjrZrny"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_1", "cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
