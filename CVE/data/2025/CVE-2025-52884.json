The risc0-ethereum repository contains Solidity verifier contracts, Steel EVM view call library, and supporting code. Prior to versions 2.1.1 and 2.2.0, the `Steel.validateCommitment` Solidity library function will return `true` for a crafted commitment with a digest value of zero. This violates the semantics of `validateCommitment`, as this does not commitment to a block that is in the current chain. Because the digest is zero, it does not correspond to any block and there exist no known openings. As a result, this commitment will never be produced by a correct zkVM guest using Steel and leveraging this bug to compromise the soundness of a program using Steel would require a separate bug or misuse of the Steel library, which is expected to be used to validate the root of state opening proofs. A fix has been released as part of `risc0-ethereum` 2.1.1 and 2.2.0. Users for the `Steel` Solidity library versions 2.1.0 or earlier should ensure they are using `Steel.validateCommitment` in tandem with zkVM proof verification of a Steel program, as shown in the ERC-20 counter example, and documentation. This is the correct usage of Steel, and users following this pattern are not at risk, and do not need to take action. Users not verifying a zkVM proof of a Steel program should update their application to do so, as this is incorrect usage of Steel."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-gjv3-89hh-9xq2", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/security/advisories/GHSA-gjv3-89hh-9xq2"}, {"name": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/pull/605", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/pull/605"}, {"name": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/commit/3bbac859c7132b21ba5fdf2d47f1dd52e7e73d98", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/commit/3bbac859c7132b21ba5fdf2d47f1dd52e7e73d98"}, {"name": "https://docs.beboundless.xyz/developers/steel/how-it-works#verifying-the-proof-onchain", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://docs.beboundless.xyz/developers/steel/how-it-works#verifying-the-proof-onchain"}, {"name": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/blob/ff0cb9253a87945b653b825711b8b5075f8b7545/examples/erc20-counter/contracts/src/Counter.sol#L56-L63", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/blob/ff0cb9253a87945b653b825711b8b5075f8b7545/examples/erc20-counter/contracts/src/Counter.sol#L56-L63"}, {"name": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.1.1", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.1.1"}, {"name": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.2.0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/risc0/risc0-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.2.0"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-159"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "LOW", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 1.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
