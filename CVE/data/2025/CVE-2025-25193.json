An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crash. A similar issue was previously reported as CVE-2024-47535. This issue was fixed, but the fix was incomplete in that null-bytes were not counted against the input limit. Commit d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386 contains an updated fix."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-839f-4rhx", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-389x-839f-4rhx"}, {"name": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/d1fbda62d3a47835d3fb35db8bd42ecc205a5386"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-400"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
