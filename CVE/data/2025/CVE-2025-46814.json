An HTTP header injection vulnerability has been identified in versions prior to 2.0.0. By manipulating the X-Forwarded-For header, an attacker can potentially inject arbitrary IP addresses into the request. This vulnerability can allow attackers to bypass IP-based access controls, mislead logging systems, and impersonate trusted clients. It is especially impactful when the application relies on the X-Forwarded-For header for IP-based authorization or authentication. Users should upgrade to FastAPI Guard version 2.0.0 to receive a fix."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/security/advisories/GHSA-77q8-qmj7-x7pp", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/security/advisories/GHSA-77q8-qmj7-x7pp"}, {"name": "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/commit/0b003fda4c678c1b514e95f319aee88113e9bf4b", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/rennf93/fastapi-guard/commit/0b003fda4c678c1b514e95f319aee88113e9bf4b"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-74"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.4, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
