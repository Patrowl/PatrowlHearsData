This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include arbitrary file paths in a form submission. The file will be deleted when the form submission is deleted, whether by an Administrator or via auto-deletion determined by plugin settings. This can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php)."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/6dc9b4cb-d36b-4693-a7b9-1dad123b6639?source=cve"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/forminator/trunk/library/model/class-form-entry-model.php#L1249"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3319860/forminator#file3"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-73"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:wpmudev:forminator forms \u2013 contact form, payment form & custom form builder:1.44.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
