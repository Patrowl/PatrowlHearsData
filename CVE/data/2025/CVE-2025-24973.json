Prior to version 12.25Q1.1, due to an improper implementation of the logout process, authentication credentials remain in cookies even after a user has explicitly logged out, which may allow an attacker to steal authentication tokens. This could have devastating consequences if a user with admin privileges is (or was) using a shared device. Users who have logged in on a shared device should go to Settings > Security and regenerate their login tokens. Version 12.25Q1.1 fixes the issue. As a workaround, clear cookies and site data in the browser after logging out."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/nexryai/concorde/security/advisories/GHSA-2369-p2wh-7cc2", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/nexryai/concorde/security/advisories/GHSA-2369-p2wh-7cc2"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nexryai/concorde/commit/1f6ac9b289906083b132e4f9667a31a60ef83e4e", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nexryai/concorde/commit/1f6ac9b289906083b132e4f9667a31a60ef83e4e"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-613"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.4, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
