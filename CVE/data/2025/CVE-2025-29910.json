A memory leak vulnerability was identified in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability can lead to resource exhaustion and degraded system performance over time, particularly in long-running processes or systems processing large volumes of data. The vulnerability is present in the `crypto_handle_incrementing_nontransmitted_counter` function within `crypto_tc.c`. The function allocates memory using `malloc` without ensuring the allocated memory is always freed. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, reduced system performance, and potentially a Denial of Service (DoS) in environments where CryptoLib is used in long-running processes or with large volumes of data. Any system using CryptoLib, especially those handling high-throughput or continuous data streams, could be impacted. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/security/advisories/GHSA-p38w-p2r8-g6g5"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-401"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "LOW", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
