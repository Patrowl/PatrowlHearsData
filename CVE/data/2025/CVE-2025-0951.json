This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to deactivate all of a site's plugins. While we escalated this to Envato after not being able to establish contact, it appears the developer added a nonce check, however that is not sufficient protection as the nonce is exposed to all users with access to the dashboard."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/0099c700-e1af-4d97-a518-151a9139ea35?source=cve"}, {"url": "https://themeforest.net/user/liquidthemes"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-862"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
