Versions up to and including 4.4.5 are vulnerable to any end-user crafting a DOM based XSS on all of YesWiki's pages which is triggered when a user clicks on a malicious link. The vulnerability makes use of the search by tag feature. When a tag doesn't exist, the tag is reflected on the page and isn't properly sanitized on the server side which allows a malicious user to generate a link that will trigger an XSS on the client's side when clicked. This vulnerability allows any user to generate a malicious link that will trigger an account takeover when clicked, therefore allowing a user to steal other accounts, modify pages, comments, permissions, extract user data (emails), thus impacting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of a YesWiki instance. Version 4.5.0 contains a patch for the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/security/advisories/GHSA-wphc-5f2j-jhvg"}, {"name": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/YesWiki/yeswiki/commit/c1e28b59394957902c31c850219e4504a20db98b"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
