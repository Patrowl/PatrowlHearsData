It may cause denial-of-service. In fec_read_bufs, there is a loop that\nhas 253 iterations. For each iteration, we may call verity_hash_for_block\nrecursively. There is a limit of 4 nested recursions - that means that\nthere may be at most 253^4 (4 billion) iterations. Red Hat QE team\nactually created an image that pushes dm-verity to this limit - and this\nimage just makes the udev-worker process get stuck in the 'D' state.\n\n2. It doesn't work. In fec_read_bufs we store data into the variable\n\"fio->bufs\", but fio bufs is shared between recursive invocations, if\n\"verity_hash_for_block\" invoked correction recursively, it would\noverwrite partially filled fio->bufs."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/232948cf600fba69aff36b25d85ef91a73a35756", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d9f3e47d3fae0c101d9094bc956ed24e7a0ee801", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
