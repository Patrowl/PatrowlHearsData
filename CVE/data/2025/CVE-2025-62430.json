ClipBucket v5 through build 5.5.2 #145 allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in multiple video and photo metadata fields. For videos the Tags field and the Genre, Actors, Producer, Executive Producer, and Director fields in Movieinfos accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. For photos the Photo Title and Photo Tags fields accept user supplied values without adequate sanitization. A regular user who can edit a video or photo can inject script (for example by supplying a value such as a closing delimiter followed by a script element). The injected script executes when any user, including an unauthenticated visitor or an administrator, views the affected video or photo page. Although cookies are set with the HttpOnly attribute and cannot be read directly, the injected script can issue fetch requests to endpoints such as admin_area pages and exfiltrate their contents or trigger unintended actions. Version 5.5.2 build #146 and later contain a fix. Update to build 5.5.2 #146 or later. No known workarounds exist."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/commit/8e3cf79ce2721fbebde68a05a9a1a6319f086bcc", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/MacWarrior/clipbucket-v5/security/advisories/GHSA-qrqq-hpf3-9mc9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Vendor Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.3, "impactScore": 2.7, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:oxygenz:clipbucket:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "38E8AAC6-11F4-4017-BDFC-558678EBEADF", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "5.5.2-146"}]}]}}
