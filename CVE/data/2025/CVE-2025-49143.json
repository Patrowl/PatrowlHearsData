Prior to v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 , files uploaded by users to Nautobot's MEDIA_ROOT directory, including DeviceType image attachments as well as images attached to a Location, Device, or Rack, are served to users via a URL endpoint that was not enforcing user authentication. As a consequence, such files can be retrieved by anonymous users who know or can guess the correct URL for a given file. Nautobot v2.4.10 and v1.6.32 address this issue by adding enforcement of Nautobot user authentication to this endpoint."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-rh67-4c8j-hjjh", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/security/advisories/GHSA-rh67-4c8j-hjjh"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/6672", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/6672"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/6703", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/6703"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/9c892dc300429948a4714f743c9c2879d8987340", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/9c892dc300429948a4714f743c9c2879d8987340"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/d99a53b065129cff3a0fa9abe7355a9ef1ad4c95", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/commit/d99a53b065129cff3a0fa9abe7355a9ef1ad4c95"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-200"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "LOW", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "LOW", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
