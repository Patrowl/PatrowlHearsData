Prior to version 2.69.1, the Fides Admin UI login endpoint relies on a general IP-based rate limit for all API traffic and lacks specific anti-automation controls designed to protect against brute-force attacks. This could allow attackers to conduct credential testing attacks, such as credential stuffing or password spraying, which poses a risk to accounts with weak or previously compromised passwords. Version 2.69.1 fixes the issue. For organizations with commercial Fides Enterprise licenses, configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) through an OIDC provider (like Azure, Google, or Okta) is an effective workaround. When OIDC SSO is enabled, username/password authentication can be disabled entirely, which eliminates this attack vector. This functionality is not available for Fides Open Source users."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-7q62-r88r-j5gw", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/security/advisories/GHSA-7q62-r88r-j5gw"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/59903c195e2f9f8915a1db94950aefd557033a5c", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/commit/59903c195e2f9f8915a1db94950aefd557033a5c"}, {"name": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.69.1", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/ethyca/fides/releases/tag/2.69.1"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-307"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "LOW", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 1.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
