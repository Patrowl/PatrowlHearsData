Most\nnotably the timeline name can get freed if userspace closes the associated\nsubmit queue. At the same time the fence could have been exported to a\nthird party (for example a sync_fence fd) which will then cause an use-\nafter-free on subsequent access.\n\nTo make this safe we need to make the driver compliant with the newly\ndocumented dma-fence rules. Driver has to ensure a RCU grace period\nbetween signalling a fence and freeing any data pointed to by said fence.\n\nFor the timeline name we simply make the queue be freed via kfree_rcu and\nfor the shared lock associated with multiple queues we add a RCU grace\nperiod before freeing the per GT structure holding the lock."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/683b0e397dad9f26a42dcacf6f7f545a77ce6c06", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6bd90e700b4285e6a7541e00f969cab0d696adde", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b17fcce70733c211cb5dabf54f4f9491920b1d92", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba37807d08bae67de6139346a85650cab5f6145a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
