When using end-to-end encryption, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with JavaScript code embedded in the filename. After upload and every time someone opens the upload list, the script is then parsed. Prior to version 2.0.0, there was no user permission system implemented, therefore all authenticated users were already able to see and modify all resources, even if end-to-end encrypted, as the encryption key had to be the same for all users using a version prior to 2.0.0. If a user is the only authenticated user using Gokapi, they are not affected. This issue has been fixed in v2.0.0. A possible workaround would be to disable end-to-end encryption."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/security/advisories/GHSA-95rc-wc32-gm53", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/security/advisories/GHSA-95rc-wc32-gm53"}, {"name": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/commit/343cc566cfd7f4efcd522c92371561d494aed6b0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/commit/343cc566cfd7f4efcd522c92371561d494aed6b0"}, {"name": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/releases/tag/v2.0.0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi/releases/tag/v2.0.0"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-87"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "PASSIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "LOW", "subIntegrityImpact": "LOW", "subAvailabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 4.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:L", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
