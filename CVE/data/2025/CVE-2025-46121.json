A remote attacker can exploit this flaw either by sending a crafted request to the authenticated endpoint `/admin/_conf.jsp`, or without authentication and without direct network access to the controller by spoofing the MAC address of a favourite station and embedding malicious format specifiers in the DHCP hostname field, resulting in unauthenticated format-string processing and arbitrary code execution on the controller."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://support.ruckuswireless.com/security_bulletins/330"}, {"url": "https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2025-07-ruckus-unleashed/"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
