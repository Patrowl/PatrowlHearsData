Prior to version 1.8.178, FreeScout is vulnerable to code injection due to insufficient validation of user input in the php_path parameter. The backticks characters are not removed, as well as tabulation is not removed. When checking user input, the file_exists function is also called to check for the presence of such a file (folder) in the file system. A user with the administrator role can create a translation for the language, which will create a folder in the file system. Further in tools.php, the user can specify the path to this folder as php_path, which will lead to the execution of code in backticks. This issue has been patched in version 1.8.178."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-5324-cw55-gwj5", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-5324-cw55-gwj5"}, {"name": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/fb33d672a2d67f5a2b3cf69c80945267f17908b2", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/freescout-help-desk/freescout/commit/fb33d672a2d67f5a2b3cf69c80945267f17908b2"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-94"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
