When detected in ethtool_get_strings():\n    # ethtool -S eth2\n    no stats available\n\n2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.\n\nBoth cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call\nshould succeed.\n\nOther than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no\noutput/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting\nincorrect/shifted stats.\nI also considered returning an error instead of a \"silent\" response, but\nthat seems more destructive towards userspace apps.\n\nNotes:\n- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure\n  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more\n  predictable behavior.\n\n- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between\n  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.\n\n- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that\n  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications\n  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,\n  to prevent any regressions."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4066b5b546293f44cd6d0e84ece6e3ee7ff27093", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4afcb985355210e1688560dc47e64b94dad35d71", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b07be1ff1cb6c49869910518650e8d0abc7d25f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7bea09f60f2ad5d232e2db8f1c14e850fd3fd416", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca9983bc3a1189bd72f9ae449d925a66b2616326", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
