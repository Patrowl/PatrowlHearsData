The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we\ndon't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up\nleaking the FB tunnel.\n\nThere are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in\nboth net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,\nxfrm_state_migrate). A \"proper\" rollback of the init_state work would\nprobably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets\nmore complicated as multiple states may be involved.\n\nAt some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call\nxfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states\nwill have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,\nwhich solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)\naimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the\nlists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&xfrm_state_gc_work)."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10deb69864840ccf96b00ac2ab3a2055c0c04721", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d6fe5c740c573af10943b8353992e1325cdb2715", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7d879c19d306512c2e260f37e8a3e5c85e37c50", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
