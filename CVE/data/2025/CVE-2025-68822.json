During device detachment, the original implementation\ncalls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure\ncompletion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()\nin psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that\nwere already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any\nwork items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not\nincluded in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.\nThis means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,\nthe dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the\npsmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),\nthe scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)\npsmouse_disconnect()     |\n  psmouse_set_state()    |\n  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()\n  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()\n    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()\n                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE\n                         |   priv->dev3 // USE\n\nAdd disable_delayed_work_sync() in alps_disconnect() to ensure\nthat dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from\nexecuting after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.\n\nThis bug is identified by static analysis."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a9c115e017b2c633d25bdfe6709dda6fc36f08c2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bf40644ef8c8a288742fa45580897ed0e0289474", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed8c61b89be0c45f029228b2913d5cf7b5cda1a7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
