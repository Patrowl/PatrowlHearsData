The subsequent tail-handling code then operates on the original<br>base pointers, effectively reprocessing the beginning of the buffer while<br>leaving the actual trailing bytes unprocessed. The authentication checksum<br>also excludes the true tail bytes.<br><br>However, typical OpenSSL consumers using EVP are not affected because the<br>higher-level EVP and provider OCB implementations split inputs so that full<br>blocks and trailing partial blocks are processed in separate calls, avoiding<br>the problematic code path. Additionally, TLS does not use OCB ciphersuites.<br>The vulnerability only affects applications that call the low-level<br>CRYPTO_ocb128_encrypt() or CRYPTO_ocb128_decrypt() functions directly with<br>non-block-aligned lengths in a single call on hardware-accelerated builds.<br>For these reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.<br><br>The FIPS modules in 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected<br>by this issue, as OCB mode is not a FIPS-approved algorithm.<br><br>OpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.<br><br>OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/372fc5c77529695b05b4f5b5187691a57ef5dffc", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4016975d4469cd6b94927c607f7c511385f928d8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/52d23c86a54adab5ee9f80e48b242b52c4cc2347", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a7589230356d908c0eca4b969ec4f62106f4f5ae", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/ed40856d7d4ba6cb42779b6770666a65f19cb977", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20260127.txt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-325"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
