This leads to use-after-free\nscenarios where tb_tunnel is deallocated by tb_tunnel_put(), while\ntunnel->dprx_work remains active and attempts to dereference tb_tunnel\nin tb_dp_dprx_work().\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0                            | CPU 1\ntb_dp_tunnel_active()            |\n  tb_deactivate_and_free_tunnel()| tb_dp_dprx_start()\n    tb_tunnel_deactivate()       |   queue_delayed_work()\n      tb_dp_activate()           |\n        tb_dp_dprx_stop()        | tb_dp_dprx_work() //delayed worker\n          cancel_delayed_work()  |\n    tb_tunnel_put(tunnel);       |\n                                 |   tunnel = container_of(...); //UAF\n                                 |   tunnel-> //UAF\n\nReplacing cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() is\nnot feasible as it would introduce a deadlock: both tb_dp_dprx_work()\nand the cleanup path acquire tb->lock, and cancel_delayed_work_sync()\nwould wait indefinitely for the work item that cannot proceed.\n\nInstead, implement proper reference counting:\n- If cancel_delayed_work() returns true (work is pending), we release\n  the reference in the stop function.\n- If it returns false (work is executing or already completed), the\n  reference is released in delayed work function itself.\n\nThis ensures the tb_tunnel remains valid during work item execution\nwhile preventing memory leaks.\n\nThis bug was found by static analysis."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/67600ccfc4f38ebd331b9332ac94717bfbc87ea7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c07923f6a8729fc27ee652221a51702ff6654097", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
