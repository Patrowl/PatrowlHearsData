Turns out the assumption does\nnot hold for speculative execution paths. See example in the next\npatch.\n\nmaybe_scc_exit() is called from update_branch_counts() for states that\nreach branch count of zero, meaning that path exploration for a\nparticular path is finished. Path exploration can finish in one of\nthree ways:\na. Verification error is found. In this case, update_branch_counts()\n   is called only for non-speculative paths.\nb. Top level BPF_EXIT is reached. Such instructions are never a part of\n   an SCC, so compute_scc_callchain() in maybe_scc_exit() will return\n   false, and maybe_scc_exit() will return early.\nc. A checkpoint is reached and matched. Checkpoints are created by\n   is_state_visited(), which calls maybe_enter_scc(), which allocates\n   bpf_scc_visit instances for checkpoints within SCCs.\n\nHence, for non-speculative symbolic execution paths, the assumption\nstill holds: if maybe_scc_exit() is called for a state within an SCC,\nbpf_scc_visit instance must exist.\n\nThis patch removes the verifier_bug() call for speculative paths."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3861e7c4324aa20a632fb74eb3904114f6afdb57", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3c73d629ea1373af3c0c954d41fd1af555492e3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
