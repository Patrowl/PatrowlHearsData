Octo-STS versions before v0.5.3 are vulnerable to unauthenticated SSRF by abusing fields in OpenID Connect tokens. Malicious tokens were shown to trigger internal network requests which could reflect error logs with sensitive information. Upgrade to v0.5.3 to resolve this issue. This version includes patch sets to sanitize input and redact logging."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/security/advisories/GHSA-h3qp-hwvr-9xcq", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/security/advisories/GHSA-h3qp-hwvr-9xcq"}, {"name": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/security/advisories/GHSA-h3qp-hwvr-9xcq", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/security/advisories/GHSA-h3qp-hwvr-9xcq"}, {"name": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/commit/0f177fde54f9318e33f0bba6abaea9463a7c3afd", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/commit/0f177fde54f9318e33f0bba6abaea9463a7c3afd"}, {"name": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/commit/b3976e39bd8c8c217c0670747d34a4499043da92", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/octo-sts/app/commit/b3976e39bd8c8c217c0670747d34a4499043da92"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-918"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 8.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
