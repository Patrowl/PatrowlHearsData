OpenFGA versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.12 (corresponding to Helm chart openfga-0.2.16 through openfga-0.2.30 and docker 1.8.0 through 1.8.12) are vulnerable to authorization bypass when certain Check and ListObject calls are executed. Users are affected under four specific conditions: First, calling Check API or ListObjects with an authorization model that has a relationship directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; second, there are check or list object queries with contextual tuples for the relationship that can be directly assignable by both type bound public access and userset; third, those contextual tuples\u2019s user field is an userset; and finally, type bound public access tuples are not assigned to the relationship. Users should upgrade to version 1.8.13 to receive a patch. The upgrade is backwards compatible."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-c72g-53hw-82q7", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-c72g-53hw-82q7"}, {"name": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/e5960d4eba92b723de8ff3a5346a07f50c1379ca", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/openfga/openfga/commit/e5960d4eba92b723de8ff3a5346a07f50c1379ca"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-285"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "subIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "subAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
