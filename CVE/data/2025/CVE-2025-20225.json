An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 packets to an affected device. In the case of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly. In the case of Cisco ASA and FTD Software, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to partially exhaust system memory, causing system instability such as being unable to establish new IKEv2 VPN sessions. A manual reboot of the device is required to recover from this condition."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ios-dos-DOESHWHy", "name": "cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ios-dos-DOESHWHy"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-401"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_1", "cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
