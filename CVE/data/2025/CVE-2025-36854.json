At some point afterward, the memory may be allocated again and saved in another pointer, while the original pointer references a location somewhere within the new allocation. Any operations using the original pointer are no longer valid because the memory \"belongs\" to the code that operates on the new pointer.\n\n  This issue affects EOL ASP.NET\u00a06.0.0 <= 6.0.36 as represented in this CVE, as well as\u00a08.0.0 <= 8.0.8, 9.0.0-preview.1.24081.5 <= 9.0.0.RC.1 as represented in\u00a0 CVE-2024-38229 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord .\n\n  Additionally, if you've deployed  self-contained applications https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd \u00a0targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n   NOTE: This CVE only represents End Of Life (EOL) software components.
