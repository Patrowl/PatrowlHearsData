For Cilium users who use Gateway API for Ingress for some services and use LB-IPAM or BGP for LB Service implementation and use network policies to block egress traffic from workloads in a namespace to workloads in other namespaces, egress traffic from workloads covered by such network policies to LoadBalancers configured by `Gateway` resources will incorrectly be allowed. LoadBalancer resources not deployed via a Gateway API configuration are not affected by this issue. This issue affects: Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.14 inclusive, v1.16 between v1.16.0 and v1.16.7 inclusive, and v1.17 between v1.17.0 and v1.17.1 inclusive. This issue is fixed in Cilium v1.15.15, v1.16.8, and v1.17.2. A Clusterwide Cilium Network Policy can be used to work around this issue for users who are unable to upgrade."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-24qp-4xx8-3jvj", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/cilium/cilium/security/advisories/GHSA-24qp-4xx8-3jvj"}, {"name": "https://github.com/cilium/proxy/pull/1172", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/cilium/proxy/pull/1172"}, {"name": "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/lb-ipam"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-863"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.2, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
