Prior to version 5.2.1, webpack-dev-server users' source code may be stolen when you access a malicious web site with non-Chromium based browser. The `Origin` header is checked to prevent Cross-site WebSocket hijacking from happening, which was reported by CVE-2018-14732. But webpack-dev-server always allows IP address `Origin` headers. This allows websites that are served on IP addresses to connect WebSocket. An attacker can obtain source code via a method similar to that used to exploit CVE-2018-14732. Version 5.2.1 contains a patch for the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/security/advisories/GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h"}, {"name": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/5c9378bb01276357d7af208a0856ca2163db188e", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/5c9378bb01276357d7af208a0856ca2163db188e"}, {"name": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/72efaab83381a0e1c4914adf401cbd210b7de7eb", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/commit/72efaab83381a0e1c4914adf401cbd210b7de7eb"}, {"name": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/55220a800ba4e30dbde2d98785ecf4c80b32f711/lib/Server.js#L3113-L3127", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/blob/55220a800ba4e30dbde2d98785ecf4c80b32f711/lib/Server.js#L3113-L3127"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-346"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
