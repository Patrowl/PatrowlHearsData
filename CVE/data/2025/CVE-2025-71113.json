This resulted in the use of uninitialized\ndata in certain error paths or when new fields are added in the\nfuture.\n\nThe ACVP patches also contain two user-space interface files:\nalgif_kpp.c and algif_akcipher.c. These too rely on proper\ninitialization of their context structures.\n\nA particular issue has been observed with the newly added\n'inflight' variable introduced in af_alg_ctx by commit:\n\n  67b164a871af (\"crypto: af_alg - Disallow multiple in-flight AIO requests\")\n\nBecause the context is not memset to zero after allocation,\nthe inflight variable has contained garbage values. As a result,\naf_alg_alloc_areq() has incorrectly returned -EBUSY randomly when\nthe garbage value was interpreted as true:\n\n  https://github.com/gregkh/linux/blame/master/crypto/af_alg.c#L1209\n\nThe check directly tests ctx->inflight without explicitly\ncomparing against true/false. Since inflight is only ever set to\ntrue or false later, an uninitialized value has triggered\n-EBUSY failures. Zero-initializing memory allocated with\nsock_kmalloc() ensures inflight and other fields start in a known\nstate, removing random issues caused by uninitialized data."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/51a5ab36084f3251ef87eda3e6a6236f6488925e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a4b65523608974a81edbe386f8a667a3e10c726", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6f6e309328d53a10c0fe1f77dec2db73373179b6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/84238876e3b3b262cf62d5f4d1338e983fb27010", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f81244fd6b14fecfa93b66b6bb1d59f96554e550", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
