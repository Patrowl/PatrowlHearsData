Between 30 December 2024 and 4 March 2025 Python JSON Logger was vulnerable to RCE through a missing dependency. This occurred because msgspec-python313-pre was deleted by the owner leaving the name open to being claimed by a third party. If the package was claimed, it would allow them RCE on any Python JSON Logger user who installed the development dependencies on Python 3.13 (e.g. pip install python-json-logger[dev]). This issue has been resolved with 3.3.0."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/security/advisories/GHSA-wmxh-pxcx-9w24", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/security/advisories/GHSA-wmxh-pxcx-9w24"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/2548e3a2e3cedf6bef3ee7c60c55b7c02d1af11a", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/2548e3a2e3cedf6bef3ee7c60c55b7c02d1af11a"}, {"name": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/e7761e56edb980cfab0165e32469d5fd017a5d72", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/nhairs/python-json-logger/commit/e7761e56edb980cfab0165e32469d5fd017a5d72"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-829"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
