This ends up being fairly benign because the\nside effect is just the invalidation of the authorizer and successive\nfetching of new tickets.\n\ncon->v1.connect_seq overlaps with con->v2.conn_bufs and the fact that\nit's being written to can cause more serious consequences, but luckily\nit's not something that happens often."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23538cfbeed87159a5ac6c61e7a6de3d8d4486a8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/35dbbc3dbf8bccb2d77c68444f42c1e6d2d27983", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/591ea9c30737663a471b2bb07b27ddde86b020d5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6bd8b56899be0b514945f639a89ccafb8f8dfaef", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cdbc9836c7afadad68f374791738f118263c5371", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
