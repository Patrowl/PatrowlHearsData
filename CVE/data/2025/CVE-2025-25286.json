Prior to Crayfish version 4.1.0, remote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations. The issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`. Some workarounds are available. The exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus. Alternatively or additionally, configure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/security/advisories/GHSA-mm6v-68qp-f9fw"}, {"name": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/Islandora/Crayfish/commit/64cb4cec688928798cc40e6f0a0e863d7f69fd89"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-150"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-157"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
