Versions starting from 0.5.0 to before 2.2.0, are vulnerable to local logging of sensitive information. When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Connector would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations, and is not logged server-side by Snowflake. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/libsnowflakeclient/security/advisories/GHSA-jx4f-645p-wjpx", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/libsnowflakeclient/security/advisories/GHSA-jx4f-645p-wjpx"}, {"name": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/libsnowflakeclient/commit/3caa8a6a3ee95e0a66ead03b4bf6a2d1ca42ebfe", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/snowflakedb/libsnowflakeclient/commit/3caa8a6a3ee95e0a66ead03b4bf6a2d1ca42ebfe"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-532"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.3, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
