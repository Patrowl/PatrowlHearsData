Starting in version 7.2.0 and prior to version 7.5.2, it is possible to force an application to switch to SPA mode by adding a header to the request. If the application uses SSR and is forced to switch to SPA, this causes an error that completely corrupts the page. If a cache system is in place, this allows the response containing the error to be cached, resulting in a cache poisoning that strongly impacts the availability of the application. This issue has been patched in version 7.5.2."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/security/advisories/GHSA-f46r-rw29-r322"}, {"name": "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/c84302972a152d851cf5dd859ff332b354b70111", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/c84302972a152d851cf5dd859ff332b354b70111"}, {"name": "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/e6c53a0130559b4a9bd47f9cf76ea5b08a69868a/packages/react-router/lib/server-runtime/server.ts#L407", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/e6c53a0130559b4a9bd47f9cf76ea5b08a69868a/packages/react-router/lib/server-runtime/server.ts#L407"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-755"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
