This check is racy against a concurrent exec() in the\ntarget process.\n\nDuring exec(), a task may transition from a non-privileged binary to a\nprivileged one (e.g., setuid binary) and its credentials/memory mappings\nmay change. If get_robust_list() performs ptrace_may_access() before\nthis transition, it may erroneously allow access to sensitive information\nafter the target becomes privileged.\n\nA racy access allows an attacker to exploit a window during which\nptrace_may_access() passes before a target process transitions to a\nprivileged state via exec().\n\nFor example, consider a non-privileged task T that is about to execute a\nsetuid-root binary. An attacker task A calls get_robust_list(T) while T\nis still unprivileged. Since ptrace_may_access() checks permissions\nbased on current credentials, it succeeds. However, if T begins exec\nimmediately afterwards, it becomes privileged and may change its memory\nmappings. Because get_robust_list() proceeds to access T->robust_list\nwithout synchronizing with exec() it may read user-space pointers from a\nnow-privileged process.\n\nThis violates the intended post-exec access restrictions and could\nexpose sensitive memory addresses or be used as a primitive in a larger\nexploit chain. Consequently, the race can lead to unauthorized\ndisclosure of information across privilege boundaries and poses a\npotential security risk.\n\nTake a read lock on signal->exec_update_lock prior to invoking\nptrace_may_access() and accessing the robust_list/compat_robust_list.\nThis ensures that the target task's exec state remains stable during the\ncheck, allowing for consistent and synchronized validation of\ncredentials."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3b4222494489f6d4b8705a496dab03384b7ca998", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4aced32596ead1820b7dbd8e40d30b30dc1f3ad4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6511984d1aa1360181bcafb1ca75df7f291ef237", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b54082c3ed4dc9821cdf0edb17302355cc5bb45", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b524455a51feb6013df3a5dba3160487b2e8e22a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
