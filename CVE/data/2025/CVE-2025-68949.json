From 1.36.0 to before 2.2.0, the Webhook node\u2019s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring. This issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.0."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/commit/11f8597d4ad69ea3b58941573997fdbc4de1fec5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues/23399", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/23399", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-w96v-gf22-crwp", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-134"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-284"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
