This prevents client-side race conditions\nwhere concurrent operations (e.g. rename) cause r_parent to become stale\nbetween request initiation and reply processing, which could lead to\napplying state changes to incorrect directory inodes.\n\n[ idryomov: folded a kerneldoc fixup and a follow-up fix from Alex to\n  move CEPH_CAP_PIN reference when r_parent is updated:\n\n  When the parent directory lock is not held, req->r_parent can become\n  stale and is updated to point to the correct inode.  However, the\n  associated CEPH_CAP_PIN reference was not being adjusted.  The\n  CEPH_CAP_PIN is a reference on an inode that is tracked for\n  accounting purposes.  Moving this pin is important to keep the\n  accounting balanced. When the pin was not moved from the old parent\n  to the new one, it created two problems: The reference on the old,\n  stale parent was never released, causing a reference leak.\n  A reference for the new parent was never acquired, creating the risk\n  of a reference underflow later in ceph_mdsc_release_request().  This\n  patch corrects the logic by releasing the pin from the old parent and\n  acquiring it for the new parent when r_parent is switched.  This\n  ensures reference accounting stays balanced. ]"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/15f519e9f883b316d86e2bb6b767a023aafd9d83", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2bfe45987eb346e299d9f763f9cd05f77011519f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db378e6f83ec705c6091c65d482d555edc2b0a72", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
