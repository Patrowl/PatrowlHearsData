Prior to version 1.8.39, the upgrade component does not validate user input properly, which allows attackers to perform local file inclusion (LFI) via a specially crafted parameter value. In order to exploit the vulnerability, the installer must be unlocked (no `install/lock` file present) and the upgrade script must be accessible (by re-installing the forum via access to `install/index.php`; when the forum has not yet been installed; or the attacker is authenticated as a forum administrator). MyBB 1.8.39 resolves this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-q4jv-xwjx-37cp", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/security/advisories/GHSA-q4jv-xwjx-37cp"}, {"name": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6e6cfbd524d9101b51e1278ecf520479b64b0f00", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/6e6cfbd524d9101b51e1278ecf520479b64b0f00"}, {"name": "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.39", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.39"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
