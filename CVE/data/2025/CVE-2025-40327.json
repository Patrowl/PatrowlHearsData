The __perf_event_overflow() callback\nis invoked from the hrtimer handler for cpu-clock events, and\n__perf_event_overflow() tries to call cpu_clock_event_stop()\nto stop the event, which calls htimer_cancel() to cancel the hrtimer.\n\nBut that's a recursion into the hrtimer code from a hrtimer handler,\nwhich (unsurprisingly) deadlocks.\n\nTo fix this bug, use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() instead, and set\nthe PERF_HES_STOPPED flag, which causes perf_swevent_hrtimer()\nto stop the event once it sees the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag.\n\n[ mingo: Fixed the comments and improved the changelog. ]"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b8c512811644cf2f5eaf6f44e928683c54127f0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eb3182ef0405ff2f6668fd3e5ff9883f60ce8801", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
