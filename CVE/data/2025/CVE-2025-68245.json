In\n     this case, there is just one.\n\n2) Another netpoll is also associated with the same NIC and\n   npinfo->refcnt += 1.\n   - Now dev->npinfo->refcnt = 2;\n   - There is just one npinfo associated to the netdev.\n\n3) When the first netpolls goes to clean up:\n   - The first cleanup succeeds and clears np->dev->npinfo, ignoring\n     refcnt.\n     - It basically calls `RCU_INIT_POINTER(np->dev->npinfo, NULL);`\n   - Set dev->npinfo = NULL, without proper cleanup\n   - No ->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() is either called\n\n4) Now the second target tries to clean up\n   - The second cleanup fails because np->dev->npinfo is already NULL.\n     * In this case, ops->ndo_netpoll_cleanup() was never called, and\n       the skb pool is not cleaned as well (for the second netpoll\n       instance)\n  - This leaks npinfo and skbpool skbs, which is clearly reported by\n    kmemleak.\n\nRevert commit efa95b01da18 (\"netpoll: fix use after free\") and adds\nclarifying comments emphasizing that npinfo cleanup should only happen\nonce the refcount reaches zero, ensuring stable and correct netpoll\nbehavior."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/49c8d2c1f94cc2f4d1a108530d7ba52614b874c2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4afd4ebbad52aa146838ec23082ba393e426a2bb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/890472d6fbf062e6de7fdd56642cb305ab79d669", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e6a50edad11e3e1426e4c29e7aa6201f3468ac2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a51b5ccd1c79afec1c03a4e1e6688da52597556", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b0bb18b4b9dc017c1825a2c5e763615e34a1593", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c645693180a98606c430825223d2029315d85e9d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c79a6d9da29219616b118a3adce9a14cd30f9bd0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
