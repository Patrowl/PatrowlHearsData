To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative&nbsp;credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because certain unencrypted credentials are stored when SIP media component logging is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials to which they may not normally have access. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information, some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII).\r\nNote: To access the logs that are stored in the Webex Cloud or stored on the device itself, an attacker must have valid administrative credentials."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-roomos-inf-disc-qGgsbxAm", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-532"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
