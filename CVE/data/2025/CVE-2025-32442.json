In versions 5.0.0 to 5.3.0 as well as version 4.9.0, applications that specify different validation strategies for different content types have a possibility to bypass validation by providing a _slightly altered_ content type such as with different casing or altered whitespacing before `;`. This was patched in v5.3.1, but the initial patch did not cover all problems. This has been fully patched in v5.3.2 and v4.9.1. A workaround involves not specifying individual content types in the schema."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-mg2h-6x62-wpwc", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/advisories/GHSA-mg2h-6x62-wpwc"}, {"name": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/436da4c06dfbbb8c24adee3a64de0c51e4f47418", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/436da4c06dfbbb8c24adee3a64de0c51e4f47418"}, {"name": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/f3d2bcb3963cd570a582e5d39aab01a9ae692fe4", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/fastify/fastify/commit/f3d2bcb3963cd570a582e5d39aab01a9ae692fe4"}, {"name": "https://hackerone.com/reports/3087928", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://hackerone.com/reports/3087928"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1287"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
