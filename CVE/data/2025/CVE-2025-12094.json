This is due to the plugin trusting client-controlled forwarded headers (such as CF-Connecting-IP, X-Forwarded-For, and others) without verifying that those headers originate from legitimate, trusted proxies. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to spoof their IP address and bypass IP-based security controls, including blocked IP lists and rate limiting protections, by sending arbitrary HTTP headers with their requests."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/oopspam-anti-spam/tags/1.2.49/include/helpers.php#L268", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3386104/oopspam-anti-spam/trunk/include/helpers.php", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b5137bc2-912b-4e25-966e-515e8d9fc21c?source=cve", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-693"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 5.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
