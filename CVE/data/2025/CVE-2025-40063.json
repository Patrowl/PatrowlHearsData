But in that same commit, the alloc_ctx and\nfree_ctx members of scomp_alg may be randomized by structure layout\nrandomization, since they are contained in a pure ops structure\n(containing only function pointers). If the pointers within scomp_alg\nare randomized, but those in crypto_acomp_streams are not, then\nthe order may no longer match. This fixes the problem by removing the\nunion from scomp_alg so that both crypto_acomp_streams and scomp_alg\nwill share the same definition of alloc_ctx and free_ctx, ensuring\nthey will always have the same layout."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/779d3b6f2d32c5f1da6163e959abe1e1ffe2945b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f75f66683ded09f7135aef2e763c245a07c8271a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
