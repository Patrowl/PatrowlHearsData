An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing a generated report file for a different domain that is managed on the same Cisco Secure FMC instance. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access a previously run report for a different domain, which could allow an attacker to read activity recorded in that domain."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fmc-authz-bypass-M7xhnAu", "name": "cisco-sa-fmc-authz-bypass-M7xhnAu"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-862"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_1", "cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
