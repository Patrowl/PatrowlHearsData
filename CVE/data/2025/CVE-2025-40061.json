This can overwrite the TASK_STATE_DRAINING state\nset by a concurrent call to rxe_cleanup_task() or rxe_disable_task().\n\nWhile state changes are protected by a spinlock, both rxe_cleanup_task()\nand rxe_disable_task() release the lock while waiting for the task to\nfinish draining in the while(!is_done(task)) loop. The race occurs if\ndo_task() hits its iteration limit and acquires the lock in this window.\nThe cleanup logic may then proceed while the task incorrectly\nreschedules itself, leading to a potential use-after-free.\n\nThis bug was introduced during the migration from tasklets to workqueues,\nwhere the special handling for the draining case was lost.\n\nFix this by restoring the original pre-migration behavior. If the state is\nTASK_STATE_DRAINING when iterations are exhausted, set cont to 1 to\nforce a new loop iteration. This allows the task to finish its work, so\nthat a subsequent iteration can reach the switch statement and correctly\ntransition the state to TASK_STATE_DRAINED, stopping the task as intended."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/52edccfb555142678c836c285bf5b4ec760bd043", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/660b6959c4170637f5db2279d1f71af33a49e49b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/85288bcf7ffe11e7b036edf91937bc62fd384076", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ca7eada62fcfabf6ec1dc7468941e791c1d8729", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
