Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only defense against untrusted inputs, the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below, `addr_len` is checked using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions are disabled, there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence, if an attacker were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN`, they can trigger a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled, the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution. Commit f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2 contains a patch for the vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-7972-w7f9-3j9m", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/security/advisories/GHSA-7972-w7f9-3j9m"}, {"name": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/f6f7de4ccc107c018630e4c15500825caf02e1c2"}, {"name": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/2025.04/sys/net/link_layer/l2filter/l2filter.c#L47", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/2025.04/sys/net/link_layer/l2filter/l2filter.c#L47"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-120"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.6, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
