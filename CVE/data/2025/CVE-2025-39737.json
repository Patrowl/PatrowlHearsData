[kworker/8:1:134]\n\nThe test system was running a workload with hot unplug happening in\nparallel.  Then kemleak decided to disable itself due to its inability to\nallocate more kmemleak objects.  The debug kernel has its\nCONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_MEM_POOL_SIZE set to 40,000.\n\nThe soft lockup happened in kmemleak_do_cleanup() when the existing\nkmemleak objects were being removed and deleted one-by-one in a loop via a\nworkqueue.  In this particular case, there are at least 40,000 objects\nthat need to be processed and given the slowness of a debug kernel and the\nfact that a raw_spinlock has to be acquired and released in\n__delete_object(), it could take a while to properly handle all these\nobjects.\n\nAs kmemleak has been disabled in this case, the object removal and\ndeletion process can be further optimized as locking isn't really needed. \nHowever, it is probably not worth the effort to optimize for such an edge\ncase that should rarely happen.  So the simple solution is to call\ncond_resched() at periodic interval in the iteration loop to avoid soft\nlockup."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ef72a7fedc5bca70e8cc980985790de10d407aa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d2d22a55ffe35c38e69795468a7addd1a80e9ce", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/926092268efdf1ed7b55cf486356c74a9e7710d1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b80430c194e4a114dc663c1025d56b4f3d0153d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f1f4e95031f84867c5821540466d62f88dab8ca", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a04de4c40aab9b338dfa989cf4aec70fd187eeb2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d1534ae23c2b6be350c8ab060803fbf6e9682adc", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e21a3ddd58733ce31afcb1e5dc3cb80a4b5bc29b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f014c10d190b92aad366e56b445daffcd1c075e4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
