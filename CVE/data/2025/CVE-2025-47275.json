Starting in version 8.0.0-BETA1 and prior to version 8.14.0, session cookies of applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK configured with CookieStore have authentication tags that can be brute forced, which may result in unauthorized access. Certain pre-conditions are required to be vulnerable to this issue: Applications using the Auth0-PHP SDK, or the Auth0/symfony, Auth0/laravel-auth0, and Auth0/wordpress SDKs that rely on the Auth0-PHP SDK; and session storage configured with CookieStore. Upgrade Auth0/Auth0-PHP to v8.14.0 to receive a patch. As an additional precautionary measure, rotating cookie encryption keys is recommended. Note that once updated, any previous session cookies will be rejected."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-g98g-r7gf-2r25", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/security/advisories/GHSA-g98g-r7gf-2r25"}, {"name": "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-9fwj-9mjf-rhj3", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/auth0/laravel-auth0/security/advisories/GHSA-9fwj-9mjf-rhj3"}, {"name": "https://github.com/auth0/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9wg9-93h9-j8ch", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/auth0/symfony/security/advisories/GHSA-9wg9-93h9-j8ch"}, {"name": "https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-2f4r-34m4-3w8q", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/auth0/wordpress/security/advisories/GHSA-2f4r-34m4-3w8q"}, {"name": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/commit/52a79480fdb246f59dbc089b81a784ae049bd389", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/commit/52a79480fdb246f59dbc089b81a784ae049bd389"}, {"name": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/releases/tag/8.14.0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/auth0/auth0-PHP/releases/tag/8.14.0"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-287"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
