When admins change Snowflake connection details in Metabase (either updating a password or changing password to private key or vice versa), Metabase would not always purge older Snowflake connection details from the application database. In order to remove older and stale connection details, Metabase would try one connection method at a time and purge all the other connection methods from the application database. When Metabase found a connection that worked, it would log (log/infof \"Successfully connected, migrating to: %s\" (pr-str test-details)) which would then print the username and password to the logger. This is fixed in 52.17.1, 53.9.5 and 54.1.5 in both the OSS and enterprise editions. Versions 51 and lower are not impacted."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-832j-56xw-5p7f", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-832j-56xw-5p7f"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-532"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "ACTIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "LOW", "subIntegrityImpact": "LOW", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 1.8, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:L/SI:L/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
