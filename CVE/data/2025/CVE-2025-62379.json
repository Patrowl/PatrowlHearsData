In versions 0.5.4 through 0.8.14, the /auth-codespace endpoint automatically assigns the redirect_to query parameter value directly to client-side links without any validation and triggers automatic clicks when the page loads in a GitHub Codespaces environment. This allows attackers to redirect users to arbitrary external URLs. The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment is detected, and the detection is controlled by environment variables. The same behavior can be activated in production if the GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN environment variable is set. The vulnerability occurs because the code assigns the redirect_to query parameter directly to a.href without any validation and immediately triggers a click (automatic navigation), allowing users to be sent to arbitrary external domains. The execution condition is based on the presence of a sessionStorage flag, meaning it triggers immediately on first visits or in incognito/private browsing windows, with no server-side origin/scheme whitelist or internal path enforcement defenses in place. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.15. As a workaround, users can ensure that GITHUB_CODESPACES_PORT_FORWARDING_DOMAIN is not set in a production environment."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/commit/ade12549f3c0ddab3d7382c581bc04a3c1f989ec", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex/security/advisories/GHSA-rfh5-c9h5-q8jm", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-601"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.6, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.1, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
