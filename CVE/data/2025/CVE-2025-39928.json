In\nparticular a data length of 0 is not supported by the hardware and\ncauses unintended or destructive behaviour.\n\nThis limitation becomes obvious when looking at the register\ndocumentation [1]. 4 bits are reserved for DATA_WIDTH and the value\nof these 4 bits is used as N + 1, allowing a data length range of\n1 <= len <= 16.\n\nAffected by this is the SMBus Quick Operation which works with a data\nlength of 0. Passing 0 as the length causes an underflow of the value\ndue to:\n\n(len - 1) & 0xf\n\nand effectively specifying a transfer length of 16 via the registers.\nThis causes a 16-byte write operation instead of a Quick Write. For\nexample, on SFP modules without write-protected EEPROM this soft-bricks\nthem by overwriting some initial bytes.\n\nFor completeness, also add a quirk for the zero length.\n\n[1] https://svanheule.net/realtek/longan/register/i2c_mst1_ctrl2"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/06418cb5a1a542a003fdb4ad8e76ea542d57cfba", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c91382328fc89f73144d5582f2d8f1dd3e41c8f7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
