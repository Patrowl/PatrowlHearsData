Prior to version 1.26.2, it's possible to poison feed favicons by adding a given URL as a feed with the proxy set to an attacker-controlled one and disabled SSL verifying. The favicon hash is computed by hashing the feed URL and the salt, whilst not including the following variables: proxy address, proxy protocol, and whether SSL should be verified. Therefore it's possible to poison a favicon of a given feed by simply intercepting the response of the feed, and changing the website URL to one where a threat actor controls the feed favicon. Feed favicons can be replaced for all users by anyone. Version 1.26.2 fixes the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8f79-3q3w-43c4", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/security/advisories/GHSA-8f79-3q3w-43c4"}, {"name": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/3776e1e48f33e80eb4b674bb64b419caf3b5a4e2", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commit/3776e1e48f33e80eb4b674bb64b419caf3b5a4e2"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-349"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
