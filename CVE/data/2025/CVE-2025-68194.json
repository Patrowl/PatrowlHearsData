This results in\nprintk() flooding (RCU stalls).\n\nAlan Stern commented [2] that\n\n  In theory it's okay to resubmit _if_ the driver has a robust\n  error-recovery scheme (such as giving up after some fixed limit on the\n  number of errors or after some fixed time has elapsed, perhaps with a\n  time delay to prevent a flood of errors).  Most drivers don't bother to\n  do this; they simply give up right away.  This makes them more\n  vulnerable to short-term noise interference during USB transfers, but in\n  reality such interference is quite rare.  There's nothing really wrong\n  with giving up right away.\n\nbut imon has a poor error-recovery scheme which just retries forever;\nthis behavior should be fixed.\n\nSince I'm not sure whether it is safe for imon users to give up upon any\nerror code, this patch takes care of only union of error codes chosen from\nmodules in drivers/media/rc/ directory which handle -EPROTO error (i.e.\nir_toy, mceusb and igorplugusb).\n\nSecond problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() once got -EPROTO error\nbefore ictx->dev_present_intf0 becomes true, usb_rx_callback_intf0() always\nresubmits urb due to commit 8791d63af0cf (\"[media] imon: don't wedge\nhardware after early callbacks\"). Move the ictx->dev_present_intf0 test\nintroduced by commit 6f6b90c9231a (\"[media] imon: don't parse scancodes\nuntil intf configured\") to immediately before imon_incoming_packet(), or\nthe first problem explained above happens without printk() flooding (i.e.\nhung task).\n\nThird problem is that when usb_rx_callback_intf0() is not called for some\nreason (e.g. flaky hardware; the reproducer for this problem sometimes\nprevents usb_rx_callback_intf0() from being called),\nwait_for_completion_interruptible() in send_packet() never returns (i.e.\nhung task). As a workaround for such situation, change send_packet() to\nwait for completion with timeout of 10 seconds."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0213e4175abbb9dfcbf7c197e3817d527f459ad5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/26f6a1dd5d81ad61a875a747698da6f27abf389b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/519737af11c03590819a6eec2ad532cfdb87ea63", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/667afd4681781f60a644cd0d2ee6c59cb1c36208", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8231e80118463be5598daaf266c1c83650f1948b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eecd203ada43a4693ce6fdd3a58ae10c7819252c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f58ab83b7b7133e6baefe03a46846c4f6ce45e2f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7f3ecb4934fff782fa9bb1cd16e2290c041b22d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
