Prior to version 1.17.0, due to the missing sanitization of the path in the `POST /api/localsend/v2/prepare-upload` and the `POST /api/localsend/v2/upload` endpoint, a malicious file transfer request can write files to the arbitrary location on the system, resulting in the remote command execution. A malicious file transfer request sent by nearby devices can write files into an arbitrary directory. This usually allows command execution via the startup folder on Windows or Bash-related files on Linux. If the user enables the `Quick Save` feature, it will silently write files without explicit user interaction. Version 1.17.0 fixes this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/security/advisories/GHSA-f7jp-p6j4-3522", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/security/advisories/GHSA-f7jp-p6j4-3522"}, {"name": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/e8635204ec782ded45bc7d698deb60f3c4105687", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/e8635204ec782ded45bc7d698deb60f3c4105687"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "ADJACENT", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:A/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
