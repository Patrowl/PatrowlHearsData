To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (path traversal). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted web request to an affected device, followed by a specific command through an SSH session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of an affected device as a low-privilege user. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to undertake further actions to elevate their privileges to root."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uccx-multi-UhOTvPGL", "name": "cisco-sa-uccx-multi-UhOTvPGL"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_1", "cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.4, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
