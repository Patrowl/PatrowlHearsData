In\npractice this isn't much of a concern as the required memory size will\nhave been validated upfront, and accounted to the user. And > 4GB sizes\nwill be necessary to make the lack of a cast a problem, which greatly\nexceeds normal user locked_vm settings that are generally in the kb to\nmb range. However, if root is used, then accounting isn't done, and\nthen it's possible to hit this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33503c083fda048c77903460ac0429e1e2c0e341", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a69a9b53c54e2d33e2a5b1ea4a9a71fd01c6cf3a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6a2706e08b8a1b2d3740161c0977d38e596c1ee", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
