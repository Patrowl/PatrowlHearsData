Prior to commit a1a41b7, the remoteBuild.yml workflow file uses actions/upload-artifact@v4 to upload the mac-standalone artifact. This artifact is a zip of the current directory, which includes the automatically generated .git/config file containing the run's GITHUB_TOKEN. Seeing as the artifact can be downloaded prior to the end of the workflow, there is a few seconds where an attacker can extract the token from the artifact and use it with the Github API to push malicious code or rewrite release commits in the AdeptLanguage/Adept repository. This issue has been patched in commit a1a41b7."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/security/advisories/GHSA-8c7v-vccv-cx4q", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/security/advisories/GHSA-8c7v-vccv-cx4q"}, {"name": "https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/commit/a1a41b72cdf1bebfc0cf6d7b3a8350e6406b2220", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept/commit/a1a41b72cdf1bebfc0cf6d7b3a8350e6406b2220"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-200"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
