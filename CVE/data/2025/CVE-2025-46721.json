A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request)."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/security/advisories/GHSA-w9hf-35q4-vcjw", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/security/advisories/GHSA-w9hf-35q4-vcjw"}, {"name": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/commit/ec9bb776d8e5ba9e906b6eb70428f4e7b009feee", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/commit/ec9bb776d8e5ba9e906b6eb70428f4e7b009feee"}, {"name": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rq77-p4h8-4crw", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rq77-p4h8-4crw"}, {"name": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf-cve-2025-46721", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf-cve-2025-46721"}, {"name": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/justinas/nosurf/releases/tag/v1.2.0"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-352"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "PASSIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
