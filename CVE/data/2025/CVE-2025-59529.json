In versions up to and including 0.9-rc2, the simple protocol server ignores the documented client limit and accepts unlimited connections, allowing for easy local DoS. Although `CLIENTS_MAX` is defined, `server_work()` unconditionally `accept()`s and `client_new()` always appends the new client and increments `n_clients`. There is no check against the limit. When client cannot be accepted as a result of maximal socket number of avahi-daemon, it logs unconditionally error per each connection. Unprivileged local users can exhaust daemon memory and file descriptors, causing a denial of service system-wide for mDNS/DNS-SD. Exhausting local file descriptors causes increased system load caused by logging errors of each of request. Overloading prevents glibc calls using nss-mdns plugins to resolve `*.local.` names and link-local addresses. As of time of publication, no known patched versions are available, but a candidate fix is available in pull request 808, and some workarounds are available. Simple clients are offered for nss-mdns package functionality. It is not possible to disable the unix socket `/run/avahi-daemon/socket`, but resolution requests received via DBus are not affected directly. Tools avahi-resolve, avahi-resolve-address and avahi-resolve-host-name are not affected, they use DBus interface. It is possible to change permissions of unix socket after avahi-daemon is started. But avahi-daemon does not provide any configuration for it. Additional access restrictions like SELinux can also prevent unwanted tools to access the socket and keep resolution working for trusted users."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/avahi/avahi/pull/808", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Issue Tracking", "Patch"]}, {"url": "https://github.com/avahi/avahi/security/advisories/GHSA-73wf-3xmj-x82q", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "https://zeropath.com/blog/avahi-simple-protocol-server-dos-cve-2025-59529", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Third Party Advisory", "Exploit"]}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/12/19/1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Exploit"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-400"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.8, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:avahi:avahi:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "6481267F-934F-4A0C-9B25-59738E798458", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "0.9"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:avahi:avahi:0.9:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "76971590-AEED-4CB1-B7B7-45EA8FD11524", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
