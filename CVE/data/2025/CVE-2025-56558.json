NOTE: the Supplier's position is that this is a potential vulnerability that dates back 4 years ago in 2022 and \"we are unable to replicate that anymore.\" Based on the submitted report, in order to leverage this issue, an attacker needs to own a Dyson device with full privileges, sniff for the AWS credentials, and then transfer ownership of that Dyson device to the victim. Even if these steps were successfully accomplished, the attacker only acquires the ability to configure the Dyson device within its safe operating range, and does not acquire the ability to execute code on the device or obtain sensitive information."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://archive.org/details/dyson-acpolicy-bug-report", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://support.dyson.com.au/supporthome/Air-Treatment/Purifier/pure-hot-cool-link/385276-01/troubleshooting/machine-is-not-heating", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.dyson.co.uk/support/reporting-data-security-issues", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.dyson.com/air-treatment/air-purifier-heaters/pure-hot-cool-hp04", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-420"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.3, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 3.0, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
