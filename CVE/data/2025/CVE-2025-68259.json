Enabling or disabling a static branch in Linux\nuses the kernel's \"text poke\" code patching mechanism.  To modify code\nwhile other CPUs may be executing that code, Linux (temporarily)\nreplaces the first byte of the original instruction with an int3 (opcode\n0xcc), then patches in the new code stream except for the first byte,\nand finally replaces the int3 with the first byte of the new code\nstream.  If a CPU hits the int3, i.e. executes the code while it's being\nmodified, then the guest kernel must look up the RIP to determine how to\nhandle the #BP, e.g. by emulating the new instruction.  If the RIP is\nincorrect, then this lookup fails and the guest kernel panics.\n\nThe bug reproduces almost instantly by hacking the guest kernel to\nrepeatedly check a static branch[1] while running a drgn script[2] on\nthe host to constantly swap out the memory containing the guest's TSS.\n\n[1]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/44d17c51c28c0ac998ea0334edf90b5a\n[2]: https://gist.github.com/osandov/10e45e45afa29b11e0c7209247afc00b"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4da3768e1820cf15cced390242d8789aed34f54d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/53903ac9ca1abffa27327e85075ec496fa55ccf3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/54bcccc2c7805a00af1d7d2faffd6f424c0133aa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87cc1622c88a4888959d64fa1fc9ba1e264aa3d4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
