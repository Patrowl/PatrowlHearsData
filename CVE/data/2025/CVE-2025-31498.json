From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-6hxc-62jh-p29v", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/security/advisories/GHSA-6hxc-62jh-p29v"}, {"name": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/pull/821", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/pull/821"}, {"name": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/commit/29d38719112639d8c0ba910254a3dd4f482ea2d1", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/commit/29d38719112639d8c0ba910254a3dd4f482ea2d1"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-416"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "LOW", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "LOW", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
