A segmentation fault was found in Vim before 9.1.1043. In silent Ex mode (-s -e), Vim typically doesn't show a screen and just operates silently in batch mode. However, it is still possible to trigger the function that handles the scrolling of a gui version of Vim by feeding some binary characters to Vim. The function that handles the scrolling however may be triggering a redraw, which will access the ScreenLines pointer, even so this variable hasn't been allocated (since there is no screen). This vulnerability is fixed in 9.1.1043."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-j3g9-wg22-v955", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/security/advisories/GHSA-j3g9-wg22-v955"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9d1bed5eccdbb46a26b8a484f5e9163c40e63919", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9d1bed5eccdbb46a26b8a484f5e9163c40e63919"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-787"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 4.2, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
