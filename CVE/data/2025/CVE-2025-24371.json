In the `blocksync` protocol peers send their `base` and `latest` heights when they connect to a new node (`A`), which is syncing to the tip of a network. `base` acts as a lower ground and informs `A` that the peer only has blocks starting from height `base`. `latest` height informs `A` about the latest block in a network. Normally, nodes would only report increasing heights. If `B` fails to provide the latest block, `B` is removed and the `latest` height (target height) is recalculated based on other nodes `latest` heights. The existing code however doesn't check for the case where `B` first reports `latest` height `X` and immediately after height `Y`, where `X > Y`. `A` will be trying to catch up to 2000 indefinitely. This condition requires the introduction of malicious code in the full node first reporting some non-existing `latest` height, then reporting lower `latest` height and nodes which are syncing using `blocksync` protocol. This issue has been patched in versions 1.0.1 and 0.38.17 and all users are advised to upgrade. Operators may attempt to ban malicious peers from the network as a workaround."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-22qq-3xwm-r5x4", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-22qq-3xwm-r5x4"}, {"name": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v0.38.17"}, {"name": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/releases/tag/v1.0.1"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-703"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "subIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "subAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
