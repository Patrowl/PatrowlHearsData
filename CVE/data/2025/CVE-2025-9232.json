However the URLs used\nby these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.\n\nIn this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash.\nFurthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be\npassed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have\na 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the\nissue was assessed as Low severity.\n\nThe vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases:\n3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as the HTTP client implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module\nboundary."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2b4ec20e47959170422922eaff25346d362dcb35", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/654dc11d23468a74fc8ea4672b702dd3feb7be4b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7cf21a30513c9e43c4bc3836c237cf086e194af3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/89e790ac431125a4849992858490bed6b225eadf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/bbf38c034cdabd0a13330abcc4855c866f53d2e0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-125"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
