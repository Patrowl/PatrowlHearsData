An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using either NETCONF, RESTCONF, or gRPC Network Management Interface (gNMI) protocols and query data on paths that may have been denied by the NACM configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access data that should have been restricted according to the NACM configuration.\r\n\r Note: This vulnerability requires that the attacker obtain the credentials from a valid user with privileges lower than 15, and that NACM was configured to provide restricted read access for that user."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-netconf-nacm-bypass-TGZV9pmQ", "name": "cisco-sa-netconf-nacm-bypass-TGZV9pmQ"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-639"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_1", "cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
