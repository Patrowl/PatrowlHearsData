This flaw can be triggered without authentication by sending specially crafted input to the target system. Improper bounds checking allows an attacker to overwrite heap memory, potentially leading to application crashes or remote code execution. Exploitation occurs in the context of the affected process and does not require user interaction. The vulnerability poses a high risk due to its pre-authentication nature and potential for full compromise. This vulnerability affects all UDP versions prior to 10.2. UDP 10.2 includes the necessary patches and requires no action. Versions 8.0 through 10.1 are supported and require either patch application or upgrade to 10.2. Versions 7.x and earlier are unsupported or out of maintenance and must be upgraded to 10.2 to remediate the issue."}], "value": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the input parsing logic of Arcserve Unified Data Protection (UDP).
