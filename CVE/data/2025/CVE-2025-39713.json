This\ncreates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as\nrain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work\nhandler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.\n\nMultiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len\nbefore it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both\ninterrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len\nbeyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.\n\nFix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full\ncheck. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification\nare performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding\nspin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the\nlock.\n\nThis possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool\ndeveloped by our team."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c2769dc80255824542ea5a4ff1a07dcdeb1603f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2964dbe631fd21ad7873b1752b895548d3c12496", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3c3e33b7edca7a2d6a96801f287f9faeb684d655", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6aaef1a75985865d8c6c5b65fb54152060faba48", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7af160aea26c7dc9e6734d19306128cce156ec40", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ed905fe7cba03cf22ae0b84cf1b73cd1c070423a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbc81e78d75bf28972bc22b1599559557b1a1b83", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ff9dd3db6cd4c6b54a2ecbc58151bea4ec63bc59", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
