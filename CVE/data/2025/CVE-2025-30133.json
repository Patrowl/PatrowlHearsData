Bypass of Device Pairing/Registration can occur. It requires device registration via the \"IROAD X View\" app for authentication, but its HTTP server lacks this restriction. Once connected to the dashcam's Wi-Fi network via the default password (\"qwertyuiop\"), an attacker can directly access the HTTP server at http://192.168.10.1 without undergoing the pairing process. Additionally, no alert is triggered on the device when an attacker connects, making this intrusion completely silent."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.iroadau.com.au/downloads/"}, {"url": "https://github.com/geo-chen/IROAD?tab=readme-ov-file#finding-7-bypass-of-device-pairingregistration-for-iroad-fx2"}, {"url": "https://github.com/geo-chen/IROAD/blob/main/README.md#finding-12---cve-2025-30133-unprotected-url-shortcut"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
