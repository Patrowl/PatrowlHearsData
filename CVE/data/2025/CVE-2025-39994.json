This leads to use-after-free scenarios\nwhere xc5000_release() may free the xc5000_priv while timer_sleep is still\nactive and attempts to dereference the xc5000_priv.\n\nA typical race condition is illustrated below:\n\nCPU 0 (release thread)                 | CPU 1 (delayed work callback)\nxc5000_release()                       | xc5000_do_timer_sleep()\n  cancel_delayed_work()                |\n  hybrid_tuner_release_state(priv)     |\n    kfree(priv)                        |\n                                       |   priv = container_of() // UAF\n\nReplace cancel_delayed_work() with cancel_delayed_work_sync() to ensure\nthat the timer_sleep is properly canceled before the xc5000_priv memory\nis deallocated.\n\nA deadlock concern was considered: xc5000_release() is called in a process\ncontext and is not holding any locks that the timer_sleep work item might\nalso need. Therefore, the use of the _sync() variant is safe here.\n\nThis bug was initially identified through static analysis.\n\n[hverkuil: fix typo in Subject: tunner -> tuner]"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/40b7a19f321e65789612ebaca966472055dab48c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4266f012806fc18e46da4a04d130df59a4946f93", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71ed8b81a4906cb785966910f39cf7f5ad60a69e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9a00de20ed8ba90888479749b87bc1532cded4ce", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/df0303b4839520b84d9367c2fad65b13650a4d42", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/effb1c19583bca7022fa641a70766de45c6d41ac", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
