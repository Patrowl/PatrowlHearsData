There is a vulnerability in SuiteCRM version 7.14.6 which allows unauthenticated downloads of any file from the upload-directory, as long as it is named by an ID (e.g. attachments). An unauthenticated attacker could download internal files when he discovers a valid file-ID.\nValid IDs could be brute-forced, but this is quite time-consuming as the file-IDs are usually UUIDs. This issue is fixed in version 7.14.7."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-8r72-224q-g9fv", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM/security/advisories/GHSA-8r72-224q-g9fv"}, {"name": "https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/releases/7.14.x/#_7_14_7", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/releases/7.14.x/#_7_14_7"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-285"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
