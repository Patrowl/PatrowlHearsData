By accessing specific URLs, an attacker is presented with a directory-style index listing all available backend services and POS web services, each with an HTML form for submitting test input. These panels are intended for developer use, but are accessible in production environments with no authentication or session validation. This grants any external actor the ability to discover, test, and execute API endpoints that perform critical functions including but not limited to user transaction retrieval, credit adjustments, POS actions, and internal data queries."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "http://aptsys.com", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://gist.github.com/ReverseThatApp/4a6be2b9b2ba39d38c35c8753e0afd39", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
