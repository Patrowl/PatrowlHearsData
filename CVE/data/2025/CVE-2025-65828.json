These commands include: shutdown, restart, clear config. Clear config would disassociate the current device from its user and would require re-configuration to re-enable the device. As a result, the end user would be unable to receive updates from the Meatmeet base station which communicates with the cloud services until the device had been fixed or turned back on."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "http://meatmeet.com", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://gist.github.com/dead1nfluence/4dffc239b4a460f41a03345fd8e5feb5#file-denial-of-service-ble-md", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
