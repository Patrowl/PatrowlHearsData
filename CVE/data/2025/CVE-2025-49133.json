Libtpms, which is derived from the TPM 2.0 reference implementation code published by the Trusted Computing Group, is prone to a potential out of bounds (OOB) read vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs in the \u2018CryptHmacSign\u2019 function with an inconsistent pairing of the signKey and signScheme parameters, where the signKey is ALG_KEYEDHASH key and inScheme is an ECC or RSA scheme. The reported vulnerability is in the \u2018CryptHmacSign\u2019 function, which is defined in the \"Part 4: Supporting Routines \u2013 Code\" document, section \"7.151 - /tpm/src/crypt/CryptUtil.c \". This vulnerability can be triggered from user-mode applications by sending malicious commands to a TPM 2.0/vTPM (swtpm) whose firmware is based on an affected TCG reference implementation. The effect on libtpms is that it will cause an abort due to the detection of the out-of-bounds access, thus for example making a vTPM (swtpm) unavailable to a VM. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.12, 0.8.10, 0.9.7, and 0.10.1."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/security/advisories/GHSA-25w5-6fjj-hf8g", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/security/advisories/GHSA-25w5-6fjj-hf8g"}, {"name": "https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/commit/04b2d8e9afc0a9b6bffe562a23e58c0de11532d1", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/stefanberger/libtpms/commit/04b2d8e9afc0a9b6bffe562a23e58c0de11532d1"}, {"name": "https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification"}, {"name": "https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-4-Supporting-Routines-Code.pdf", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-4-Supporting-Routines-Code.pdf"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-125"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
