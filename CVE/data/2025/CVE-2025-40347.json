This issue is caused by the\nrecursive acquisition of the read lock enetc_mdio_lock. Here list some\nof the call stacks identified under the enetc_poll path that may lead to\na deadlock:\n\nenetc_poll\n  -> enetc_lock_mdio\n  -> enetc_clean_rx_ring OR napi_complete_done\n     -> napi_gro_receive\n        -> enetc_start_xmit\n           -> enetc_lock_mdio\n           -> enetc_map_tx_buffs\n           -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n  -> enetc_unlock_mdio\n\nAfter enetc_poll acquires the read lock, a higher-priority writer attempts\nto acquire the lock, causing preemption. The writer detects that a\nread lock is already held and is scheduled out. However, readers under\nenetc_poll cannot acquire the read lock again because a writer is already\nwaiting, leading to a thread hang.\n\nCurrently, the deadlock is avoided by adjusting enetc_lock_mdio to prevent\nrecursive lock acquisition."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f92f5bd057a4fad9dab6af17963cdd21e5da6ed", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2781ca82ce8cad263d80b617addb727e6a84c9e5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e55a49dc3b2a6b23329e4fbbd8a5feb20e220aa", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50bd33f6b3922a6b760aa30d409cae891cec8fb5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
