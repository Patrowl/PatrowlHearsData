Therefore, error routes are not\nflushed when their nexthop object is deleted:\n\n # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy\n # ip nexthop add id 1 dev dummy1\n # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 1\n # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.2/32 nhid 1\n # ip nexthop del id 1\n # ip route show\n blackhole 198.51.100.2 nhid 1 dev dummy1\n\nAs such, they keep holding a reference on the nexthop object which in\nturn holds a reference on the nexthop device, resulting in a reference\ncount leak:\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n [   70.516258] unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = 2\n\nFix by flushing error routes when their nexthop is marked as dead.\n\nIPv6 does not suffer from this problem."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/30386e090c49e803c0616a7147e43409c32a2b0e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33ff5c207c873215e54e6176624ed57423cb7dea", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5979338c83012110ccd45cae6517591770bfe536", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5de7ad7e18356e39e8fbf7edd185a5faaf4f385a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac782f4e3bfcde145b8a7f8af31d9422d94d172a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3fc381320d04e4a74311e576a86cac49a16fc43", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee4183501ea556dca31f5ffd8690aa9fd25b609f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
