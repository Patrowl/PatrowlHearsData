Starting in version 12.109.0 and prior to version 2025.2.0-alpha.0, due to a lack of CSRF protection and the lack of proper security attributes in the authentication cookies of Bull's dashboard, some of the APIs of bull-board may be subject to CSRF attacks. There is a risk of this vulnerability being used for attacks with relatively large impact on availability and integrity, such as the ability to add arbitrary jobs. This vulnerability was fixed in 2025.2.0-alpha.0. As a workaround, block all access to the `/queue` directory with a web application firewall (WAF)."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-38w6-vx8g-67pp", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-38w6-vx8g-67pp"}, {"name": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/77e421029cb564a97f42b6e41c9edce49f79cecd", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/77e421029cb564a97f42b6e41c9edce49f79cecd"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-352"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-614"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1275"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
