After PFCP association, a specially crafted PFCP Session Establishment Request with a CreatePDR that contains a malformed Flow-Description is not robustly validated. The Flow-Description parser (parseFlowDesc) can read beyond the bounds of the provided buffer, causing a panic and terminating the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Session Establishment Request messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this issue to repeatedly crash the UPF."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/omec-project/upf/issues/959", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
