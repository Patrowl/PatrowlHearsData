Specifically, dde-api-proxy runs as root and forwards messages from arbitrary local users to legacy D-Bus methods in the actual D-Bus services, and the actual D-Bus services don't know about the proxy situation (they believe that root is asking them to do things). Consequently several proxied methods, that shouldn't be accessible to non-root users, are accessible to non-root users. In situations where Polkit is involved, the caller would be treated as admin, resulting in a similar escalation of privileges."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1229918"}, {"url": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/24/3"}, {"url": "https://security.opensuse.org/2025/01/24/dde-api-proxy-privilege-escalation.html"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-940"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "baseScore": 8.4, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:deepin:dde-api-proxy:1.0.19:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
