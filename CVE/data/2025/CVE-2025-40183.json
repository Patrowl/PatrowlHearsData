A recent BPF change utilized the bpf_redirect_neigh() helper to\nforward packets after the arrival and decap on vxlan, which turned out\nover time that the kmalloc-256 slab usage in kernel was ever-increasing.\n\nThe issue was that vxlan allocates the metadata_dst object and attaches\nit through a fake dst entry to the skb. The latter was never released\nthough given bpf_redirect_neigh() was merely setting the new dst entry\nvia skb_dst_set() without dropping an existing one first."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/057764172fcc6ee2ccb6c41351a55a9f054dc8fd", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23f3770e1a53e6c7a553135011f547209e141e72", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e67c2037382abb56497bb9d7b7e10be04eb5598", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3fba965a9aac0fa3cbd8138436a37af9ab466d79", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7404ce888a45eb7da0508b7cbbe6f2e95302eeb8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b6bfe44b6dbb14a31d86c475cdc9c7689534fb09", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f36a305d30f557306d87c787ddffe094ac5dac89", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
