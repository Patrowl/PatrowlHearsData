The application fails to properly validate uploaded file contents. Additionally, the application preserves the user-supplied file extension during the save process. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary PHP code by spoofing the MIME type as an image, leading to full system compromise."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/ismaildawoodjee/vulnerability-research/security/advisories/GHSA-8xq6-hjhw-4983", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/18572/modern-image-gallery-app-using-php-and-mysql-source-code.html", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
