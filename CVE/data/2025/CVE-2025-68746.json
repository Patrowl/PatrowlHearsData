Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ\nthread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the\nextra check for a valid transfer."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/01bbf25c767219b14c3235bfa85906b8d2cb8fbc", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/551060efb156c50fe33799038ba8145418cfdeef", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/83309dd551cfd60a5a1a98d9cab19f435b44d46d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b4e002d8a7cee3b1d70efad0e222567f92a73000", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bb0c58be84f907285af45657c1d4847b960a12bf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c934e40246da2c5726d14e94719c514e30840df8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
