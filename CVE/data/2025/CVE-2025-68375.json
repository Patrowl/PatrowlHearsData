When\nintel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() calls perf_event_overflow() to process the\nlast PEBS record of PEBS event a, interrupt throttle is triggered and\nall pointers of event a and event b are cleared to NULL. Then\nintel_pmu_drain_pebs_icl() tries to process the last PEBS record of\nevent b and encounters NULL pointer access.\n\nTo avoid this issue, move cpuc->events[] clearing from x86_pmu_stop()\nto x86_pmu_del(). It's safe since cpuc->active_mask or\ncpuc->pebs_enabled is always checked before access the event pointer\nfrom cpuc->events[]."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b089028bff1f2ff9e0c62b8f1faca1a620e5d6e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e772a93eb61cb6265bdd1c5bde17d0f2718b452", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cf69b99805c263117305ac6dffbc85aaf9259d32", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
