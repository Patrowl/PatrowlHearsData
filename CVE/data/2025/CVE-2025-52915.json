This is caused by insufficient caller validation in the driver's IOCTL handler, enabling unauthorized processes to perform those actions in kernel space. Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service by disrupting critical third-party services or applications."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://k7computing.com", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://support.k7computing.com/index.php?/solutions/view-article/Advisory-issued-on-2nd-Sep-2025", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
