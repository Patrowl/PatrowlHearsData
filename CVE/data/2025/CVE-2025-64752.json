Prior to version 1.7.7, a user with access to any document on a Grist installation can use a feature for fetching from a URL that is executed on the server. The privileged network access of server-side requests could offer opportunities for attack escalation. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.7. The mitigation was to use the proxy for untrusted fetches intended for such purposes. As a workaround, avoid making http/https endpoints available to an instance running Grist that expose credentials or operate without credentials."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/releases/tag/v1.7.7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-qh95-2qv8-pqx3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-918"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 4.0, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
