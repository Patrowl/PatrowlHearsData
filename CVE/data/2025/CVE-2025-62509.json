Prior to version 1.4.0, a business logic flaw in FileRise\u2019s file/folder handling allows low-privilege users to perform unauthorized operations (view/delete/modify) on files created by other users. The root cause was inferring ownership/visibility from folder names (e.g., a folder named after a username) and missing server-side authorization/ownership checks across file operation endpoints. This amounted to an IDOR pattern: an attacker could operate on resources identified only by predictable names. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.0 and further hardened in version 1.5.0. A workaround for this issue involves restricting non-admin users to read-only or disable delete/rename APIs server-side, avoid creating top-level folders named after other usernames, and adding server-side checks that verify ownership before delete/rename/move."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/error311/FileRise/commit/25ce6a76beb60950359c0304765ad91a8aff8ad8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/error311/FileRise/issues/53", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/error311/FileRise/security/advisories/GHSA-6p87-q9rh-95wh", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-280"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-284"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.2, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
