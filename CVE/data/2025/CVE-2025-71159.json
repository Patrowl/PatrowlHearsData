Another\nthread can then read btrfs_inode->delayed_node and attempt to\nincrement a refcount that hasn't been set yet, leading to a\nrefcounting bug and a use-after-free warning.\n\nThe fix is to move refcount_set back to where it was to take\nadvantage of the implicit memory barrier provided by lock\nacquisition.\n\nBecause the allocations now happen outside of the lock's critical\nsection, they can use GFP_NOFS instead of GFP_ATOMIC."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/83f59076a1ae6f5c6845d6f7ed3a1a373d883684", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c8385851a5435f4006281828d428e5d0b0bbf8af", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
