The q URL parameter allows a user to filter users by any column, and filter password=~ could be abused to leak out a user's password hash character by character. An attacker with administrator access could exploit this to leak highly sensitive information stored in the Harbor database. All endpoints that support the q URL parameter are vulnerable to this ORM leak attack."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases"}, {"url": "https://www.elttam.com/blog/plormbing-your-django-orm/"}, {"url": "https://goharbor.io/blog/"}, {"url": "https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/advisories/GHSA-h27m-3qw8-3pw8"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
