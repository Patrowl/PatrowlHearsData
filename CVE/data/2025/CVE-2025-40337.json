The hardware status, indicating a header or\npayload checksum failure, was being ignored at this stage. This could\ncause corrupt packets to be passed up the network stack as valid.\n\nThis patch corrects the logic by checking the `csum_none` status flag,\nwhich is set when the hardware reports a checksum error. If this flag\nis set, skb->ip_summed is now correctly set to CHECKSUM_NONE,\nensuring the kernel's network stack will perform its own validation and\nproperly handle the corrupt packet."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1aa319e0f12d2d761a31556b82a5852c98eb0bea", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/63fbe0e6413279d5ea5842e2423e351ded547683", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/719fcdf29051f7471d5d433475af76219019d33d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ee0aace5f844ef59335148875d05bec8764e71e8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
