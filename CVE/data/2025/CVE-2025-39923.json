This is often the case for remotely-controlled or\nremotely-powered BAM instances. In this case, we need to read num-channels\nfrom the DT to have all the necessary information to complete probing.\n\nHowever, at the moment invalid device trees without clock and without\nnum-channels still continue probing, because the error handling is missing\nreturn statements. The driver will then later try to read the number of\nchannels from the registers. This is unsafe, because it relies on boot\nfirmware and lucky timing to succeed. Unfortunately, the lack of proper\nerror handling here has been abused for several Qualcomm SoCs upstream,\ncausing early boot crashes in several situations [1, 2].\n\nAvoid these early crashes by erroring out when any of the required DT\nproperties are missing. Note that this will break some of the existing DTs\nupstream (mainly BAM instances related to the crypto engine). However,\nclearly these DTs have never been tested properly, since the error in the\nkernel log was just ignored. It's safer to disable the crypto engine for\nthese broken DTBs.\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/CY01EKQVWE36.B9X5TDXAREPF@fairphone.com/\n[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230626145959.646747-1-krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org/"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0ff9df758af7022d749718fb6b8385cc5693acf3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d98ba204d8a6db0d986c7f1aefaa0dcd1c007a2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1fc14731f0be4885e60702b9596d14d9a79cf053", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2e257a6125c63350f00dc42b9674f20fd3cf4a9f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5068b5254812433e841a40886e695633148d362d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/555bd16351a35c79efb029a196975a5a27f7fbc4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6ac1599d0e78036d9d08efc2f58c2d91f0a3ee4c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebf6c7c908e5999531c3517289598f187776124f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/10/msg00008.html", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
