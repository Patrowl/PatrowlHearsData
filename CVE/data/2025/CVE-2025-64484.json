In versions prior to 7.13.0, all deployments of OAuth2 Proxy in front of applications that normalize underscores to dashes in HTTP headers (e.g., WSGI-based frameworks such as Django, Flask, FastAPI, and PHP applications). Authenticated users can inject underscore variants of X-Forwarded-* headers that bypass the proxy\u2019s filtering logic, potentially escalating privileges in the upstream app. OAuth2 Proxy authentication/authorization itself is not compromised. The problem has been patched with v7.13.0. By default all specified headers will now be normalized, meaning that both capitalization and the use of underscores (_) versus dashes (-) will be ignored when matching headers to be stripped. For example, both `X-Forwarded-For` and `X_Forwarded-for` will now be treated as equivalent and stripped away. For those who have a rational that requires keeping a similar looking header and not stripping it, the maintainers introduced a new configuration field for Headers managed through the AlphaConfig called `InsecureSkipHeaderNormalization`. As a workaround, ensure filtering and processing logic in upstream services don't treat underscores and hyphens in Headers the same way."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-4.2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-3.2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/security/advisories/GHSA-vjrc-mh2v-45x6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.security.telekom.com/2020/05/smuggling-http-headers-through-reverse-proxies.html", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.uptimia.com/questions/why-are-http-headers-with-underscores-dropped-by-nginx", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-644"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.1, "impactScore": 4.7, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 8.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
