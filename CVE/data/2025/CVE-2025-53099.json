Prior to version 25.5.0, an attacker with a malicious OAuth application registered with Sentry can take advantage of a race condition and improper handling of authorization code within Sentry to maintain persistence to a user's account. With a specially timed requests and redirect flows, an attacker could generate multiple authorization codes that could be used to exchange for access and refresh tokens. This was possible even after de-authorizing the particular application. This issue has been patched in version 25.5.0. Self-hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version 25.5.0 or higher. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-mgh8-h4xc-pfmj", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/security/advisories/GHSA-mgh8-h4xc-pfmj"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/85570", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/85570"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/85571", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/85571"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/86069", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/86069"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/86532", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/86532"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/57f0129e1e977b76fe8d16667a586578791a3dcd", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/57f0129e1e977b76fe8d16667a586578791a3dcd"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/ab5fd932ca6bd46529ba3308b4669e3cee719b8f", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/ab5fd932ca6bd46529ba3308b4669e3cee719b8f"}, {"name": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/e6241254aead969e6c8490a81cde9a01335df19d", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/e6241254aead969e6c8490a81cde9a01335df19d"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-288"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "PASSIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "subIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "subAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
