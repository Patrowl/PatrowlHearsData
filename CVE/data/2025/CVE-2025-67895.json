This API allowed Dag author to perform Remote Code Execution in the webserver context, which Dag Author was not supposed to be able to do.\n\nIf you installed and configured Edge3 provider for Airflow 2, you should uninstall it and migrate to Airflow 3. The new Edge3 provider versions (>=2.0.0) has minimum version of Airflow set to 3 and the RCE-prone Airflow 2 code is removed, so it should no longer be possible to use the Edge3 provider 2.0.0+ on Airflow 2.\n\nIf you used Edge Provider in Airflow 3, you are not affected."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/59143", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/hhnmmzkj5qx5gbk6pdkh8tcsx5oj1nqs", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/12/16/3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-669"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
