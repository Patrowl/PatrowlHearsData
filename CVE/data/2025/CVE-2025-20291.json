Cisco has addressed this vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Meetings service, and no customer action is needed.\r\n\r This vulnerability existed because of insufficient validation of URLs that were included in a meeting-join URL. Prior to this vulnerability being addressed, an attacker could have exploited this vulnerability by including a URL to a website of their choosing in a specific value of a Cisco Webex Meetings join URL. A successful exploit could have allowed the attacker to redirect a targeted user to a website that was controlled by the attacker, possibly making the user more likely to believe the website was trusted by Webex and perform additional actions as part of phishing attacks."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-urlredirect-uK8dDJSZ", "name": "cisco-sa-webex-urlredirect-uK8dDJSZ"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-601"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_1", "cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
