At the same\ntime, the code in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can\nbe generated, which is why it stores them in an int[2] array. However,\nas previously noted, the macro UASM_i_LA_mostly (and now UASM_i_LA)\ncauses a buffer overflow when _mcount is beyond 32 bits. This leads to\ncorruption of the variables located in the __read_mostly section.\n\nThis corruption was observed because the variable\n__cpu_primary_thread_mask was corrupted, causing a hang very early\nduring boot.\n\nThis fix prevents the corruption by avoiding the generation of\ninstructions if they could exceed 2 instructions in\nlength. Fortunately, insn_la_mcount is only used if the instrumented\ncode is located outside the kernel code section, so dynamic ftrace can\nstill be used, albeit in a more limited scope. This is still\npreferable to corrupting memory and/or crashing the kernel."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/36dac9a3dda1f2bae343191bc16b910c603cac25", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f39b9d0e86ed6236b9a5fb67616ab1f76c4f150", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e3e33ac2eb69d595079a1a1e444c2fb98efdd42d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
