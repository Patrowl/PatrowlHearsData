In versions 0.5.0b3.dev89 and below, there is an opportunity for path traversal in pyLoad-ng CNL Blueprint via package parameter, allowing Arbitrary File Write which leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The addcrypted endpoint in pyload-ng suffers from an unsafe path construction vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated attackers to write arbitrary files outside the designated storage directory. This can be abused to overwrite critical system files, including cron jobs and systemd services, leading to privilege escalation and remote code execution as root. This issue is fixed in version 0.5.0b3.dev90."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-48rp-jc79-2264", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/security/advisories/GHSA-48rp-jc79-2264"}, {"name": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/pull/4596", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/pull/4596"}, {"name": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/70a44fe02c03bce92337b5d370d2a45caa4de3d4", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/pyload/pyload/commit/70a44fe02c03bce92337b5d370d2a45caa4de3d4"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-22"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 9.8, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
