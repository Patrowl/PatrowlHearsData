However, if\nthe client already has a SHARE_ACCESS_READ open from a previous OPEN\noperation, this action overwrites the existing pointer without\nreleasing its reference, orphaning the previous reference.\n\nAdditionally, the function originally stored the same nfsd_file\npointer in both fp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] and fp->fi_rdeleg_file with\nonly a single reference. When put_deleg_file() runs, it clears\nfi_rdeleg_file and calls nfs4_file_put_access() to release the file.\n\nHowever, nfs4_file_put_access() only releases fi_fds[O_RDONLY] when\nthe fi_access[O_RDONLY] counter drops to zero. If another READ open\nexists on the file, the counter remains elevated and the nfsd_file\nreference from the delegation is never released. This potentially\ncauses open conflicts on that file.\n\nThen, on server shutdown, these leaks cause __nfsd_file_cache_purge()\nto encounter files with an elevated reference count that cannot be\ncleaned up, ultimately triggering a BUG() in kmem_cache_destroy()\nbecause there are still nfsd_file objects allocated in that cache."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8072e34e1387d03102b788677d491e2bcceef6f5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c07dc84ed67c5a182273171639bacbbb87c12175", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
