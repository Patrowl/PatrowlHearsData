This vulnerability is caused by adding note titles to the document using React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, without first escaping HTML entities. Joplin lacks a Content-Security-Policy with a restrictive `script-src`. This allows arbitrary JavaScript execution via inline `onclick`/`onload` event handlers in unsanitized HTML. Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution. Anyone who 1) receives notes from unknown sources and 2) uses <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>p</kbd> to search is impacted. This issue has been addressed in version 3.1.24 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/security/advisories/GHSA-9gfv-q6wj-fr3c"}, {"name": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/360ece6f8873ef81afbfb98b25faad696ffccdb6", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/commit/360ece6f8873ef81afbfb98b25faad696ffccdb6"}, {"name": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src"}, {"name": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/2fc9bd476b0d9abcddb0a46f615a48333779d225/packages/app-desktop/plugins/GotoAnything.tsx#L558", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/2fc9bd476b0d9abcddb0a46f615a48333779d225/packages/app-desktop/plugins/GotoAnything.tsx#L558"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
