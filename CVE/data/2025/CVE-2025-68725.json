GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.\n\nWe get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting\ngso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense\nthat this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due\nto the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy\nthrough setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific\nassumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further\ninto the GSO engine in the first place.\n\nThe checks were added in 121d57af308d (\"gso: validate gso_type in GSO\nhandlers\") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine\na protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such\npackets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via\nnetif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs\ncould be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be\nan additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case. Given\nbpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF test infra could emit\nsuch packets, lets reject them right there."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04a899573fb87273a656f178b5f920c505f68875", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fbea4c63b5385588cb44ab21f91e55e33c719a54", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
