If such dentry is a directory,\nexportfs_decode_fh_raw() will then try to connect this dentry to the\ndentry tree through reconnect_path(). It may happen for various reasons\n(such as corrupted fs or race with rename) that the call to\nlookup_one_unlocked() in reconnect_one() will fail to find the dentry we\nare trying to reconnect and instead create a new dentry under the\nparent. Now this dentry will not be marked as disconnected although the\nparent still may well be disconnected (at least in case this\ninconsistency happened because the fs is corrupted and .. doesn't point\nto the real parent directory). This creates inconsistency in\ndisconnected flags but AFAICS it was mostly harmless. At least until\ncommit f1ee616214cb (\"VFS: don't keep disconnected dentries on d_anon\")\nwhich removed adding of most disconnected dentries to sb->s_anon list.\nThus after this commit cleanup of disconnected dentries implicitely\nrelies on the fact that dput() will immediately reclaim such dentries.\nHowever when some leaf dentry isn't marked as disconnected, as in the\nscenario described above, the reclaim doesn't happen and the dentries\nare \"leaked\". Memory reclaim can eventually reclaim them but otherwise\nthey stay in memory and if umount comes first, we hit infamous \"Busy\ninodes after unmount\" bug. Make sure all dentries created under a\ndisconnected parent are marked as disconnected as well."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/20863bb7fbb016379f8227122edfabc5c799bc79", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/56094ad3eaa21e6621396cc33811d8f72847a834", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/620f3b0ede9c5cb4976cd0457d0b04ad551e5d6b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e0c8aaf4e28918abded547a5147c7d52c4af7d2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8004d4b8cbf1bd68a23c160d57287e177c82cc69", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b5abafd0aa8d7bcb935c8f91e4cfc2f2820759e4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cebfbf40056a4d858b2a3ca59a69936d599bd209", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eadc49999fa994d6fbd70c332bd5d5051cc42261", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
