We still detect\n\"write conflicts\", but no longer try to be smart about them.\nWe decided to disconnect hard instead: upper layers must not submit concurrent\nwrites. If they do, that's their fault."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00c9c9628b49e368d140cfa61d7df9b8922ec2a8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0336bfe9c237476bd7c45605a36ca79c2bca62e5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3a896498f6f577e57bf26aaa93b48c22b6d20c20", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/46e3763dcae0ffcf8fcfaff4fc10a90a92ffdd89", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57418de35420cedab035aa1da8a26c0499b7f575", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7d483ad300fc0a06f69b019dda8f74970714baf8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/810cd546a29bfac90ed1328ea01d693d4bd11cb1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/84ef8dd3238330d1795745ece83b19f0295751bf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9f53b2433ad248cd3342cc345f56f5c7904bd8c4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
