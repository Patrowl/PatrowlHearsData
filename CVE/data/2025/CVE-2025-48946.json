Currently, no concrete attack on the algorithm is known. However, prospective users of HQC must take extra care when using the algorithm in protocols involving key derivation. In particular, HQC does not provide the same security guarantees as Kyber or ML-KEM. There is currently no patch for the HQC flaw available in liboqs, so HQC is disabled by default in liboqs starting from version 0.13.0. OQS will update its implementation after the HQC team releases an updated algorithm specification."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-3rxw-4v8q-9gq5", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/security/advisories/GHSA-3rxw-4v8q-9gq5"}, {"name": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/a7d698ca9c9d98990647459253183cbe29c550af", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/a7d698ca9c9d98990647459253183cbe29c550af"}, {"name": "https://durumcrustulum.com/2024/02/24/how-to-hold-kems/#hqc", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://durumcrustulum.com/2024/02/24/how-to-hold-kems/#hqc"}, {"name": "https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/Wiu4ZQo3fP80", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/Wiu4ZQo3fP80"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-327"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 3.7, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
