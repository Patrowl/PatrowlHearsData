However, given that it is\npossible to add support for such certificates via a custom provider, coupled\nwith the fact that in such a custom provider context the private key may be\nrecoverable via remote timing measurements, we consider this to be a Moderate\nseverity issue.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this\nissue, as SM2 is not an approved algorithm."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/567f64386e43683888212226824b6a179885a0fe", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cba616c26ac8e7b37de5e77762e505ba5ca51698", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/eed5adc9f969d77c94f213767acbb41ff923b6f4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fc47a2ec078912b3e914fab5734535e76c4820c2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-385"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 2.5, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L", "baseScore": 6.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
