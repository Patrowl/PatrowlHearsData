Versions 0.3.0 and prior are vulnerable to CSV injection, also known as formula injection, in the Quick Export feature. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious content into exported CSV files. When the CSV file is opened in spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel, the malicious input may be interpreted as a formula or command, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's device. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, including the establishment of a reverse shell. Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.1 or later."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/unopim/unopim/security/advisories/GHSA-74rg-6f92-g6wx", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/unopim/unopim/security/advisories/GHSA-74rg-6f92-g6wx"}, {"name": "https://github.com/unopim/unopim/commit/b25db9496fc147842a519d1dd42ec03c3bf00a34", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/unopim/unopim/commit/b25db9496fc147842a519d1dd42ec03c3bf00a34"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1236"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "PASSIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "NONE", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "NONE", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "NONE", "subConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "subIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "subAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 2.5, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:P", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
