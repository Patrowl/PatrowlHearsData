When the\nIMM parallel port SCSI host adapter is detached through imm_detach(),\nthe imm_struct device instance is deallocated.\n\nHowever, the delayed work might still be pending or executing\nwhen imm_detach() is called, leading to use-after-free bugs\nwhen the work function imm_interrupt() accesses the already\nfreed imm_struct memory.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0(detach thread)   | CPU 1\n                       | imm_queuecommand()\n                       |   imm_queuecommand_lck()\nimm_detach()           |     schedule_delayed_work()\n  kfree(dev) //FREE    | imm_interrupt()\n                       |   dev = container_of(...) //USE\n                           dev-> //USE\n\nAdd disable_delayed_work_sync() in imm_detach() to guarantee proper\ncancellation of the delayed work item before imm_struct is deallocated."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/31ab2aad7a7b7501e904a09bf361e44671f66092", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/48dd41fa2d6c6a0c50e714deeba06ffe7f91961b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9e434426cc23ad5e2aad649327b59aea00294b13", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab58153ec64fa3fc9aea09ca09dc9322e0b54a7c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
