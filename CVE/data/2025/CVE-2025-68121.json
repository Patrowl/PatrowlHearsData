This may happen when a user calls Config.Clone and mutates the returned Config, or uses Config.GetConfigForClient. This can cause a client to resume a session with a server that it would not have resumed with during the initial handshake, or cause a server to resume a session with a client that it would not have resumed with during the initial handshake."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://go.dev/cl/737700", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://go.dev/issue/77217", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/K09ubi9FQFk", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4337", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
