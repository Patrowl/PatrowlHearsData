In versions 0.72.0 through 0.83.0, Outline introduced a feature which facilitates local file system storage capabilities as an optional file storage strategy. This feature allowed a CSP bypass as well as a ContentType bypass that might facilitate further attacks. In the case of self-hosting and using Outline FILE_STORAGE=local on the same domain as the Outline application, a malicious payload can be uploaded as a file attachment and bypass those CSP restrictions, allowing script execution within the context of another user. This is fixed in version 0.84.0."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/outline/outline/security/advisories/GHSA-gcj7-c9jv-fhgf", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/outline/outline/security/advisories/GHSA-gcj7-c9jv-fhgf"}, {"name": "https://github.com/outline/outline/commit/18bc93c9c207329244c6909606a2393e863892a3", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/outline/outline/commit/18bc93c9c207329244c6909606a2393e863892a3"}, {"name": "https://github.com/outline/outline/releases/tag/v0.84.0", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/outline/outline/releases/tag/v0.84.0"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
