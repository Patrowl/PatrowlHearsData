However, the set(nsh(...)) has a very different\nmemory layout.  Nested attributes in there are doubled in size in\ncase of the masked set().  That makes proper validation impossible.\n\nThere is also confusion in the code between the 'masked' flag, that\nsays that the nested attributes are doubled in size containing both\nthe value and the mask, and the 'is_mask' that says that the value\nwe're parsing is the mask.  This is causing kernel crash on trying to\nwrite into mask part of the match with SW_FLOW_KEY_PUT() during\nvalidation, while validate_nsh() doesn't allocate any memory for it:\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 1c2383067 P4D 1c2383067 PUD 20b703067 PMD 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\n  CPU: 8 UID: 0 Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.17.0-rc4+ #107 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  RIP: 0010:nsh_key_put_from_nlattr+0x19d/0x610 [openvswitch]\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   validate_nsh+0x60/0x90 [openvswitch]\n   validate_set.constprop.0+0x270/0x3c0 [openvswitch]\n   __ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x477/0x860 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_nla_copy_actions+0x8d/0x100 [openvswitch]\n   ovs_packet_cmd_execute+0x1cc/0x310 [openvswitch]\n   genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xdb/0x130\n   genl_family_rcv_msg+0x14b/0x220\n   genl_rcv_msg+0x47/0xa0\n   netlink_rcv_skb+0x53/0x100\n   genl_rcv+0x24/0x40\n   netlink_unicast+0x280/0x3b0\n   netlink_sendmsg+0x1f7/0x430\n   ____sys_sendmsg+0x36b/0x3a0\n   ___sys_sendmsg+0x87/0xd0\n   __sys_sendmsg+0x6d/0xd0\n   do_syscall_64+0x7b/0x2c0\n   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\n\nThe third issue with this process is that while trying to convert\nthe non-masked set into masked one, validate_set() copies and doubles\nthe size of the OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH as if it didn't have any nested\nattributes.  It should be copying each nested attribute and doubling\nthem in size independently.  And the process must be properly reversed\nduring the conversion back from masked to a non-masked variant during\nthe flow dump.\n\nIn the end, the only two outcomes of trying to use this action are\neither validation failure or a kernel crash.  And if somehow someone\nmanages to install a flow with such an action, it will most definitely\nnot do what it is supposed to, since all the keys and the masks are\nmixed up.\n\nFixing all the issues is a complex task as it requires re-writing\nmost of the validation code.\n\nGiven that and the fact that this functionality never worked since\nintroduction, let's just remove it altogether.  It's better to\nre-introduce it later with a proper implementation instead of trying\nto fix it in stable releases."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0b903f33c31c82b1c3591279fd8a23893802b987", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3415faa1fcb4150f29a72c5ecf959339d797feb7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d2e7d3b28469081ccf08301df07cc411a1cc5e9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4689ba45296dbb3a47e70a1bc2ed0328263e48f3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87d2429381ddcf8cbd30c8c36793a4f7916d5f99", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9c61d8fe1350b7322f4953318165d6719c3b1475", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dfe28c4167a9259fc0c372d9f9473e1ac95cff67", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f95bef5ba0b88d971b02c776f24bd17544930a3a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
