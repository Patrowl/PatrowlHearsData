The problem occurs because these add-ons accept any password entered by the user and do not have an additional authentication or computer verification mechanism. Tests indicate that more than 1,000 systems use easy-to-guess passwords, many with less than 4 to 6 characters, including common sequences. This allows brute force attacks or trial-and-error attempts by malicious invaders. The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker who knows or can guess the password used in the connection. As a result, the attacker gains complete access to the affected system and can execute commands, modify files, and compromise user security."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.nvaccess.org"}, {"url": "https://github.com/azurejoga/CVE-2025-26326"}, {"url": "https://nvdaremote.com/"}, {"url": "https://github.com/NVDARemote/NVDARemote"}, {"url": "https://github.com/nvda-es/TeleNVDA"}, {"url": "https://nvda-addons.org/addon.php?id=270"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
