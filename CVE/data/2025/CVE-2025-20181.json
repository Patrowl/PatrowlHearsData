An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a crafted file into a specific location on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code at boot time.\r\n\r Because this allows the attacker to bypass a major security feature of the device, Cisco has raised the Security Impact Rating (SIR) of this advisory from Medium to High."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-c2960-3560-sboot-ZtqADrHq", "name": "cisco-sa-c2960-3560-sboot-ZtqADrHq"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-347"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"format": "cvssV3_0", "cvssV3_0": {"version": "3.0", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.0/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 6.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "PHYSICAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
