Possibly there were no users at that time, or the test cases were\ninsufficient to hit it.\n\nThe bug was then only noticed and fixed after\ncommit 9c2ba265352a (\"drm/scheduler: use new iterator in drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies v2\")\nlanded, with its fixup of\ncommit 4eaf02d6076c (\"drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies\").\n\nAt that point it was a slightly different flavour of a double free, which\ncommit 963d0b356935 (\"drm/scheduler: fix drm_sched_job_add_implicit_dependencies harder\")\nnoticed and attempted to fix.\n\nBut it only moved the double free from happening inside the\ndrm_sched_job_add_dependency(), when releasing the reference not yet\nobtained, to the caller, when releasing the reference already released by\nthe former in the failure case.\n\nAs such it is not easy to identify the right target for the fixes tag so\nlets keep it simple and just continue the chain.\n\nWhile fixing we also improve the comment and explain the reason for taking\nthe reference and not dropping it."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c38a63ae12ecc9370a7678077bde2d61aa80e9c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57239762aa90ad768dac055021f27705dae73344", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5801e65206b065b0b2af032f7f1eef222aa2fd83", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e5e3eb2aff92994ee81ce633f1c4e73bd4b87e11", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fdfb47e85af1e11ec822c82739dde2dd8dff5115", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
