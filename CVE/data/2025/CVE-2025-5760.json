When Detective Mode is enabled, the plugin\u2019s logger captures the entire contents of $_POST (and sometimes raw request bodies or $_GET) without redacting any password\u2010related keys. As a result, whenever a user submits a login form, whether via native wp_login or a third\u2010party login widget, their actual password is written in clear text into the logs. An authenticated attacker or any user whose actions generate a login event will have their password recorded; an administrator (or anyone with database read access) can then read those logs and retrieve every captured password."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/id/b6364415-da02-4236-b635-d8fbd27faa33?source=cve"}, {"url": "https://simple-history.com/support/detective-mode/"}, {"url": "https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-history/#developers"}, {"url": "https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/546"}, {"url": "https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/commit/68eab0cab6882eafef4bfece884093eeda5ac018"}, {"url": "https://wordpress.org/support/topic/security-vulnerability-passwords-stored-as-plain-text-in-logs/"}, {"url": "https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3267487/"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-256"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 4.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:eskapism:simple history \u2013 track, log, and audit wordpress changes:5.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
