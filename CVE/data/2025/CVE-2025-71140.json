This causes a big warning from the scheduler. This was first\nreported downstream on the ChromeOS kernels, but is also reproducible\non mainline using Fluster with the FFmpeg v4l2m2m decoders. Even though\nthe actual capture format is not supported, the affected code paths\nare triggered.\n\nSince this lock just protects the context list and operations on it are\nvery fast, it should be OK to switch to a spinlock."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c1ea6214827041f548279c9eda341eda0cc8351", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3e858938b0e659f6ec9ddcf853a87f1c5c3f44e1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5844227e0f030d2af2d85d4aed10c5eca6ca176", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b92c19675f632a41af1222027a231bc2b7efa7ed", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
