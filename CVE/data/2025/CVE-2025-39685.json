And it would still configure the\ndevice without interrupts even if the call to `request_irq` returned an\nerror.  So it would be better to combine this test with the test below."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0eb4ed2aa261dee228f1668dbfa6d87353e8162d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5a33d07c94ba91306093e823112a7aa9727549f6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/96cb948408b3adb69df7e451ba7da9d21f814d00", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a3cfcd0c78c80ca7cd80372dc28f77d01be57bf6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bab220b0bb5af652007e278e8e8357f952b0e1ea", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d8992c9a01f81128f36acb7c5755530e21fcd059", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
