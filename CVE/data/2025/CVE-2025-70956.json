The issue exists in the RUNVM instruction logic (VmState::run_child_vm), which is responsible for initializing child virtual machines. The operation moves critical resources (specifically libraries and log) from the parent state to a new child state in a non-atomic manner. If an Out-of-Gas (OOG) exception occurs after resources are moved but before the state transition is finalized, the parent VM retains a corrupted state where these resources are emptied/invalid. Because RUNVM supports gas isolation, the parent VM continues execution with this corrupted state, leading to unexpected behavior or denial of service within the contract's context."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://gist.github.com/Lucian-code233/beab9d14683ed2bdf5543be430b91c70", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/commit/1835d84602bbaaa1593270d7ab3bb0b499920416", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases/tag/v2025.04#:~:text=Arayz%2C%20Robinlzw%2C%20%40wy666444%20%40Lucian-code233", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZD35baKUikefFdtNHZIC9g", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
