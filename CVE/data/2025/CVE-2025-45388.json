Attackers can inject malicious code inside a PDF file. When a user clicks the document in the CMS interface, the payload executes. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because \"It has been well documented that when serving uploaded files using a method outside of Wagtail (which admittedly is the default), it requires additional configuration from the developer, because Wagtail cannot control how these are served. ... For example, if a Wagtail instance is configured to upload files into AWS S3, Wagtail cannot control the permissions on how they're served, nor any headers used when serving them (a limitation of S3).\""}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/echoBRT/Wagtail-CMS-XSS/"}, {"url": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Security-team"}, {"url": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/12617"}, {"url": "https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/deployment/under_the_hood.html#documents"}, {"url": "https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/12672"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
