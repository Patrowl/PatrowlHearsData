Versions prior to 1.3.3 are written in a way that is vulnerable to command injection vulnerability attacks as part of some of its MCP Server tool definition and implementation. The MCP Server exposes the tool `ui_tap` which relies on Node.js child process API `exec` which is an unsafe and vulnerable API if concatenated with untrusted user input. LLM exposed user input for `duration`, `udid`, and `x` and `y` args can be replaced with shell meta-characters like `;` or `&&` or others to change the behavior from running the expected command `idb` to another command. When LLMs are tricked through prompt injection (and other techniques and attack vectors) to call the tool with input that uses special shell characters such as `; rm -rf /tmp;#` and other payload variations, the full command-line text will be interepted by the shell and result in other commands except of `ps` executing on the host running the MCP Server. Version 1.3.3 contains a patch for the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-6f6r-m9pv-67jw", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/security/advisories/GHSA-6f6r-m9pv-67jw"}, {"name": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/commit/eb53a4f2cc8bbeb13e8d6d930f00167befcdb809", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/commit/eb53a4f2cc8bbeb13e8d6d930f00167befcdb809"}, {"name": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts#L166-L207", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts#L166-L207"}, {"name": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/releases/tag/v1.3.3", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp/releases/tag/v1.3.3"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-78"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 6, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
