The task that\nfailed undoes the effects of its attempt by (a) freeing the folio again\nand (b) putting the page back into the direct map.  However, by doing\nthese two operations in this order, the page becomes available to the\nallocator again before it is placed back in the direct mapping.\n\nIf another task attempts to allocate the page between (a) and (b), and the\nkernel tries to access it via the direct map, it would result in a\nsupervisor not-present page fault.\n\nFix the ordering to restore the direct map before the folio is freed."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1e4643d6628edf9c0047b1f8f5bc574665025acb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/42d486d35a4143cc37fc72ee66edc99d942dd367", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4444767e625da46009fc94a453fd1967b80ba047", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/52f2d5cf33de9a8f5e72bbb0ed38282ae0bc4649", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6f86d0534fddfbd08687fa0f01479d4226bc3c3d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bb1c19636aedae39360e6fdbcaef4f2bcff25785", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
