Unfortunately, op->max_freq is not valid\nwhen this function is called during probe but is instead zero.\nAccordingly, baud_rate_val is calculated to be INT_MAX due to division\nby zero, causing probe of the attached memory device to fail.\n\nSeemingly spi-microchip-core-qspi was the only driver that had such a\nmodification made to its supports_op callback when the per_op_freq\ncapability was added, so just remove it to restore prior functionality."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/89e7353f522f5cf70cb48c01ce2dcdcb275b8022", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ac8a13f35d5b8996582b3f97b924838a5c570c18", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
