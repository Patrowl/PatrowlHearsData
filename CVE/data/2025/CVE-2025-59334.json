Linkr versions through 2.0.0 do not verify the integrity or authenticity of .linkr manifest files before using their contents, allowing a tampered manifest to inject arbitrary file entries into a package distribution. An attacker can modify a generated .linkr manifest (for example by adding a new entry with a malicious URL) and when a user runs the extract command the client downloads the attacker-supplied file without verification. This enables arbitrary file injection and creates a potential path to remote code execution if a downloaded malicious binary or script is later executed. Version 2.0.1 adds a manifest integrity check that compares the checksum of the original author-created manifest to the one being extracted and aborts on mismatch, warning if no original manifest is hosted. Users should update to 2.0.1 or later. As a workaround prior to updating, use only trusted .linkr manifests, manually verify manifest integrity, and host manifests on trusted servers."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/commit/182e5ddaa51972e144005b500c4bcebf2fd1a6c0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/security/advisories/GHSA-6wph-mpv2-29xv", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/mohammadzain2008/Linkr/security/advisories/GHSA-6wph-mpv2-29xv", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-347"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 6.0, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.6, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
