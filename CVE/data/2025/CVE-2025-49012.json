Himmelblau versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.14 and 1.00-alpha are vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue when Entra ID group-based access restrictions are configured using group display names instead of object IDs. Starting in version 0.9.0, Himmelblau introduced support for specifying group names in the `pam_allow_groups` configuration option. However, Microsoft Entra ID permits the creation of multiple groups with the same `displayName` via the Microsoft Graph API\u2014even by non-admin users, depending on tenant settings. As a result, a user could create a personal group with the same name as a legitimate access group (e.g., `\"Allow-Linux-Login\"`), add themselves to it, and be granted authentication or `sudo` rights by Himmelblau. Because affected Himmelblau versions compare group names by either `displayName` or by the immutable `objectId`, this allows bypassing access control mechanisms intended to restrict login to members of official, centrally-managed groups. This issue is fixed in Himmelblau version **0.9.15** and later. In these versions, group name matching in `pam_allow_groups` has been deprecated and removed, and only group `objectId`s (GUIDs) may be specified for secure group-based filtering. To mitigate the issue without upgrading, replace all entries in `pam_allow_groups` with the objectId of the target Entra ID group(s) and/or audit your tenant for groups with duplicate display names using the Microsoft Graph API."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/security/advisories/GHSA-gcxr-m95v-qcf7", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/security/advisories/GHSA-gcxr-m95v-qcf7"}, {"name": "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/issues/554", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/issues/554"}, {"name": "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/commit/918577f6a8392a71d9d3d67f20962c372a0c01c6", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau/commit/918577f6a8392a71d9d3d67f20962c372a0c01c6"}, {"name": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1035045/azure-ad-b2c-creates-groups-with-the-same-name-usi?utm_source=chatgpt.com", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1035045/azure-ad-b2c-creates-groups-with-the-same-name-usi?utm_source=chatgpt.com"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-287"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
