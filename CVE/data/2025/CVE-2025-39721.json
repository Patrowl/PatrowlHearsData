This occurs when a power management (PM)\ninterrupt triggers just before the device-specific driver (e.g.,\nqat_4xxx.ko) is unloaded, while the core driver (intel_qat.ko) remains\nloaded.\n\nSince the driver uses a shared workqueue (`qat_misc_wq`) across all\ndevices and owned by intel_qat.ko, a deferred routine from the\ndevice-specific driver may still be pending in the queue. If this\nroutine executes after the driver is unloaded, it can dereference freed\nmemory, resulting in a page fault and kernel crash like the following:\n\n    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffa000002e50a01c\n    #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n    RIP: 0010:pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n    Call Trace:\n      pm_bh_handler+0x1d2/0x250 [intel_qat]\n      process_one_work+0x171/0x340\n      worker_thread+0x277/0x3a0\n      kthread+0xf0/0x120\n      ret_from_fork+0x2d/0x50\n\nTo prevent this, flush the misc workqueue during device shutdown to\nensure that all pending work items are completed before the driver is\nunloaded.\n\nNote: This approach may slightly increase shutdown latency if the\nworkqueue contains jobs from other devices, but it ensures correctness\nand stability."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3d4df408ba9bad2b205c7fb8afc1836a6a4ca88a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5858448a6c65d8ee3f8600570d3ce19febcb33be", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e59a52e429e13df3feb34f4853a8e36d121ed937", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe546f5c50fc474daca6bee72caa7ab68a74c33d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
