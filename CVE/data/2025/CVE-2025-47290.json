A time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability was found in containerd v2.1.0. While unpacking an image during an image pull, specially crafted container images could arbitrarily modify the host file system. The only affected version of containerd is 2.1.0.  Other versions of containerd are not affected. This bug has been fixed in containerd 2.1.1. Users should update to this version to resolve the issue. As a workaround, ensure that only trusted images are used and that only trusted users have permissions to import images."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-cm76-qm8v-3j95", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-cm76-qm8v-3j95"}, {"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cada13298fba85493badb6fecb6ccf80e49673cc", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/commit/cada13298fba85493badb6fecb6ccf80e49673cc"}, {"name": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.1.1", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.1.1"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-367"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackRequirements": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "ACTIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "subIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "subAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.6, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:U", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
