Prior to commit e6b4271, a command injection vulnerability was discovered in the discussion-to-slack.yml GitHub Actions workflow. Untrusted discussion fields (title, body, etc.) were directly interpolated into shell commands in a run: block. An attacker could craft a malicious GitHub Discussion title or body (e.g., $(curl ...)) to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Actions runner. This issue has been fixed in commit e6b4271 where the discussion-to-slack.yml workflow was removed. Users should remove the discussion-to-slack.yml workflow if using a fork or derivative of this repository."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-432r-9455-7f9x", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-432r-9455-7f9x"}, {"name": "https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/commit/e6b427150b35e97a089ea10409de8c5c52f8a7b9", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/gluestack/gluestack-ui/commit/e6b427150b35e97a089ea10409de8c5c52f8a7b9"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-77"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 9.1, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
