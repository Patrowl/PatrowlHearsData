In versions on the 3.x branch prior to 3.6.0, `libparsec_crypto`, a component of the Parsec application, does not check for weak order point of Curve25519 when compiled with its RustCrypto backend. In practice this means an attacker in a man-in-the-middle position would be able to provide weak order points to both parties in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, resulting in a high probability to for both parties to obtain the same shared key (hence leading to a successful SAS code exchange, misleading both parties into thinking no MITM has occurred) which is also known by the attacker. Note only Parsec web is impacted (as Parsec desktop uses `libparsec_crypto` with the libsodium backend). Version 3.6.0 of Parsec patches the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/blob/e7c5cdbc4234f606ccf3ab2be7e9edc22db16feb/libparsec/crates/crypto/src/rustcrypto/private.rs#L136-L138", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/commit/197bb6387b49fec872b5e4a04dcdb82b3d2995b2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/Scille/parsec-cloud/security/advisories/GHSA-hrc9-gm58-pgj9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/8c53a8f10b146a2fd65069437e3576e49b390e7a/curve25519-dalek/src/montgomery.rs#L132-L146", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/curve25519-dalek/blob/8c53a8f10b146a2fd65069437e3576e49b390e7a/x25519-dalek/src/x25519.rs#L364-L366", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-327"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-1240"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.5, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "LOW"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
