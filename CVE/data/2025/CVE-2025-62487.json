The regression was traced back to a change in May 2025, which was meant to allow file uploads to be shared among different artifacts (e.g. other dossiers and presentations).\n\nOn deployments configured with CBAC, the front-end would present a security picker dialog to set the security level on the uploads, thereby mitigating the issue.\n\nOn deployments without a CBAC configuration, no security picker dialog appears, leading to a security level of CUSTOM with no markings or datasets selected. The resulting markings and groups for the file uploads thus will be only those added by the \u201cDefault authorization rules\u201d defined in the Auth Chooser configuration. On most environments, it is expected that the \u201cDefault authorization rules\" only add the Everyone group."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://palantir.safebase.us/?tcuUid=c91a1b4f-72e7-4959-9e2d-3a341e5c7a1f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-863"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.1, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N", "baseScore": 3.5, "baseSeverity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
