Unfortunately as of today the s390/ism driver in Linux does not\nhonor that requirement. This patch aims to rectify that.\n\nThis problem was discovered based on Aliaksei's bug report which states\nthat for certain workloads the ISM functions end up entering error state\n(with PEC 2 as seen from the logs) after a while and as a consequence\nconnections handled by the respective function break, and for future\nconnection requests the ISM device is not considered -- given it is in a\ndysfunctional state. During further debugging PEC 3A was observed as\nwell.\n\nA kernel message like\n[ 1211.244319] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: Event 0x2 reports an error for PCI function 0x61a\nis a reliable indicator of the stated function entering error state\nwith PEC 2. Let me also point out that a kernel message like\n[ 1211.244325] zpci: 061a:00:00.0: The ism driver bound to the device does not support error recovery\nis a reliable indicator that the ISM function won't be auto-recovered\nbecause the ISM driver currently lacks support for it.\n\nOn a technical level, without this synchronization, commands (inputs to\nthe FW) may be partially or fully overwritten (corrupted) by another CPU\ntrying to issue commands on the same function. There is hard evidence that\nthis can lead to DMB token values being used as DMB IOVAs, leading to\nPEC 2 PCI events indicating invalid DMA. But this is only one of the\nfailure modes imaginable. In theory even completely losing one command\nand executing another one twice and then trying to interpret the outputs\nas if the command we intended to execute was actually executed and not\nthe other one is also possible.  Frankly, I don't feel confident about\nproviding an exhaustive list of possible consequences."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/faf44487dfc80817f178dc8de7a0b73f960d019b"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1194ad0d44d66b273a02a3a22882dc863a68d764"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fafaa4982bedb5532f5952000f714a3e63023f40"}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/897e8601b9cff1d054cdd53047f568b0e1995726"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.12.*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.15.*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:6.6.*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:faf44487dfc80817f178dc8de7a0b73f960d019b:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:4.19:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:897e8601b9cff1d054cdd53047f568b0e1995726:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:fafaa4982bedb5532f5952000f714a3e63023f40:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:1194ad0d44d66b273a02a3a22882dc863a68d764:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
