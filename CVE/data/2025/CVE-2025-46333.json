Versions of z2d after `0.5.1` and up to and including `0.6.0`, when writing from one surface to another using `z2d.compositor.StrideCompositor.run`, and higher-level operations when the anti-aliasing mode is set to `.default` (such as `Context.fill`, `Context.stroke`, `painter.fill`, and `painter.stroke`), the source surface can be completely out-of-bounds on the x-axis, but not on the y-axis, by way of a negative offset. This results in an overflow of the value controlling the length of the stride. In non-safe optimization modes (consumers compiling with `ReleaseFast` or `ReleaseSmall`), this could potentially lead to invalid memory accesses or corruption.\n\nThis issue is patched in version `0.6.1`. Users on an untagged version after `v0.5.1` and before `v0.6.1` are advised to update to address the vulnerability. Those still on Zig `0.13.0` are recommended to downgrade to `v0.5.1`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/security/advisories/GHSA-mm4c-p35v-7hx3", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/security/advisories/GHSA-mm4c-p35v-7hx3"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/104", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/104"}, {"name": "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/105", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/vancluever/z2d/issues/105"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-119"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-122"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-190"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV4": {"cvssV4": {"cvssV4_0": {"attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "attackRequirements": "PRESENT", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "PASSIVE", "vulnConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "vulnAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "subConfidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "subIntegrityImpact": "HIGH", "subAvailabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "vectorString": "CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:P/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H", "version": "4.0"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
