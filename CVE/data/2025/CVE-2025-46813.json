A data leak vulnerability affects sites deployed between commits 10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510 and 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b. On login-required sites, the leak meant that some content on the site's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users. Only login-required sites that got deployed during this timeframe are affected, roughly between April 30 2025 noon EDT and May 2 2025, noon EDT. Sites on the stable branch are unaffected. Private content on an instance's homepage could be visible to unauthenticated users on login-required sites. Versions of 3.5.0.beta4 after commit 82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b are not vulnerable to the issue. No workarounds are available. Sites must upgrade to a non-vulnerable version of Discourse."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-v3h7-c287-pfg9", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/security/advisories/GHSA-v3h7-c287-pfg9"}, {"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/10df7fdee060d44accdee7679d66d778d1136510"}, {"name": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/82d84af6b0efbd9fa2aeec3e91ce7be1a768511b"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-200"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.8, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
