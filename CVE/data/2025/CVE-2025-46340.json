Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-3p2w-xmv5-jm95", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/security/advisories/GHSA-3p2w-xmv5-jm95"}, {"name": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/d10fdfe9738b17a9d81037c031b40a2cc4cb8038", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/d10fdfe9738b17a9d81037c031b40a2cc4cb8038"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}, {"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-116"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.2, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
