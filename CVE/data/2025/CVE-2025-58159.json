Prior to version 3.4.11, a remote code execution vulnerability was identified, caused by improper validation of uploaded files. The application allows an attacker to upload files with arbitrary filenames, including those with a .php extension. Because the uploaded file is written directly to disk without adequate sanitization or extension restrictions, a spreadsheet file followed by PHP code can be uploaded and executed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is due to insufficient mitigation of CVE-2025-22133. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.11."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/LabRedesCefetRJ/WeGIA/security/advisories/GHSA-wj2c-237g-cgqp", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Vendor Advisory", "Exploit"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-94"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-434"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:wegia:wegia:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "22D1939A-3E87-4F0A-BC4D-0AFBAA16A566", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndExcluding": "3.4.11"}]}]}}
