Dependency-Track allows users with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to customize notification templates. Templates are evaluated using the Pebble template engine. Pebble supports an `include` tag, which allows template authors to include the content of arbitrary files upon evaluation. Prior to version 4.12.6, users of Dependency-Track with the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission can abuse the `include` tag by crafting notification templates that `include` sensitive local files, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/proc/1/environ`. By configuring such a template for a notification rule (aka \"Alert\"), and having it send notifications to a destination controlled by the actor, sensitive information may be leaked. The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.12.6. In fixed versions, the `include` tag can no longer be used. Usage of the tag will cause template evaluation to fail. As a workaround, avoid assigning the `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission to untrusted users. The `SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION` permission per default is only granted to members of the `Administrators` team. Assigning this permission to non-administrative users or teams is a security risk in itself, and highly discouraged."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-9582-88hr-54w3", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/security/advisories/GHSA-9582-88hr-54w3"}, {"name": "https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-p75g-cxfj-7wrx", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-p75g-cxfj-7wrx"}, {"name": "https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/680", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/PebbleTemplates/pebble/issues/680"}, {"name": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4684", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4684"}, {"name": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4685", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/4685"}, {"name": "https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/include", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://pebbletemplates.io/wiki/tag/include"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-73"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
