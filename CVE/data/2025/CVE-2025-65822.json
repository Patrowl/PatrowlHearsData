By leaving JTAG enabled on an ESP32 in a commercial product an attacker with physical access to the device can connect over this port and reflash the device's firmware with malicious code which will be executed upon running. As a result, the victim will lose access to the functionality of their device and the attack may gain unauthorized access to the victim's Wi-Fi network by re-connecting to the SSID defined in the NVS partition of the device."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://gist.github.com/dead1nfluence/4dffc239b4a460f41a03345fd8e5feb5#file-jtag-enabled-md", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/dead1nfluence/Meatmeet-Pro-Vulnerabilities/blob/main/Device/JTAG-Enabled.md", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
