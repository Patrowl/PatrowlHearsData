From versions 0.10.2 to before 0.11.1, a memory corruption vulnerability could lead to a crash (denial-of-service) and potentially remote code execution (RCE), exists in the Completions API endpoint. When processing user-supplied prompt embeddings, the endpoint loads serialized tensors using torch.load() without sufficient validation. Due to a change introduced in PyTorch 2.8.0, sparse tensor integrity checks are disabled by default. As a result, maliciously crafted tensors can bypass internal bounds checks and trigger an out-of-bounds memory write during the call to to_dense(). This memory corruption can crash vLLM and potentially lead to code execution on the server hosting vLLM. This issue has been patched in version 0.11.1."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/commit/58fab50d82838d5014f4a14d991fdb9352c9c84b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/27204", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/security/advisories/GHSA-mrw7-hf4f-83pf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-123"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-502"}, {"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-787"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.9, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
