This timing difference can be used to enumerate valid usernames, after which an attacker could attempt brute force attacks.\n\nPatchesThis vulnerability has been patched, implementing a timing-safe form login authenticator that ensures consistent response times regardless of whether a user exists or not.\n\nTechnical DetailsThe vulnerability was caused by different response times when:\n\n  *  A valid username was provided (password hashing occurred)\n  *  An invalid username was provided (no password hashing occurred)\n\n\nThe fix introduces a TimingSafeFormLoginAuthenticator\u00a0that performs a dummy password hash verification even for non-existent users, ensuring consistent timing.\n\nWorkaroundsNo workarounds are available. Users should upgrade to the patched version.\n\nReferences  *   https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-3ggv-qwcp-j6xg", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-204"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 5.9, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
