This breaks the\nassumption and causes two related WARN_ON_ONCE checks to trigger.\n\nTo fix this, the runtime checks are adjusted to silently ignore any lock\nthat is not 4-byte aligned, effectively disabling the feature in such\ncases and avoiding the related warnings.\n\nThanks to Geert Uytterhoeven for bisecting!"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c0e2dcbe54cb15ecdf9d8f4501c6720423243888", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c97513cddcfc235f2522617980838e500af21d01", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
