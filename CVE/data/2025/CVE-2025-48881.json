In versions starting from 11.0.0.RELEASE to 11.3.3.RELEASE and 12.0.0.RELEASE to 12.12.0.RELEASE, all objects for which an object-management configuration exists can be listed, viewed, edited, created or deleted by unauthorised users. If object-urls are exposed via other channels, the contents of these objects can be viewed independent of object-management configurations. This issue has been patched in version 12.13.0.RELEASE.  A workaround for this issue involves overriding the endpoint security as defined in ObjectenApiHttpSecurityConfigurer and ObjectManagementHttpSecurityConfigurer. Depending on the implementation, this could result in loss of functionality."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"name": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p", "tags": ["x_refsource_CONFIRM"], "url": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/security/advisories/GHSA-965r-9cg9-g42p"}, {"name": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/6ab04b30d3dab816bfea32d40ba50e5dd4517272", "tags": ["x_refsource_MISC"], "url": "https://github.com/valtimo-platform/valtimo-backend-libraries/commit/6ab04b30d3dab816bfea32d40ba50e5dd4517272"}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-863"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"cvssV3_1": {"attackComplexity": "LOW", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 8.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "userInteraction": "NONE", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L", "version": "3.1"}}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": []}]}}
