(i.e. user-submitted HTTP/HTTPS requests reach Solr as-is, unmodified or restricted by any intervening proxy or gateway)\n\nUsers can mitigate this vulnerability by ensuring that their RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin configuration specifies the \"all\" pre-defined permission and associates the permission with an \"admin\" or other privileged role.\u00a0 Users can also upgrade to a Solr version outside of the impacted range, such as the recently released Solr 9.10.1."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/d59hqbgo7p62myq7mgfpz7or8n1j7wbn", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Vendor Advisory"]}, {"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/20/4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-285"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 4.2, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 8.2, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:apache:solr:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "2F2760AF-9E4B-4552-847C-DE58D908164F", "cpe_name": [], "versionStartIncluding": "5.3.0", "versionEndExcluding": "9.10.1"}]}]}}
