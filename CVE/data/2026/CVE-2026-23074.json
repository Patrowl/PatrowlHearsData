In the meantime, a second packet is sent and it lands on\n1:2. teql's enqueue will return success and this will activate class 1:2.\nMain issue is that teql only updates the parent visible qlen (sch->q.qlen)\nat dequeue. Since QFQ will only call dequeue if peek succeeds (and teql's\npeek always returns NULL), dequeue will never be called and thus the qlen\nwill remain as 0. With that in mind, when GangMin updates 1:2's lmax value,\nthe qfq_change_class calls qfq_deact_rm_from_agg. Since the child qdisc's\nqlen was not incremented, qfq fails to deactivate the class, but still\nfrees its pointers from the aggregate. So when the first packet is\nrescheduled after 6.4 seconds (netem's delay), a dangling pointer is\naccessed causing GangMin's causing a UAF."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0686bedfed34155520f3f735cbf3210cb9044380", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16ed73c1282d376b956bff23e5139add061767ba", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c7e8aa71c9232cba84c289b4b56cba80b280841", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50da4b9d07a7a463e2cfb738f3ad4cff6b2c9c3b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/73d970ff0eddd874a84c953387c7f4464b705fc6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae810e6a8ac4fe25042e6825d2a401207a2e41fb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dad49a67c2d817bfec98e6e45121b351e3a0202c", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
