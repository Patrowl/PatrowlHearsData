While both tcp and udp\nstack do call nf_reset_ct() before placing skb on socket queue, that\nfunction doesn't iterate frag_list skbs.\n\nTherefore drop nf_conn entries when they are placed in defrag queue.\nKeep the nf_conn entry of the first (offset 0) skb so that reassembled\nskb retains nf_conn entry for sake of TX path.\n\nNote that fixes tag is incorrect; it points to the commit introducing the\n'ip_defrag.sh reproducible problem': no need to backport this patch to\nevery stable kernel."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/088ca99dbb039c444c3ff987c5412a73f4f0cbf8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2ef02ac38d3c17f34a00c4b267d961a8d4b45d1a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
