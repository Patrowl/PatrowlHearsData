In versions 5.5.2, 5.4.3, 5.3.4, 5.2.6, and 5.1.6, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability was reported in the BLE ATT Prepare Write handling of the BLE provisioning transport (protocomm_ble). The issue can be triggered by a remote BLE client while the device is in provisioning mode. The transport accumulated prepared-write fragments in a fixed-size buffer but incorrectly tracked the cumulative length. By sending repeated prepare write requests with overlapping offsets, a remote client could cause the reported length to exceed the allocated buffer size. This inflated length was then passed to provisioning handlers during execute-write processing, resulting in an out-of-bounds read and potential memory corruption. This issue has been patched in versions 5.5.3, 5.4.4, 5.3.5, 5.2.7, and 5.1.7."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/0540c85140c2c06c0cbecc8843277ea676d5c4a9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/1ff264abf2504cade46f0ce3a03f821310bcf6d7", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/47552ff4fd824caf38215468ebd2f31fb5f36d70", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/4c3fdcd316f780bab4ae5aa73c9626ea9fe24ac6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/894c28afe3f2f8f31ff25b64191883517dddb5cf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/cde7b7362adc15638c141c249681cbe5d23de663", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/dba9a7dc01e4dab14c77d328f6a6f46369aeee63", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/security/advisories/GHSA-9j5x-rf36-54x9", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-125"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.1, "impactScore": 4.2, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "baseScore": 6.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "ADJACENT_NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
