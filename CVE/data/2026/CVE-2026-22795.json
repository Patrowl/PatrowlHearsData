Exploiting this issue also requires a user or application\nto process a maliciously crafted PKCS#12 file. It is uncommon to accept\nuntrusted PKCS#12 files in applications as they are usually used to store\nprivate keys which are trusted by definition. For these reasons, the issue\nwas assessed as Low severity.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.5, 3.4, 3.3 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue,\nas the PKCS12 implementation is outside the OpenSSL FIPS module boundary.\n\nOpenSSL 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 3.3, 3.0 and 1.1.1 are vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 is not affected by this issue."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2502e7b7d4c0cf4f972a881641fe09edc67aeec4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/572844beca95068394c916626a6d3a490f831a49", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7bbca05be55b129651d9df4bdb92becc45002c12", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/eeee3cbd4d682095ed431052f00403004596373e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/ef2fb66ec571564d64d1c74a12e388a2a54d05d2", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20260127.txt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-754"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
