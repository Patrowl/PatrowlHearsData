The communication with the XPC service of the privileged helper is only allowed if the client process is signed with the corresponding certificate and fulfills the following code signing requirement:\n\"anchor trusted and certificate leaf[subject.CN] = \\\"Developer ID Application: Native Instruments GmbH (83K5EG6Z9V)\\\"\"\n\nThe Native Access application was found to be signed with the `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` entitlements leading to DYLIB injection and therefore command execution in the context of this application. A low privileged user can exploit the DYLIB injection to trigger functions of the privileged helper XPC service resulting in privilege escalation by first deleting the /etc/sudoers file and then copying a malicious version of that file to /etc/sudoers."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-native-instruments-native-access-macos/", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-426"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.0, "impactScore": 6.0, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 8.8, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:native-instruments:native_access:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "2D0299D5-FF09-4EE2-8F1D-E2FC624D27DB", "cpe_name": [], "versionEndIncluding": "3.22.0"}]}, {"operator": "OR", "negate": false, "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": false, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:apple:macos:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "matchCriteriaId": "387021A0-AF36-463C-A605-32EA7DAC172E", "cpe_name": []}]}]}}
