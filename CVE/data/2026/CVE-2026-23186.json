To prevent that from happening, add a\nnew lock serializing the execution of the switch () statement in\nacpi_power_meter_notify().  For simplicity, it is a static mutex\nwhich should not be a problem from the performance perspective.\n\nThe new lock also allows the hwmon_device_register_with_info()\nin acpi_power_meter_notify() to be called outside the inner lock\nbecause it prevents the other notifications handled by that function\nfrom manipulating the \"resource\" object while the hwmon device based\non it is being registered.  The sending of ACPI netlink messages from\nacpi_power_meter_notify() is serialized by the new lock too which\ngenerally helps to ensure that the order of handling firmware\nnotifications is the same as the order of sending netlink messages\nrelated to them.\n\nIn addition, notice that hwmon_device_register_with_info() may fail\nin which case resource->hwmon_dev will become an error pointer,\nso add checks to avoid attempting to unregister the hwmon device\npointer to by it in that case to acpi_power_meter_notify() and\nacpi_power_meter_remove()."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/615901b57b7ef8eb655f71358f7e956e42bcd16b", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8860ddf0e07be37169d4ef9f2618e39fca934a66", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
