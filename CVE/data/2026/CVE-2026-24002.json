Grist offers several methods for running those formulas in a sandbox, for cases where the user may be working with untrusted spreadsheets. One such method runs them in pyodide, but pyodide on node does not have a useful sandbox barrier. If a user of Grist sets `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` to `pyodide` and opens a malicious document, that document could run arbitrary processes on the server hosting Grist. The problem has been addressed in Grist version 1.7.9 and up, by running pyodide under deno. As a workaround, a user can use the gvisor-based sandbox by setting  `GRIST_SANDBOX_FLAVOR` to `gvisor`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/security/advisories/GHSA-7xvx-8pf2-pv5g", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://support.getgrist.com/self-managed/#how-do-i-sandbox-documents", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-74"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.2, "impactScore": 6.0, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "baseScore": 9.0, "baseSeverity": "CRITICAL", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
