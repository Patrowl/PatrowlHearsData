Following trace is from an error in the\ninit_task where the CREATE_VPORT (op 501) is rejected by the FW:\n\n[40922.763136] idpf 0000:83:00.0: Device HW Reset initiated\n[40924.449797] idpf 0000:83:00.0: Transaction failed (op 501)\n[40958.148190] idpf 0000:83:00.0: HW reset detected\n[40958.161202] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000a8\n...\n[40958.168094] Workqueue: idpf-0000:83:00.0-vc_event idpf_vc_event_task [idpf]\n[40958.168865] RIP: 0010:idpf_vc_event_task+0x9b/0x350 [idpf]\n...\n[40958.177932] Call Trace:\n[40958.178491]  <TASK>\n[40958.179040]  process_one_work+0x226/0x6d0\n[40958.179609]  worker_thread+0x19e/0x340\n[40958.180158]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n[40958.180702]  kthread+0x10f/0x250\n[40958.181238]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n[40958.181774]  ret_from_fork+0x251/0x2b0\n[40958.182307]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n[40958.182834]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n[40958.183370]  </TASK>\n\nFix the error handling in the init_task to make sure the service and\nmailbox tasks are disabled if the error happens during load. These are\nstarted in idpf_vc_core_init(), which spawns the init_task and has no way\nof knowing if it failed. If the error happens on reset, following\nsuccessful driver load, the tasks can still run, as that will allow the\nnetdevs to attempt recovery through another reset.
