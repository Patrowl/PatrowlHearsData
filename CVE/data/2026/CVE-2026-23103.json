So\n\n1) Introduce per-port addrs_lock.\n\n2) It was needed to fix places where it was forgotten\nto take lock (ipvlan_open/ipvlan_close)\n\nThis appears to be a very minor problem though.\nSince it's highly unlikely that ipvlan_add_addr() will\nbe called on 2 CPU simultaneously. But nevertheless,\nthis could cause:\n\n1) False-negative of ipvlan_addr_busy(): one interface\niterated through all port->ipvlans + ipvlan->addrs\nunder some ipvlan spinlock, and another added IP\nunder its own lock. Though this is only possible\nfor IPv6, since looks like only ipvlan_addr6_event() can be\ncalled without rtnl_lock.\n\n2) Race since ipvlan_ht_addr_add(port) is called under\ndifferent ipvlan->addrs_lock locks\n\nThis should not affect performance, since add/remove IP\nis a rare situation and spinlock is not taken on fast\npaths."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/04ba6de6eff61238e5397c14ac26a6578c7735a5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1f300c10d92c547c3a7d978e1212ff52f18256ed", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a81e2db096913d7e43aada1c350c1282e76db39", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3ba32162488283c0a4c5bedd8817aec91748802", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
