For this we\nadd a new flag protected with nn->client_lock.  It is set only while it\nis safe to make client tracking calls, and v4_end_grace only schedules\nwork while the flag is set with the spinlock held.\n\nSo this patch adds a nfsd_net field \"client_tracking_active\" which is\nset as described.  Another field \"grace_end_forced\", is set when\nv4_end_grace is written.  After this is set, and providing\nclient_tracking_active is set, the laundromat is scheduled.\nThis \"grace_end_forced\" field bypasses other checks for whether the\ngrace period has finished.\n\nThis resolves a race which can result in use-after-free."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/06600719d0f7a723811c45e4d51f5b742f345309", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2857bd59feb63fcf40fe4baf55401baea6b4feb4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/34eb22836e0cdba093baac66599d68c4cd245a9d", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/53f07d095e7e680c5e4569a55a019f2c0348cdc6", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba4811c8b433bfa681729ca42cc62b6034f223b0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca97360860eb02e3ae4ba42c19b439a0fcecbf06", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e8bfa2401d4c51eca6e48e9b33c798828ca9df61", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
