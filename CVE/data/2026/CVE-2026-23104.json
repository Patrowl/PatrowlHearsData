As a\nresult if devlink reload is used to reinit the device and then the driver\nis removed, a call trace can occur.\n\nBUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc0fd4b5d\nCall Trace:\n string+0x48/0xe0\n vsnprintf+0x1f9/0x650\n sprintf+0x62/0x80\n name_show+0x1f/0x30\n dev_attr_show+0x19/0x60\n\nThe call trace repeats approximately every 10 minutes when system\nmonitoring tools (e.g., sadc) attempt to read the orphaned hwmon sysfs\nattributes that reference freed module memory.\n\nThe sequence is:\n1. Driver load, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from ice_init_feature()\n2. Devlink reload down, flow does not call ice_remove()\n3. Devlink reload up, ice_hwmon_init() gets called from\n   ice_init_feature() resulting in a second instance\n4. Driver unload, ice_hwmon_exit() called from ice_remove() leaving the\n   first hwmon instance orphaned with dangling pointer\n\nFix this by moving ice_hwmon_exit() from ice_remove() to\nice_deinit_features() to ensure proper cleanup symmetry with\nice_hwmon_init()."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87c1dacca197cc64e06fedeb269e3dd6699bae60", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d3f867e7a04678640ebcbfb81893c59f4af48586", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
