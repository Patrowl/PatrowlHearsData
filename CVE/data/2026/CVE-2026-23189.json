Note that the `-o mds_namespace=foo` should only be used for\nselecting the file system to mount and nothing else. It's possible\nno mds_namespace is specified but the kernel will mount the only\nfile system that exists which may have name \"foo\".\n\nThis patch reworks ceph_mdsmap_decode() and namespace_equals() with\nthe goal of supporting the suggested concept. Now struct ceph_mdsmap\ncontains m_fs_name field that receives copy of extracted FS name\nby ceph_extract_encoded_string(). For the case of \"old\" CephFS file\nsystems, it is used \"cephfs\" name.\n\n[ idryomov: replace redundant %*pE with %s in ceph_mdsmap_decode(),\n  get rid of a series of strlen() calls in ceph_namespace_match(),\n  drop changes to namespace_equals() body to avoid treating empty\n  mds_namespace as equal, drop changes to ceph_mdsc_handle_fsmap()\n  as namespace_equals() isn't an equivalent substitution there ]"}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/57b36ffc8881dd455d875f85c105901974af2130", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7987cce375ac8ce98e170a77aa2399f2cf6eb99f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6f8326f26bd20d648d9a55afd68148d1b6afe28", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
