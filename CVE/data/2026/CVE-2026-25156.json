HotCRP versions from October 2025 through January 2026 delivered documents of all types with inline Content-Disposition, causing them to be rendered in the user\u2019s browser rather than downloaded. (The intended behavior was for only `text/plain`, `application/pdf`, `image/gif`, `image/jpeg`, and `image/png` to be delivered inline, though adding `save=0` to the document URL could request inline delivery for any document.) This made users who clicked a document link vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. An uploaded HTML or SVG document would run in the viewer\u2019s browser with access to their HotCRP credentials, and Javascript in that document could eventually make arbitrary calls to HotCRP\u2019s API. Malicious documents could be uploaded to submission fields with \u201cfile upload\u201d or \u201cattachment\u201d type, or as attachments to comments. PDF upload fields were not vulnerable. A search of documents uploaded to hotcrp.com found no evidence of exploitation. The vulnerability was introduced in commit aa20ef288828b04550950cf67c831af8a525f508 (11 October 2025), present in development versions and v3.2, and fixed in commit 8933e86c9f384b356dc4c6e9e2814dee1074b323 and v3.2.1. Additionally, c3d88a7e18d52119c65df31c2cc994edd2beccc5 and v3.2.1 remove support for `save=0`."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/commit/8933e86c9f384b356dc4c6e9e2814dee1074b323", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/commit/aa20ef288828b04550950cf67c831af8a525f508", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/commit/c3d88a7e18d52119c65df31c2cc994edd2beccc5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/security/advisories/GHSA-p88p-2f2p-2476", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-79"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.1, "impactScore": 5.2, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
