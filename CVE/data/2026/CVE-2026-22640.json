This vulnerability exists in the DELETE /api/org/users/ endpoint. The vulnerability can be exploited when: 1. An Organization administrator exists 2. The Server administrator is either: - Not part of any organization, or - Part of the same organization as the Organization administrator Impact: - Organization administrators can permanently delete Server administrator accounts - If the only Server administrator is deleted, the Grafana instance becomes unmanageable - No super-user permissions remain in the system - Affects all users, organizations, and teams managed in the instance The vulnerability is particularly serious as it can lead to a complete loss of administrative control over the Grafana instance."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://sick.com/psirt", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/ics-recommended-practices", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.json", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.sick.com/.well-known/csaf/white/2026/sca-2026-0002.pdf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://www.sick.com/media/docs/9/19/719/special_information_sick_operating_guidelines_cybersecurity_by_sick_en_im0106719.pdf", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-284"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 4.2, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H", "baseScore": 5.5, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
