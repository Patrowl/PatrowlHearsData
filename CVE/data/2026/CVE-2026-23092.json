The code incorrectly uses 'count'\nas the index for null termination instead of the actual bytes copied.\nIf count exceeds the buffer size, this leads to out-of-bounds write.\nAdd a check for the count and use the return value as the index.\n\nThe bug was validated using a demo module that mirrors the original\ncode and was tested under QEMU.\n\nPattern of the bug:\n- A fixed 64-byte stack buffer is filled using count.\n- If count > 64, the code still does buf[count] = '\\0', causing an\n- out-of-bounds write on the stack.\n\nSteps for reproduce:\n- Opens the device node.\n- Writes 128 bytes of A to it.\n- This overflows the 64-byte stack buffer and KASAN reports the OOB.\n\nFound via static analysis.
