Since all memory below\nthe 4GB physical address limit is in ZONE_DMA in this configuration,\nkmalloc() defaults to higher addresses for ZONE_NORMAL, and the\nITS driver stores the physical address in a 32-bit 'unsigned long'\nvariable.\n\nChange the itt_addr variable to the correct phys_addr_t type instead,\nalong with all other variables in this driver that hold a physical\naddress.\n\nThe gicv5 driver correctly uses u64 variables, while all other irqchip\ndrivers don't call virt_to_phys or similar interfaces. It's expected that\nother device drivers have similar issues, but fixing this one is\nsufficient for booting a virtio based guest."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/03faa61eb4b9ca9aa09bd91d4c3773d8e7b1ac98", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/084ba3b99f2dfd991ce7e84fb17117319ec3cd9f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b323391560354d8c515de8658b057a1daa82adb", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d76a7d89c12d08382b66e2f21f20d0627d14859", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
