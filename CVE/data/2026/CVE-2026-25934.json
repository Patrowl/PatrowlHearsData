Prior to 5.16.5, a vulnerability was discovered in go-git whereby data integrity values for .pack and .idx files were not properly verified. This resulted in go-git potentially consuming corrupted files, which would likely result in unexpected errors such as object not found. For context, clients fetch packfiles from upstream Git servers. Those files contain a checksum of their contents, so that clients can perform integrity checks before consuming it. The pack indexes (.idx) are generated locally by go-git, or the git cli, when new .pack files are received and processed. The integrity checks for both files were not being verified correctly. This vulnerability is fixed in 5.16.5."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/go-git/go-git/releases/tag/v5.16.5", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/go-git/go-git/security/advisories/GHSA-37cx-329c-33x3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-354"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 1.4, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N", "baseScore": 4.3, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
