Also make sure endpoint is\nrunning before attempting to stop it.\n\nRemove the xhci_initialize_ring_info() call during sideband endpoint\nremoval as is it only initializes ring structure enqueue, dequeue and\ncycle state values to their starting values without changing actual\nhardware enqueue, dequeue and cycle state. Leaving them out of sync\nis worse than leaving it as it is. The endpoint will get freed in after\nthis in most usecases.\n\nIf the (audio) class driver want's to reuse the endpoint after offload\nthen it is up to the class driver to ensure endpoint is properly set up."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/34f6634dba87ef72b3c3a3a524be663adef7ab42", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd83dc1249737b837ac5d57c81f2b0977c613d9f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
