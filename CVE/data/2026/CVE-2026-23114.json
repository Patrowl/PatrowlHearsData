This can result in a later warning from\nfpsimd_restore_current_state(), e.g.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 7214 at arch/arm64/kernel/fpsimd.c:383 fpsimd_restore_current_state+0x50c/0x748\n\nWhen this happens, fpsimd_restore_current_state() will set TIF_SVE,\nplacing the task into the correct state. This occurs before any other\ncheck of TIF_SVE can possibly occur, as other checks of TIF_SVE only\nhappen while the FPSIMD/SVE/SME state is live. Thus, aside from the\nwarning, there is no functional issue.\n\nThis bug was introduced during rework to error handling in commit:\n\n  9f8bf718f2923 (\"arm64/fpsimd: ptrace: Gracefully handle errors\")\n\n... where the setting of TIF_SVE was moved into a block which is only\nexecuted when system_supports_sme() is true.\n\nFix this by removing the system_supports_sme() check. This ensures that\nTIF_SVE is set for (SVE-formatted) writes to NT_ARM_SVE, at the cost of\nunconditionally manipulating the tracee's saved svcr value. The\nmanipulation of svcr is benign and inexpensive, and we already do\nsimilar elsewhere (e.g. during signal handling), so I don't think it's\nworth guarding this with system_supports_sme() checks.\n\nAside from the above, there is no functional change. The 'type' argument\nto sve_set_common() is only set to ARM64_VEC_SME (in ssve_set())) when\nsystem_supports_sme(), so the ARM64_VEC_SME case in the switch statement\nis still unreachable when !system_supports_sme(). When\nCONFIG_ARM64_SME=n, the only caller of sve_set_common() is sve_set(),\nand the compiler can constant-fold for the case where type is\nARM64_VEC_SVE, removing the logic for other cases."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/128a7494a9f15aad60cc6b7e3546bf481ac54a13", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f39984176e7edcaba3432b6c649c6fe93bf2f80", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
