This avoids\n  already some racy accesses.\n- In addition, now we try to check the state of the capture PCM stream\n  that may be stopped in this function, which was the major pain point\n  leading to UAF."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5727ccf9d19ca414cb76d9b647883822e2789c2e", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/826af7fa62e347464b1b4e0ba2fe19a92438084f", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bad15420050db1803767e58756114800cce91ea4", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
