In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 public-key encryption (PKE) implementation: the decrypt() path performs unchecked slice::split_at operations on input buffers derived from untrusted ciphertext. An attacker can submit short/undersized ciphertext or carefully-crafted DER-encoded structures to trigger bounds-check panics (Rust unwinding) which crash the calling thread or process. This issue has been patched via commit e60e991."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/commit/e60e99167a9a2b187ebe80c994c5204b0fdaf4ab", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/pull/1603", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/security/advisories/GHSA-j9xq-69pf-pcm8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://github.com/RustCrypto/elliptic-curves/security/advisories/GHSA-j9xq-69pf-pcm8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "CWE-20"}]}]}}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.6, "cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH"}}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
