The call may be on\nthe queue because MSG_PEEK was also passed and so the call was not dequeued\nor because the I/O thread requeued it.\n\nThe unconditional requeue may then corrupt the recvmsg queue, leading to\nthings like UAFs or refcount underruns.\n\nFix this by only requeuing the call if it isn't already on the queue - and\nmoving it to the front if it is already queued.  If we don't queue it, we\nhave to put the ref we obtained by dequeuing it.\n\nAlso, MSG_PEEK doesn't dequeue the call so shouldn't call\nrxrpc_notify_socket() for the call if we didn't use up all the data on the\nqueue, so fix that also."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2c28769a51deb6022d7fbd499987e237a01dd63a", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/930114425065f7ace6e0c0630fab4af75e059ea8", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
