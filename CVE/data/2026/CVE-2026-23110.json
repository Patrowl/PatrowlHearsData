These race conditions can\ncause the SCSI layer to fail to wake the error handler, leaving I/O\nthrough the SCSI host stuck as the error state cannot advance.\n\nFirst, there is an memory ordering issue within scsi_dec_host_busy().\nThe write which clears SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT may be reordered with reads\ncounting in scsi_host_busy(). While the local CPU will see its own\nwrite, reordering can allow other CPUs in scsi_dec_host_busy() or\nscsi_eh_inc_host_failed() to see a raised busy count, causing no CPU to\nsee a host busy equal to the host_failed count.\n\nThis race condition can be prevented with a memory barrier on the error\npath to force the write to be visible before counting host busy\ncommands.\n\nSecond, there is a general ordering issue with scsi_eh_inc_host_failed(). By\ncounting busy commands before incrementing host_failed, it can race with a\nfinal command in scsi_dec_host_busy(), such that scsi_dec_host_busy() does\nnot see host_failed incremented but scsi_eh_inc_host_failed() counts busy\ncommands before SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT is cleared by scsi_dec_host_busy(),\nresulting in neither waking the error handler task.\n\nThis needs the call to scsi_host_busy() to be moved after host_failed is\nincremented to close the race condition."}]}, "references": {"reference_data": [{"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/219f009ebfd1ef3970888ee9eef4c8a06357f862", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64ae21b9c4f0c7e60cf47a53fa7ab68852079ef0", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9fdc6f28d5e81350ab1d2cac8389062bd09e61e1", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}, {"url": "https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe2f8ad6f0999db3b318359a01ee0108c703a8c3", "name": "", "refsource": "", "tags": []}]}, "problemtype": {"problemtype_data": [{"description": [{"lang": "en", "value": "NVD-CWE-noinfo"}]}]}}, "impact": {}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}}
