During negotiation between a server and a client, the server may fail to give the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO and WILL commands because of improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes sends no response, because a fixed buffer space is available for all responses and that space may have been exhausted."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-09-05T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-09-05T19:15Z"}
