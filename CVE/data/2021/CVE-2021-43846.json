Versions of `solidus_frontend` prior to 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows a malicious site to add an item to the user's cart without their knowledge. Versions 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a patch for this issue. The patch adds CSRF token verification to the \"Add to cart\" action. Adding forgery protection to a form that missed it can have some side effects. Other CSRF protection strategies as well as a workaround involving modifcation to config/application.rb` are available. More details on these mitigations are available in the GitHub Security Advisory."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-12-20T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-12-20T22:15Z"}
