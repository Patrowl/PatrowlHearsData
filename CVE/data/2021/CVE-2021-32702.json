Versions before and including `1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error message. You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are using custom error handling that does not return the error message in an HTML response. Upgrade to version `1.4.1` to resolve. The fix adds basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your users."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-06-25T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-06-25T18:34Z"}
