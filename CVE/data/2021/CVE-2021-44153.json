When editing the license file, it is possible for an admin user to enable an option to run arbitrary executables, as demonstrated by an ISV demo \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\" entry. An attacker can exploit this to run a malicious binary on startup, or when triggering the Reread/Restart Servers function on the webserver. (Exploitation does not require CVE-2018-15573, because the license file is meant to be changed in the application.)"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-12-13T04:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-12-13T04:15Z"}
