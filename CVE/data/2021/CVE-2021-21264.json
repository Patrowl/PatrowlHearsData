A bypass of CVE-2020-26231 (fixed in 1.0.470/471 and 1.1.1) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-26231 & CVE-2020-15247. An authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2. As a workaround, apply https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/f63519ff1e8d375df30deba63156a2fc97aa9ee7 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndIncluding": "1.0.471", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:october:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "1.1.0", "versionEndIncluding": "1.1.1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "HIGH", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "LOW", "baseScore": 5.2, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.1, "impactScore": 3.7}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P", "accessVector": "LOCAL", "accessComplexity": "MEDIUM", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "PARTIAL", "integrityImpact": "PARTIAL", "availabilityImpact": "PARTIAL", "baseScore": 4.4}, "severity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 3.4, "impactScore": 6.4, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": true}}, "publishedDate": "2021-05-03T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T05:47Z"}
