This occurs because node IDs are predictable (with incrementing numbers) and the access control on Services/NodeManagement.asmx/DeleteObjNow is incorrect. To exploit this, an attacker must be authenticated and must have node management rights associated with at least one valid group on the platform."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-07-30T14:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-07-30T15:16Z"}
