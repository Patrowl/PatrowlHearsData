In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability which enables MITM modification of request bodies that are meant to have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z. As a workaround one can avoid using \"aws-chunked\" encoding-based chunk signature upload requests instead use TLS. MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-03-19T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-03-19T17:15Z"}
