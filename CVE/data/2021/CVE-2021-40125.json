An attacker with the ability to spoof a trusted IKEv2 site-to-site VPN peer and in possession of valid IKEv2 credentials for that peer could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed, authenticated IKEv2 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the device.\r "}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-10-27T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-10-27T19:35Z"}
