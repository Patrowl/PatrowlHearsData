Prior to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, Nextcloud Server did not implement a database backend for rate-limiting purposes. Any component of Nextcloud using rate-limits (as as `AnonRateThrottle` or `UserRateThrottle`) was thus not rate limited on instances not having a memory cache backend configured. In the case of a default installation, this would notably include the rate-limits on the two factor codes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, or 22.2.0. As a workaround, enable a memory cache backend in `config.php`."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "22.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "22.2.0", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "21.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "21.0.5", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "20.0.13", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "HIGH", "baseScore": 8.1, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 5.2}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "SINGLE", "confidentialityImpact": "PARTIAL", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "PARTIAL", "baseScore": 5.5}, "severity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 8.0, "impactScore": 4.9, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2021-10-25T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:25Z"}
