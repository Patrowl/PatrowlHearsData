In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.2, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into a HedgeDoc note, which is executed when the note is viewed in slide mode.

The problem is patched in HedgeDoc 1.7.2. ### Workarounds Disallow loading JavaScript from 3rd party sites using the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
