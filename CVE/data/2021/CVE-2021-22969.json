Please note that Cloud IAAS provider mis-configurations are not Concrete CMS vulnerabilities. A mitigation for this vulnerability is to make sure that the IMDS configurations are according to a cloud provider's best practices.This fix is also in Concrete version 9.0.0"}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-11-19T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-11-19T21:49Z"}
