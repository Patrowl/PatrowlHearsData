NOTE: It is asserted that this issue requires social engineering a user into connecting to a fake VNC Server. The VNC Viewer application they are using will then hang, until terminated, but no memory leak occurs - the resources are freed once the hung process is terminated and the resource usage is constant during the hang. Only the process that is connected to the fake Server is affected. This is an application bug, not a security issue."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-09-17T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-09-24T16:15Z"}
