An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an authenticated user of the DCNM web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to the Device Manager application, which provides access to network devices managed by the system.\r \r "}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-01-20T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-01-20T20:25Z"}
