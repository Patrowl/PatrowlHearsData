The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to patched versions 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0. As a workaround, use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "11.0.0", "versionEndExcluding": "11.1.2", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "10.0.7", "cpe_name": []}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:talk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "10.1.0", "versionEndExcluding": "10.1.4", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "LOW", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.1, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.8, "impactScore": 2.7}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "MEDIUM", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "NONE", "integrityImpact": "PARTIAL", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 4.3}, "severity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 8.6, "impactScore": 2.9, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": true}}, "publishedDate": "2021-11-15T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:18Z"}
