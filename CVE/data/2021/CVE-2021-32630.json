In Admidio before version 4.0.4, there is an authenticated RCE via .phar file upload. A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc). The vulnerability is patched in version 4.0.4."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-05-20T17:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-05-20T17:15Z"}
