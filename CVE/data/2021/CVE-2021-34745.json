This vulnerability is due to the .NET Agent Coordinator Service executing code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker with local access to a device that is running the vulnerable agent could create a custom process that would be launched with those SYSTEM privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is fixed in AppDynamics .NET Agent Release 21.7."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-08-18T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-08-18T20:15Z"}
