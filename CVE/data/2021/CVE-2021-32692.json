Versions prior to 0.11.0 allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on any macOS machine with ActivityWatch running. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by having the user visiting a website with the page title set to a malicious string. An attacker could use another application to accomplish the same, but the web browser is the most likely attack vector. This issue is patched in version 0.11.0. As a workaround, users can run the latest version of aw-watcher-window from source, or manually patch the `printAppTitle.scpt` file."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2022-12-23T03:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2022-12-23T03:31Z"}
