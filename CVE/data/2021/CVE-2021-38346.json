While the plugin added a .jpg extension to all uploaded filenames, a double extension attack was still possible, e.g. a file named shell.php would be saved as shell.php.jpg, and would be executable on a number of common configurations."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:brizy:brizy-page_builder:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionEndIncluding": "2.3.11", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "SINGLE", "confidentialityImpact": "PARTIAL", "integrityImpact": "PARTIAL", "availabilityImpact": "PARTIAL", "baseScore": 6.5}, "severity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 8.0, "impactScore": 6.4, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2021-10-14T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:16Z"}
