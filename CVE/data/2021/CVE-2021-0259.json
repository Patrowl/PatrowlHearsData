If an attacker on a client device on the overlay network sends a high volume of specific, legitimate traffic in the overlay network, due to an improperly detected DDoS violation, the leaf might not process certain L2 traffic, sent by spines in the underlay network. Continued receipt and processing of the high volume traffic will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5K Series: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S8; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S5; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S6, 18.4R3-S6; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6, 19.2R3-S2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S2, 20.3R2.
