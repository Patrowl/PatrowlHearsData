In OneDev before version 4.0.3, AttachmentUploadServlet also saves user controlled data (`request.getInputStream()`) to a user specified location (`request.getHeader(\"File-Name\")`). This issue may lead to arbitrary file upload which can be used to upload a WebShell to OneDev server. This issue is addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing uploaded file to be in attachments folder.
