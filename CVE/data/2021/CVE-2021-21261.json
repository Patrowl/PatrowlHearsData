A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.9.4. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.9.4."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "0.11.4", "versionEndExcluding": "1.8.5"}, {"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:flatpak:flatpak:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*", "versionStartIncluding": "1.9.1", "versionEndExcluding": "1.10.0"}]}, {"operator": "OR", "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "attackVector": "LOCAL", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "CHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "LOW", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.3, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 2.0, "impactScore": 4.7}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C", "accessVector": "LOCAL", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "COMPLETE", "integrityImpact": "COMPLETE", "availabilityImpact": "COMPLETE", "baseScore": 7.2}, "severity": "HIGH", "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 10.0, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2021-01-14T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-01-22T01:49Z"}
