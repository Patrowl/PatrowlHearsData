This vulnerability is due to an overly descriptive error message on the dashboard that appears when a user attempts to modify their email address when the new address already exists in the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to modify the user's email address. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate email addresses of users in the system."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-11-04T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-11-04T16:19Z"}
