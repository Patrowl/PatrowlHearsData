The full path to the command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects Windows installers."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-10-29T12:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-10-29T12:15Z"}
