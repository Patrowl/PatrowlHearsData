Continued receipted of a flood will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the flood subsides the system will recover by itself. An indication that the system is affected by this issue would be that kernel and netisr process are shown to be using a lot of CPU cycles like in the following example output: user@host> show system processes extensive ...
