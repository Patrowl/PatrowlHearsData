Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint. In versions prior to 3.16.1, the Nextcloud Android client skipped a step that involved the client checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.16.1. As a workaround, do not add additional end-to-end encrypted devices to a user account."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": [{"operator": "OR", "children": [], "cpe_match": [{"vulnerable": true, "cpe23Uri": "cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*", "versionEndExcluding": "3.16.1", "cpe_name": []}]}]}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "LOW", "privilegesRequired": "NONE", "userInteraction": "NONE", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 7.5, "baseSeverity": "HIGH"}, "exploitabilityScore": 3.9, "impactScore": 3.6}, "baseMetricV2": {"cvssV2": {"version": "2.0", "vectorString": "AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N", "accessVector": "NETWORK", "accessComplexity": "LOW", "authentication": "NONE", "confidentialityImpact": "PARTIAL", "integrityImpact": "NONE", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 5.0}, "severity": "MEDIUM", "exploitabilityScore": 10.0, "impactScore": 2.9, "acInsufInfo": false, "obtainAllPrivilege": false, "obtainUserPrivilege": false, "obtainOtherPrivilege": false, "userInteractionRequired": false}}, "publishedDate": "2021-07-12T21:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:07Z"}
