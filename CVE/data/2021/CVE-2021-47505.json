This is okay for blocking polls, since a\nblocking poll occurs within one task; however, non-blocking polls\nrequire another solution.  This solution is for the queue to be cleared\nbefore it is freed, by sending a POLLFREE notification to all waiters.\n\nUnfortunately, only eventpoll handles POLLFREE.  A second type of\nnon-blocking poll, aio poll, was added in kernel v4.18, and it doesn't\nhandle POLLFREE.  This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd or\nbinder fd is polled with aio poll, and the waitqueue gets freed.\n\nFix this by making aio poll handle POLLFREE.\n\nA patch by Ramji Jiyani <ramjiyani@google.com>\n(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211027011834.2497484-1-ramjiyani@google.com)\ntried to do this by making aio_poll_wake() always complete the request\ninline if POLLFREE is seen.  However, that solution had two bugs.\nFirst, it introduced a deadlock, as it unconditionally locked the aio\ncontext while holding the waitqueue lock, which inverts the normal\nlocking order.  Second, it didn't consider that POLLFREE notifications\nare missed while the request has been temporarily de-queued.\n\nThe second problem was solved by my previous patch.  This patch then\nproperly fixes the use-after-free by handling POLLFREE in a\ndeadlock-free way.  It does this by taking advantage of the fact that\nfreeing of the waitqueue is RCU-delayed, similar to what eventpoll does."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-24T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:36Z"}
