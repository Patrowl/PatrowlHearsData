Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the ReportTemplateController class. When parsing the path parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.
