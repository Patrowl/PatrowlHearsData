The vulnerability is due to a logic error when processing specific link-local IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that would flow inbound through the wired interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic drops in the affected VLAN, thus triggering the DoS condition."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-09-23T03:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-09-23T11:51Z"}
