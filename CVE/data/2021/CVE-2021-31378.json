These spoofed messages cause the Junos OS General Authentication Service (authd) daemon to force the broadband subscriber into this \"Terminating\" state which the subscriber will not recover from thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to the endpoint device. Once in the \"Terminating\" state, the endpoint subscriber will no longer be able to access the network. Restarting the authd daemon on the Junos OS device will temporarily clear the subscribers out of the \"Terminating\" state. As long as the attacker continues to send these spoofed packets and subscribers request to be logged out, the subscribers will be returned to the \"Terminating\" state thereby creating a persistent Denial of Service to the subscriber. An indicator of compromise may be seen by displaying the output of \"show subscribers summary\". The presence of subscribers in the \"Terminating\" state may indicate the issue is occurring.
