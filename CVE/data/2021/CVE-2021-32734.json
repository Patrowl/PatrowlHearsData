In versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.011, and 21.0.3, the Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud Server returned verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. The issue was fixed in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. As a workaround, one may disable the Nextcloud Text application in Nextcloud Server app settings."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-07-12T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-07-12T22:15Z"}
