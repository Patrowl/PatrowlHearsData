If GPIO chipselects are specified in the\ndevice tree for more than 3 slaves, num_chipselect is silently raised by\nof_spi_get_gpio_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses to\nthe statically-sized array prepare_cs[].\n\nAs a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number of\nallowed slaves to 24 (which \"ought to be enough for anybody\"), enforce\nthe limitation on slave ->setup and revert num_chipselect to 3 (which is\nthe number of native chipselects supported by the controller).\nAn upcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-21T15:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-11-21T06:35Z"}
