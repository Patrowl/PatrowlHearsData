It was therefore possible to access the application through a user whose credentials were not known, without any attempt by the testers to modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of the session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated GET Request to the Home Page and adding an arbitrary value to the JSESSIONID field. The application, following the login, does not assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the identifier of the entire session. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-10-05T16:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-10-05T16:40Z"}
