By using this buffer overflow, a remote attacker can start the telnetd service. This service has a hardcoded default username and password (root/123456). Although it has a restrictive shell, this can be easily bypassed via the built-in ECHO shell command."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2023-05-31T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2023-05-31T20:15Z"}
