The Nextcloud Contacts application prior to version 4.0.3 was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab. Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Contacts application is upgraded to 4.0.3. As a workaround, one may use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {"baseMetricV3": {"cvssV3": {"version": "3.1", "vectorString": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N", "attackVector": "NETWORK", "attackComplexity": "HIGH", "privilegesRequired": "LOW", "userInteraction": "REQUIRED", "scope": "UNCHANGED", "confidentialityImpact": "HIGH", "integrityImpact": "HIGH", "availabilityImpact": "NONE", "baseScore": 6.4, "baseSeverity": "MEDIUM"}, "exploitabilityScore": 1.2, "impactScore": 5.2}}, "publishedDate": "2021-10-25T19:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-10-26T02:20Z"}
