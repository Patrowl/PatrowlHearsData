FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition file."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-07-12T23:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-07-13T00:15Z"}
