In particular, if an image contains malicious code in addition to the actual picture, this code is executed on app.wire.com. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. The vulnerability was patched in version 2021-06-01-production.0. As a workaround, users should not try to open image URLs."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-06-15T20:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-06-15T20:38Z"}
