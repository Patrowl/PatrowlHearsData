With this\nkernel version, -EPROBE_DEFER is returned the first time\ndsps_setup_optional_vbus_irq() is called which triggers the probe to\nerror out without unregistering the platform device. Unfortunately, on\nthe Beagle Bone Black Wireless, the platform device still living in the\nsystem is being used by the USB Ethernet gadget driver, which during the\nboot phase triggers the crash.\n\nMy limited knowledge of the musb world prevents me to revert this commit\nwhich was sent to silence a robot warning which, as far as I understand,\ndoes not make sense. The goal of this patch was to prevent an IRQ to\nfire before the platform device being registered. I think this cannot\never happen due to the fact that enabling the interrupts is done by the\n->enable() callback of the platform musb device, and this platform\ndevice must be already registered in order for the core or any other\nuser to use this callback.\n\nHence, I decided to fix the error path, which might prevent future\nerrors on mainline kernels while also fixing older ones."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2024-05-22T07:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2024-05-22T07:15Z"}
