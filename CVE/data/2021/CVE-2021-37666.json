In affected versions an attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant`.

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit be7a4de6adfbd303ce08be4332554dff70362612. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."}]}}, "configurations": {"CVE_data_version": "4.0", "nodes": []}, "impact": {}, "publishedDate": "2021-08-12T22:15Z", "lastModifiedDate": "2021-08-12T23:06Z"}
