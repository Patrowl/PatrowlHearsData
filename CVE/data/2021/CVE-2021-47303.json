This allows reference counting and cleanup to be done on the latter\nwhich simplifies their management a bit. The aux->poke_tab struct, however,\ndid not follow this logic. The initial proposed fix for this use-after-free\nbug further embedded poke data tracking into the subprogram with proper\nreference counting. However, Daniel and Alexei questioned why we were treating\nthese objects special; I agree, its unnecessary. The fix here removes the per\nsubprogram poke table allocation and map tracking and instead simply points\nthe aux->poke_tab pointer at the main programs poke table. This way, map\ntracking is simplified to the main program and we do not need to manage them\nper subprogram.\n\nThis also means, bpf_prog_free_deferred(), which unwinds the program reference\ncounting and kfrees objects, needs to ensure that we don't try to double free\nthe poke_tab when free'ing the subprog structures. This is easily solved by\nNULL'ing the poke_tab pointer. The second detail is to ensure that per\nsubprogram JIT logic only does fixups on poke_tab[] entries it owns. To do\nthis, we add a pointer in the poke structure to point at the subprogram value\nso JITs can easily check while walking the poke_tab structure if the current\nentry belongs to the current program. The aux pointer is stable and therefore\nsuitable for such comparison. On the jit_subprogs() error path, we omit\ncleaning up the poke->aux field because these are only ever referenced from\nthe JIT side, but on error we will never make it to the JIT, so its fine to\nleave them dangling. Removing these pointers would complicate the error path\nfor no reason. However, we do need to untrack all poke descriptors from the\nmain program as otherwise they could race with the freeing of JIT memory from\nthe subprograms.
